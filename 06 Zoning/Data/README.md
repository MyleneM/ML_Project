<img align="center" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/959/1*f9eTYqByATeZLmsBIOkD-Q.png"/>

- (1) Feature Engineering: Creating more variables based on reviews
- (2) Zoning Cleanup: Make sure to have only one block of color in one review
- (3) Feature Selection: Test various method to select parameters of regularization
- (4) Feature Scale and Regularization: for model that needs it rescale quantitative variables
- (5) Test more models
- (6) Hyperparameter Tuning
- (7) Create some specific loss for the model if needed
- (8)  Combine models in a voting algorithm to make the approach more robust (Train + Test + Validation - Accuracy)
