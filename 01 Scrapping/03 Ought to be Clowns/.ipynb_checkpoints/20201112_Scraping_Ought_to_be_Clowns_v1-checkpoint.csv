0,0,Ought To Be Clowns,09/08/2019,Ian,Evita, Open Air Theatre,"If this was the production of Evita that was forever touring the UK, then we could all be a hell of a lot more enthused about the future of UK theatre. Bill Kenwright might have the business side locked down with dull predictability but at the Open Air Theatre, Jamie Lloyd is unleashing a torrent of creative genius which proves inordinately exciting to witness. He offers up a complete reimagining of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical and one which feels sparkingly fresh in every single aspect. The open bleachers of Soutra Gilmore’s design which turns our focus to the human relationships here, the striking physicality of Fabian Aloise’s choreography with its haunting screaming faces and way-cool domino effect points to societal trauma and most crucially, Lloyd allows the shadow of populist politics to loom large. So Samantha Pauly’s thoroughly contemporary Eva is unafraid to let the rougher edges of her youthful confidence show – the way ‘Don’t Cry For Me Argentina’ is undercut is a masterclass in insincerity akin to Donald Trump’s autocue reading. And when she meets her partner in ruthless ambition – a superb Ektor Rivera as Juan Perón – there’s a chilling effectiveness to their work. ‘A New Argentina’ becomes a full-on political rally, a riot of albiceleste tickertape and smoke cannons."
1,1,Ought To Be Clowns,14/02/2012,Ian,Miss Julie, Faction at New Diorama,"Miss Julie is the third iteration of the Faction rep season at the New Diorama, though there’s been a bit of a gap for me between seeing this and the brilliant first two –Twelfth Night and Mary Stuart. And I’m not sure if it was the gap, my feelings that night or perhaps the company stretching themselves just a little bit too far, but I did not take to Strindberg’s play half as much as I did the others. Part of it came from the feeling that this was more of an afterthought than an integral part of the rep season – it seems an odd choice for the company to choose with an ensemble at work as the play is a three-hander at heart. Miss Julie is a Count’s daughter but rather than attend the formal ball being put on by her father, she opts to go to the party being held by the servants where she embarks on a dangerous flirtation with footman Jean. And with it being a three-hander, the rest of the ensemble play the various revellers who are mainly engaged in the making of sound effects to accompany the mimed actions of the actors. So much of Faction’s work has been clever and innovative and there’s no doubting that these are endlessly inventive in their scope and creation. But it is hard to shake the feeling that it’s not really fully integrated into the action, indeed it is often quite a distraction from the action onstage. Having seen the company working twice before, I was most keen to see Leonie Hill take on a lead role as she was twice scene-stealingly excellent, but something was a little amiss as Miss Julie. There’s no real sense of her distinctness from the serving classes or the kind of range that she suggested she was more than capable of. Chemistry with Cary Crankson’s Jean was somehow lacking too, no hidden depth s emerging from his performance to suggest why he has such a pull, and Kate Sawyer’s Kristen, the cook who also has a connection to Jean, likewise failed to live up to her earlier work."
2,2,Ought To Be Clowns,21/08/2014,Ian,Thérèse Raquin, Park Theatre,"A well-deserved transfer for this hit Finborough musical although coming a few months after that original run, the production has had to be recast a bit along with being reconceived for the larger space of the Park Theatre. On a personal note, whilst I loved being able to listen to the pleasingly textured score once again, it was also interesting to come back to the show with a much greater knowledge of the story, having recently seen both a play and a film of Thérèse Raquin, thus enabling me to compare and contrast adaptations. This version hedges its bets from the beginning by describing itself as a “radical adaptation” by Nona Shepphard but what is interesting is that Shepphard is the only one who tries to replicate something of Thérèse’s interior life, which is so richly portrayed in the novel, by using a chorus of three river women. It works both dramatically and musically, creating additional layers to the vocals and these hints of Greek tragedy with its chorus passing commentary is used effectively elsewhere, most notably in reporting the news of Camille’s tragic ‘accident’. The musical complexity of Craig Adams’ score also works well here, eschewing anything that might be considered a breakout pop hit for the rhythmic repetition of domino numbers (which recalls London Road as much as anything) and James Simpson’s band of keys and strings sound as lush as ever, filling the theatre with glorious sound as the walls close in on Julie Atherton’s Thérèse and Greg Barnett’s Laurent following their surrender to base desires and some serious cat abuse."
3,3,Ought To Be Clowns,23/03/2011,Ian,Anna Karenina, Arcola,"This production of Anna Karenina at the Arcola Theatre is a revival of one from 1992 by Shared Experience, presented here by The Piano Removal Company, a new company formed out of a recently graduating group from the Birmingham School of Acting, whose final show there was this. Helen Edmundson’s adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s novel reworks the story into a conversation between the two central characters of Anna and Levin as they debate freedom versus duty whilst their stories are told in rapidly-played episodes, hers of pursuing an illicit love at the expense of her son and her position in society and his of trying to find meaning in life, even if it means losing the chance to love. Director Max Webster wears his previous connections to Complicite on his sleeve and the resulting visual aesthetic therefore feels quite familiar: the swift scene changes and multiple role-playing, the exaggerated physicality of much of the movement and moments of striking imagery through simply used props. It works well, creating some elegant scenes of candlelit beauty, spotlit conversations and paper snowfalls as well as working in a wry sense of humour with Vronsky’s omnipresence. But there is just so much of this physical staging with its relentless changes which doesn’t always add value to the production and pad out the running time unnecessarily. This energy in the storytelling fits in with the attempt to create a timeless feel rather than a strictly observed period drama, something the sound and live music also worked at with varying results. Melodic passages of guitar strumming and piano runs were fine, but a rendition of Bob Dylan’s ‘Don’t Think Twice It’s Alright’ jarred where the acapella singing of a Russian peasant folk song with a whirling foot-stamping dance proved much more stirring and perhaps evidence of some overthinking. And Edmundson’s adaptation could withstand some pruning, it takes a long time to get not very far in the second half."
4,4,Ought To Be Clowns,10/04/2015,mag9l,Shooting With Light, New Diorama,"There’s much to enjoy about Idle Motion’s Shooting with Light, currently selling out night after night at the New Diorama ahead of a UK tour, not least in their exploration of the life and work of photojournalist Gerda Taro. A devised work, it blends its text with striking use of movement, multimedia projections and innovative design, to create an impassioned, time-jumping romance slash mystery that has some truly beguiling moments. Fleeing the rising anti-Semitism of the 1930s, German Gerta Pohorylle and Hungarian Andre Friedmann met in a Parisian café and quickly bonding over a mutual love for each other and photography, reinvented themselves as the First Couple of photojournalism – Gerda Taro and Robert Capa. Initially just acting his agent, Taro’s own love for the lens saw her develop her own path, becoming the first female photojournalist to cover a war from the front line. And to die whilst doing so. Idle Motion leave us in no doubt as to the depth of feeling Taro had both for her partner and for her work. Arresting sequences see her connect gorgeously with her lover under the red light of the darkroom or the twinkling night sky, and her determination to capture images of a burned out village in the Spanish Civil War is hauntingly effective. When the movement has a definitive purpose as it does here, it elevates the production exquisitely and Sophie Cullen and Tom Radford really shine."
5,5,Ought To Be Clowns,24/10/2013,Ian,Blood Wedding, Courtyard Theatre,"Lorca’s writing is suffused with the heat and passion of his Spanish homeland and his 1932 play Blood Wedding is one of his most famous and oft-performed works. Aria Entertainment’s production uses Tanya Ronder’s recent translation but director Bronagh Lagan often struggles to combine the lyrical poetry and brutal realities of this play, introducing a too-wide range of elements that crowd the essential simplicity of the story. The show is at its best when it allows simple but striking images to emerge – Miles Yekinni’s Death – a presence haunting the action from the off – appearing unexpectedly from behind a door; the true desire of the Bride breaking free in the middle of a densely choreographed wedding dance; the erect pride with which the Mother conducts herself at all times. And in these moments , this tragic tale of love and betrayal captures the right level of magic realism.   Elsewhere, the stage feels cluttered by devices and technique which muddy the narrative rather than elucidating it. Lewis Greenslade’s compositions are atmospheric but lack specificity; the choreography a little too precise to convince; and even Francisco Rodriguez-Weil’s well-intentioned and evocative set with its multiple doors lacks something in its execution – the idea of the claustrophobia of village life marred by its inherent inflexibility.  Performances are mostly strong though, able to invest the colloquialisms of Ronder’s adaptation with greater feeling than they perhaps deserve. Matt Wilman’s powerfully masculine Leonardo a visceral presence, Lynsey Beauchamp’s Mother a fierce example of vengeful Andalusian spirit and Nicola Duffett a wonderfully gossipy neighbour, making a single word “well…” speak volumes. Unexpectedly, the star turn comes from Cassidy Janson’s Servant, a gorgeously natural stage presence. "
6,6,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2018,Ian,Chess, London Coliseum,"It’s taken over 30 years for Chess to return to the West End (though it was seen at the Union in 2013) and though it has a huge amount of resource thrown at it in Laurence Connor’s production for English National Opera, it doesn’t necessarily feel worth the wait. An 80’s mega-musical through and through with an intermittently cracking score from ABBA’s Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, Richard Nelson’s book hasn’t aged particularly well and bears the hallmarks of the  substantial tinkering it has had at every opportunity. It’s not too hard to see why it has needed the tinkering. The mix of Cold War politics told through the prism of rival US and Soviet chess Grandmasters, love triangles and power ballads is a tricky one to get right and part of the problem seems to be just how seriously to take it all. On the one hand, the chess matches are backgrounded with montages of the real-life tensions of the 80s; on the other, scenes that take us through the various locations of the tournaments are a cringeworthy riot of cultural stereotyping that revel in their utter kitsch.  The result is an unbalanced production which doesn’t quite convince. A deliberately naff 80s design aesthetic comes up hard against state-of-the-art live video and projection work on two giant screens either side of the stage. Anders Eljas’ arrangements, fleshed out by the ENO’s hefty chorus and orchestra, are nixed by a punishing sound balance which obscures much of Tim Rice’s lyrical content. The saving grace comes with a suite of strong performances who nail the high points of that score. Michael Ball soars effortlessly through ‘Anthem’ as the stern Russian Anatoly, a direct contrast to the wilder American Freddie, a raucous Tim Howar who brings down the house with ‘Pity The Child’. The marvellous Cassidy Janson dispatches Florence, sometime lover to both, with her customary élan, especially on a glorious ‘Nobody’s Side’. And Alexandra Burke does well with the underwritten part of Svetlana, successfully transitioning (for the most part) from her pop inclinations to a legit straight MT interpretation of the material. Strong work too comes from Phillip Browne and Cedric Neal. "
7,7,Ought To Be Clowns,27/07/2011,Ian,Double Feature 2, National Theatre,"Switching it up a little for the summer is the National Theatre with their Double Feature run: 2 double bills of new writing performed by one ensemble and playing in a new space, the Paintframe. It wasn’t always meant to be thus, the original plan was to put this into the Cottesloe but the huge success of London Road and its subsequent extension meant alternative arrangements had to be found and so the area where sets are painted was co-opted, a rather neat decision as it plays into the experimental feel of the whole experience. Divided into 2 double bills, I saw Double Feature 2 first, at the first preview, which pairs Prasanna Puwanarajah’s Nightwatchman and Tom Basden’s There Is A War. I ummed and aahed a bit about how to write up these shows and so what will follow is a general overview of the plays and the experience as a whole, and there will be two separate reviews of the actual shows which will be a bit more detailed and so potentially spoilerific. Nightwatchman is the debut play by Prasanna Puwanarajah, an actor with numerous credits at the National including currently appearing in Emperor and Galilean. It is a monologue delivered by a British/Sri Lankan female cricketer on the night before making her debut at Lords playing for England, against Sri Lanka to boot. Unable to settle, Abirami works out her frustrations in a practise area with a machine spitting cricket balls at her as she battles with her own issues of national identity given her multicultural background, delves into some murky family history and their involvement in the Sri Lankan conflict and also talks a lot about cricket. It is impressively performed by Stephanie Street but Puwanarajah’s writing doesn’t quite hit the spot. For such a short piece, his canvas is far too broad, touching on many topics but not tackling any sufficiently and requiring too much advance knowledge in order to be truly effective: Nightwatchman is simply not able to be illuminating enough of its own accord. There is a War is Tom Basden’s written contribution to Double Feature, he acts in both this and another play too, and this plays as the second half of the evening. A story about a slightly surreal war going on in a slightly surreal land, Basden uses his customary sharp humour to dissect much of the ridiculousness that surrounds a society at war. Following young doctor Anne’s attempts to find a hospital and assist the war effort, we see her desperate journey as things turn increasingly darker as the play progresses. Featuring pretty much the full ensemble here in a range of random characters that Phoebe Fox’s Anne encounters on her way, there’s much more energy to this piece, also played in traverse. It also starts off with some brilliantly comic scenes which were genuinely hilarious – I kind of love Kirsty Bushell now – but much like Anne’s journey which wanders aimlessly around, Basden’s writing loses focus quite badly, yet still continues and so a more serious tone takes over but with little sense of what is actually being said. An ending is finally meandered to but not after some time and so despite the promising beginning, the patience was definitely tested here. As a converted space and one which is intentionally so very flexible, the temporary seating is a set of cushioned benches (you can ring up to book the back row so you have something to lean against if you have worries about this) and both of these shows were played in traverse. It wasn’t the most uncomfortable of evenings truth be told but I suppose it depends on how involved you get: Nightwatchman became more of a trial because I wasn’t enjoying the show… But the most perplexing thing about the whole shebang is the decision to start the shows off at 8.15pm. With a scheduled running time of 2 hours 30 minutes, this means that it doesn’t finish until 10.45pm at the earliest which is frankly ridiculous given that these are not long shows."
8,8,Ought To Be Clowns,07/12/2009,Ian,Entertaining Mr Sloane, Trafalgar Studios,"After a discussion over the weekend about people who have not yet been made Dames and damn well ought to be, Imelda Staunton’s name came up amongst others (Fiona Shaw and Juliet Stevenson being my other choices), but when I had a check on this blog for the delightful Ms Staunton, I saw no mention of her despite being sure I had seen her earlier this year. Eventually I remembered it was Entertaining Mr Sloane at the Trafalgar Studios, way back in February, but somehow I’d neglected to write up the review. As I want this blog to be a full record of my theatregoing, I’m just going to make a few comments about what I remember of it with the help of some notes I made back then. The play, written by Joe Orton in 1964, is one of the darkest comedies I think I have ever seen. In brief, a landlady and her brother are both overwhelmed with sexual desire when a charismatic young lodger moves into her house. Caught in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse as his psychopathic tendencies come to the fore, as the balance of power continually shifts around them in this battle for power and possession. As the duelling sister and brother, Imelda Staunton and Simon Paisley Day had a crackling chemistry as their cosy existence is shattered by the sexual tension brought in by the arrival of the eponymous Mr Sloane played by Mathew Horne. In a well-designed letterbox set peeling away at the edges, Staunton was brilliant in a caustically funny, highly revealing(!) performance which veered grotesquely from demanding that Sloane call her Mamma whilst seducing him to the endearing lonely side of her that is frequently exposed. That said, Paisley-Day’s homosexually repressed Ed was a absolute sheer joy to watch. His struggle to conceal his instant reactions to the leather clad intruder with a bristling insouciance was hysterical. Mathew Horne suffered a little bit by comparison to these two performances, especially with a shaky Midlands accent (at least early on in the run), but he did well at conveying the casual ruthlessness of Sloane as he turns this world upside down."
9,9,Ought To Be Clowns,30/05/2015,mag9l,The Theory of Relativity, Drayton Arms,"Given that in ‘Quiet’, Matilda is giving West End audiences lessons on the speed of light, it is brave of another show to enter into the same arena but given the college student age of the protagonists here, one can forgive writer Brian Hill and composer Neil Bartram. Their show The Theory of Relativity, previously seen in Toronto, lies somewhere between chamber musical, song cycle and even revue as eight characters explore the random connections in life (a popular theme this week after buckets) and discover the web of links that result from our actions, even if we’re unaware of how far-reaching they truly are. The US college bias of the writing skews the experience a little but most of the trials and tribulations experienced here are universally felt – the fluttering nerves of first loves and coming out, dealing with upheaval and change, the pain of loss of love or life. And a large part of the relatability comes from the warmth and openness of the performances here – Jodie Steele’s affecting heartbreak in ‘Me and Ricky’, Ina Marie Smith’s plaintive lament for her mother in ‘Promise Me’, Joshua LeClair’s powerfully felt ‘Footprint’, all supported by some fine work from MD Barney Ashworth from the keyboard. Christopher Lane’s production keeps a vigour to proceedings, ensuring the key note of each segment powers through, perhaps a little unsubtly in the case of the OCD sufferer but more amusingly with the numbers nerd (the excellent Simon Bailey) and downright hilariously with life choices of ‘Apples and Oranges’ which is pretty much worth the admission fee thanks to LeClair and Curtis Brown. Bartram’s music has the occasional tendency to noodle about when a concise approach would seem more apt and though the way in which physics is used to underscore each scene, it doesn’t always feel like the most natural fit."
10,10,Ought To Be Clowns,17/08/2014,Ian,Laughing Matters with Celia Imrie, St James Studio,
11,11,Ought To Be Clowns,02/03/2019,Ian,The Importance of Being Earnest, Tara Arts,"In so many ways, it is a real shame that it is only now, after Classic Spring’s year-long West End Oscar Wilde season, that we’re seeing theatre companies finally showing some real invention and daring in reinterpreting his work. For all their star-studded casts, these were largely faithfully traditional renditions that did little to stir any real excitement. To be fair, these aren’t plays that lend themselves easily to being lifted out of their very specific social milieu. But equally, it is difficult to get too enthused about endless identikit revivals. Which is a long-winded way of saying I was most excited to go see Two Gents and Tara Arts’ production of The Importance of Being Earnest which remakes the show as a two-hander for 2 British-African women. It’s an entirely fresh take and a bold move and its one which often pays dividends. Directors Arne Pohlmeier and Tonderai Munyevu don’t so much dismantle the fourth wall as never even acknowledge it ever existed (shy people should avoid the front row) and thoroughly reimagine the play in the kind of contemporary multicultural context that frankly deserves West End audiences."
12,12,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2014,Ian,The Distance, Orange Tree,"Paul Miller’s subtle reinvention of the Orange Tree continues apace with Deborah Bruce’s The Distance, an exploration of a more complex side to parenting and friendship that is challenged when one of their group suddenly returns from Australia. Bea emigrated there to get married and have two beautiful kids but she’s turned up on best friend Kate’s Sussex doorstep alone and with their other good friend Alex also there to lend support, they to sort out Bea’s life for her, little suspecting what it is that Bea has actually done. Truth be told, I wasn’t the hugest fan of Bruce’s first play Godchild which premiered downstairs at Hampstead last year but the chance to see Helen Baxendale return to the stage tempted me over to Richmond. There’s much to appreciate in the amusing and frank way Bruce depicts how parenthood, and different experiences thereof, affects the tight bonds of friendship. The ease with which Baxendale’s Bea, Clare Lawrence-Moody’s Kate and Emma Beattie’s Alex interact with each other is brilliantly portrayed as they bicker and banter and nurture and natter – their lives don’t stop because of Bea’s dilemma, it just has to fit into the tumble of jigsaw pieces that makes up the hustle and bustle of everyday living and so gets added to the ever-growing list of things that need to get sorted. The inclusion of the London riots is a canny move here, not as a focal point for the play but just a backdrop of a world still spinning. And with everyone having their own set of internal priorities, their approaches differ. As a relatively new mother who struggled through years of IVF, Kate cannot conceive of a world that is not predicated on the expression of maternal love and that drives her every action; whilst Alex, a single mother of three boys including a winsome teenager Liam, is more open to letting Bea – and pretty much anyone – do what they want. On top of that though, Bea’s putative articulation of exactly what it is she has decided still comes as an eye-opener, the deviation from the societal norm highly intriguing in Baxendale’s well-modulated performance."
13,13,Ought To Be Clowns,31/10/2015,mag9l,The State Vs John Hayes, King’s Head,"More of us have voices in our head than we would care to admit but how many of us truly give them the time of day. Sitting in her cell on Death Row, Elyese Dukie is one such person, accused of the murder of two people but adamant that John Hayes was responsible, and it is Hayes’ face who looks back at her from the mirror and who we first meet in The State Vs John Hayes, now playing at the King’s Head Theatre as part of their new writing festival. Developed out of extensive research into female killers, this one-woman show is written and performed by Lucy Roslyn and is hauntingly effective. In this Texas prison cell, this complex character ricochets between extremes, between John and Elyese, as we delve into the interior life she won’t reveal to the courts or the psychiatrists, drawing ever closer to horrible truths borne of lifelong exposure to violence and the desperation to conform to societal norms. It’s an extraordinary physical performance from Roslyn, cleverly enhanced by Sherry Coenen’s lighting, as the two facets of her self are delineated but also marked as two ends of the same gender-fluid spectrum as opposed to two separate personae. This distinction becomes important later on, as her mental composure begins to crack, inspiring as much fear as compassion with Roslyn’s confrontational direct address leaving us nowhere to turn."
14,14,Ought To Be Clowns,18/03/2019,Ian,Romance Romance, Above the Stag,"Romance Romance was nominated for 5 Tonys in 1988 and performance nods aside, you have to wonder what the standard of the other nominees was (actually, they included The Phantom of the Opera and Into the Woods…!) as its charms really rather eluded me.  Steven Dexter’s production reframes Barry Harman’s book and lyrics into a gay context which certainly has interest. But the disparity of the two acts, based respectively on Arthur Schnitzler’s The Little Comedy and Jules Renard’s Le Pain de Ménage, means it is a curiously disengaging watch. Whether it is the rich Viennese men pretending to be poor or the rich Hamptonites toying with abandoning their marital vows, it’s hard to fall in love with either of these gay love stories. A committed cast – Blair Robertson and Jordan Lee Davies, Alex Lodge and Ryan Anderson – do their best but it’s all a little *shrug emoji*."

16,16,Ought To Be Clowns,29/10/2015,mag9l,The Hairy Ape, Old Vic,"Fans of Bertie Carvel have certainly been rewarded with his recent burst of activity – he starred in Bakkhai at the Almeida, had a major role in BBC drama Doctor Foster and now returns to the theatre to lead this revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Hairy Ape. The play is described as a classic expressionist masterpiece and whilst that might be overstating things ever so slightly, it does give a useful pointer to the heightened theatricality of the drama and of Richard Jones’ production. My 4 star review for Cheap Theatre Tickets can be read here.  "
17,17,Ought To Be Clowns,06/10/2016,mag9l,The Tempest, Donmar at King’s Cross,"A slightly odd one this, the Donmar’s all-female adaptation of The Tempest opened at the King’s Cross Theatre late last month, but from what I can tell won’t be officially reviewed until 22nd November. The reasoning being that it is part of their Shakespeare Trilogy (productions of Julius Caesar from 28th October and Henry IV from 17th November are being remounted) and on select days, audiences can see all three back-to-back. And that is how director Phyllida Lloyd wants them to be critically reviewed, as an over-arching trilogy, which is all fine and good but tickets are either £90 or £120 for those days and I ain’t here for that (that said, if you’re 25 and under, 25% of the tickets are being made free due to this great scheme). So the majority of people seeing The Tempest will only see The Tempest and that’s why I’m writing this review now. For this enterprise, the Donmar has decamped to the King’s Cross Theatre and a well-designed temporary space there (sightlines from the back row – F – are fine and dandy) with the audience seated on all four sides of the theatre. The sense of blank newness is perfectly suited to the institutional setting – Lloyd has returned to the prison set-up that has previously served so well – and retained several members of the ensemble including crucially, the glorious Harriet Walter, who has thrived on the opportunity to expand her already superlative Shakespearean experience. So from Brutus to Henry IV, she now ascends to take on the role of Prospero. Or rather, a lifer who is playing the part of the sorcerer. And you suspect that this is what Lloyd wants emphasise for the critics, the arc of this particular prisoner and the changing dynamic she experiences with her cellmates. With this in mind, Prospero’s confinement on the island and authoritarian relationships with Ariel and Caliban gain a new resonance, the giving up of daughter Miranda representing a different power shift, all making the weariness of soul an aching sadness so easily appreciated. And to hear Walter’s masterful verse-reading crack with emotion through “we are such stuff as dreams are made on” thus becomes the kind of theatrical triumph one will never forget."
18,18,Ought To Be Clowns,03/04/2020,Ian,CASES, The Other Palace,"Written by Dominic Powell and due to star Maiya Quansah-Breed, Sabrina Aloueche, Andrew Patrick-Walker and Adrian Hanse, CASES is a new musical “exploring the triumphs, heartbreaks and sacrifices involved in the pursuit of art, where the commercial world collides with the underground and fame becomes a high price to pay”. It premiered at the Phoenix Arts Club in 2017 but this new production, directed by Grace Taylor, features a new score and new songs and technology being what it is these days, we have a taste of two of them below, which should whet the appetite for when the show is able to resurface.    For Cases

19,19,Ought To Be Clowns,10/07/2013,Ian,Untitled Matriarch Play (Or Seven Sisters), Royal Court,"As we get closer to the end of the weekly rep season, I’d love to be able to say that the over-arching conceit of the whole affair has been revealed in a moment of stunning clarity, but instead it just trundles on as a bold experiment which has had just as many misses as it has had hits. Play number five – Nikole Beckwith’s Untitled Matriarch Play (or Seven Sisters) – was closer to the former than the latter for me – a decent concept but one besmirched by an over-extended, over-worked stab at something interesting that rarely comes off. The play begins in Nowheresville USA with Siobhan Redmond’s Lorraine gathering her ageing mother and her four-strong brood of daughters to reveal that she is going to have another baby, and this time it will be a boy. This comes as something of a surprise as Lorraine is 54, so she is employing a surrogate in the form of Angela Terence’s Sera, but her decision awakens a whole host of dissatisfactions in these women as the situation highlights the frustrations they all hold. And when Beckwith focuses on this, she mainly succeeds. The fractious sibling relationships are a delight to behold – Debbie Chazen’s bumbag-wearing Karen fearing she’s over the hill (at 35) as the oldest, Natasha Gordon’s Mimi the most outwardly self-possessed yet still insecure about so much, and Laura Elphinstone’s Claire a neurotic, typical middle-child, forever ‘not being told anything’. Oh and the always-ignored baby of the family, Farzana Dua Elahe’s Beckah. All single and childless, their mother’s choice forces them to confront the state of their lives and how they all feel out of sorts with each other and the world around them."
20,20,Ought To Be Clowns,07/09/2017,Ian,Mamma Mia, Novello,"18 years since it opened, Mamma Mia continues to tempt people to the island as it now ranks as the seventh-longest running show in the West End. It recently welcomed a new cast into the Novello and I got the opportunity to revisit this stalwart this week (only for the second time actually, here’s my review from 2014). I’ll post a link to my three star review once it gets published."
21,21,Ought To Be Clowns,13/03/2015,mag9l,How I Learned To Drive, Southwark Playhouse,"I’ve always liked Olivia Poulet as an actor but after seeing her starring turn as Li’l Bit in Paula Vogel’s How I Learned To Drive, I’m really rating her now as one not to ignore. It helps that Vogel’s play is supremely well-written, skilfully questioning preconceptions about sexually abusive relationships and their ghastly dynamic through a playful format which manages to layer in humour and pathos to prevent it from being a truly dark night of the soul. It doesn’t mean that this is by any means an easy watch. We see Poulet’s 40-year-old Li’l Bit narrate the experiences of her childhood both as a young girl and as a teenager in a backwoods Maryland town with a great sense of a natural-born raconteur. It’s hard not to be seduced by the stories that roll from her tongue but we soon come to taste the sour beneath the whiskey-heavy breath as the complexity of her relationship with her Uncle Peck slowly comes to light."
22,22,Ought To Be Clowns,20/01/2010,Ian,Silence! The Musical, Above the Stag,"Silence! The Musical is described as ‘the unauthorised parody of The Silence of the Lambs‘ and grew from a collection of songs posted on the internet into an off-Broadway show in 2005. It had a two week run in Baron’s Court last year, but this version at the Above the Stag theatre above a Victoria gay bar is billed as the European professional premiere: it has added new material getting its first airing and retains the original director from New York, Christopher Gatelli. It does what is says on the tin, it’s a relatively faithful rerun of the events of the film where trainee FBI agent Clarice Starling is pressed into interviewing notorious psychiatrist and serial killer Hannibal Lecter in prison in order to help catch another serial killer Buffalo Bill. However, it is mercilessly and hilariously parodied throughout with a book by Hunter Bell and music and lyrics by Jon & Al Kaplan and a chorus of singing and dancing lambs. Incredibly rude in places, with some song titles I dare not mention on here, but oddly enough these weren’t always the funniest parts of the show. It is the attention to detail that had me in stitches for large stretches of the show: the chalk dust signifying the arrival of the dead dad, the pictures in Lecter’s cell, the mask he uses to escape, the little tango kicks in ‘Quid Pro Quo’, all small things but excellently executed and all adding together to great comic effect. It reminded me of the film Airplane in that respect, jam-packed of visual gags as well as clever writing, the scenes with Clarice jogging past other FBI trainees and then walking past prisoners to get to Lecter were both really funny. Key to the success of fringe shows, musicals in particular, is the enthusiasm of the cast, and here there’s no problem whatsoever. Everyone pitches in with a maximum of effort and I loved that everyone appeared as part of the lamb chorus at some point, even the Lecter-playing Miles Western, as creepy a lamb as you will ever see. As the Chianti-supping Doctor, Western is brilliant, suggesting a world of insanity with his eyes and a good clear singing voice, always vital when singing unfamiliar songs. Fabian Hartwell’s Buffalo Bill was also good, even if I wish he hadn’t telegraphed his grand ‘reveal’ quite so much. Tory Ross as Clarice is rightly the star of the show though. Clearly having a ball onstage, she got laughs with practically every line and gesture in a marvellously assured performance, and a great sense of comic timing. It’s hard to pick a favourite moment of hers, but the fat girl joke sequence really was superb. Being a first preview, I’m sure the choreographing of the moving panels will become a lot smoother, but I would recommend a little more incidental music or different flooring as they were often excessively noisy when being repositioned. And a couple of the performers need to adjust their pitching, their voices were too quiet even for this intimate venue. But with six weeks to run, I’m sure everything will settle nicely and this ought to become a good success, it really is as funny as anything in the West End. movies everyone should see – http://www.movieseveryoneshouldsee.com/the-silence-of-the-lambs-1991/"
23,23,Ought To Be Clowns,19/04/2014,mag9l,A Spoonful of Sugar, St James,"Nostalgia can be a lovely thing to bathe in and when it comes to the music of the Sherman Brothers, there’s an ocean of it. Robert and Richard Sherman can lay claim to being one of the most successful songwriting partnerships ever, taking Hollywood by storm with such iconic soundtracks as Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang to name just a few, in a career that has stretched over 60 years, even 90 if one includes their father Al who was a noted songwriter in his own right. To really make it a family affair, A Spoonful of Sherman is hosted by Robert’s son Robbie who acts as compère throughout, drawing the narrative line from the beginning of the twentieth century right up to the present day as of course, he is a composer himself as well. Sadly, Sherman Junior is probably the weakest link of the evening, the unique insight that he could have brought to bear is largely conspicuous by its absence and he feels ill-suited to the task, one can tell this is not his natural oeuvre. Fortunately, the company of four who perform the songs – Emma Williams, Charlotte Wakefield, Stuart Matthew Price and Greg Castiglioni – are eminently at home here in the intimate cabaret surroundings of the St James Studio. Musical director, arranger and pianist on the night Colin Billing completes the set beautifully and it is clear the joy that they all get in working their way through a stunning catalogue of songs. "
24,24,Ought To Be Clowns,27/10/2011,Ian,Earthquakes in London, Richmond Theatre,"My original review can be read here and it was actually quite nice to be able to revisit the show a year later in the context of his other 2010 work Love Love Love and especially in a week when I had also caught Bartlett’s latest epic work 13. Knowing what to expect makes a world of difference: I didn’t feel the length of the show – 2 hours 55 minutes here – whereas people new to it all commented on it; one was able to take in more of the detailed work of the company alongside the razzmatazz which was sometimes a little distracting; and even the final sequence, something that I wasn’t hugely keen on last time, made more sense this time round and felt like the necessary balancing of tone to keep the play from being too despondent. The central conceit of the intertwining stories of the three sisters remained strong and the jumps around time were also effective, possibly more so for knowing exactly what was going on in them from the off! The scale of the storytelling is occasionally unwieldy in reaching to be epic , but I don’t think any other writer in the UK is stretching themselves this much and whilst it may not all come off, I thoroughly admire the scope of his ambition. The staging issues have been addressed by constructing a multi-level revolve to ostensibly allow the multiple short scenes to play out with the necessary speed and energy: this is probably the best (and only?) way this could be achieved although the revolving could have done with being executed with a greater smoothness and speed. And there’s no escaping the fact that performing in a proscenium theatre adds a level of physical distance from the performance which sadly translates into a bit of an emotional disconnect, the raucous energy of the original was something I did miss. In the company of 16, Tracy-Ann Oberman stood out with her excellent performance as oldest sister and coolly pragmatic Sarah, an utterly convincing naturalism to her portrayal which hasn’t necessarily been showcased in her TV work and I thought Sean Gleeson as her husband and John Hollingworth’s Steve also did fine work as did Lucy Phelps, making her debut as gobby youngest sister Jasmine. Joseph Thompson and Paul Shelley portrayed the younger and older version of patriarch Robert well – Shelley gets the best piece of writing, playing off his domestic situation with dour Scottish housekeeper (Maggie McCourt here) to provide a highly illuminating and relatable explanation of the effects of overpopulation. There was a Q and A with Rupert Goold at the end of the show, which was pleasingly free of ridiculous questions (I manage to refrain from asking him what conditioner he uses) that revealed a few tidbits of interesting information. Although already epic in scale, Earthquakes… was originally conceived as a two-part play, and the second part – focusing on Solomon’s journey – might yet still be written; a new Bartlett play will go to the National next year focusing on Queen Elizabeth’s death and Headlong fancy taking Decade out on tour if they can. My favourite snippet though was the revelation that Gary Barlow had declined permission for a Take That song to be used as the dad-rock number – Barlow does strike me as someone who would be that humourless – but I think that Coldplay fit so perfectly into that mould that it was probably for the best. We were also surprised to hear that Bartlett sat in on most of the rehearsals, I don’t doubt that Goold did exactly what he wanted to with the play but I can’t help but wonder what a Bartlett-free rehearsal zone might have felt more at liberty to do with the text."
25,25,Ought To Be Clowns,10/11/2014,Ian,Wildefire, Hampstead,"In what turned out to be my second Maria Aberg production in quick succession, I got something of a crash course in just why people talk about this director so excitedly. Here, she takes Roy Williams’ urban police thriller Wildefire and elides its scenes into a single downwards spiral as policewoman Gail Wilde takes on a South London posting but finds herself unprepared for the intense trials and tribulations of life in the Met. Aberg and Williams do a magnificent job at conjuring a world that is at once innately distrustful of the police yet also guilty of inculcating that distrust. Out of the shadows of James Farncombe’s lighting and the nooks and crannies of Naomi Dawson’s open yet functional design, urban nightmares spill forth whether fighting football fans, council estate domestic abusers or the suffocating menace of disaffected hoodies with nothing to lose. One genuinely disturbing moment sees them at their scavenging worst, demonstrating just what the police are up against sometimes, a near impossible situation for all concerned and agonisingly heartbreaking. But this is no apologia for the boys and girls in blue. Williams starts his play with Sir Robert Peel’s nine principles of policing, designed to underpin the conduct of all police officers in the then new Met force, and proceeds to explore how and if they fit into the modern world. Lorraine Stanley’s Wilde, she of the nickname Wildefire, is a compelling central figure, her good intentions of honouring her grandfather’s own uniformed career soon corrupted by the shift from smalltown policing to the hostility of South London. And as her career suffers from bad decisions, so do does her home life as wife and mother come under strain in a vicious cycle of blame and anger and fear and hate."
26,26,Ought To Be Clowns,31/07/2018,Ian,Sweet Charity, Watermill,"You can never have too much charity it would seem, and as Rebecca Trehearn prepares to take on the role of Charity Hope Valentine in Nottingham next month, Gemma Sutton tackles it here at the beautiful Watermill Theatre in Newbury. Sweet Charity, the 1966 musical by Cy Coleman, Dorothy Fields and Neil Simon is a curious choice for the constant revival it receives. Its sexual politics are askew, its dialogue cheesily dated, and these are issues that Paul Hart’s modernised take has to occasionally battle to address. Setting it in contemporary New York has its pros and cons. Notions of metropolitan isolation and the trials of working in a gig economy are more resonant than ever. But without lyrical updating, ideas of female aspiration remain rooted in the last century – you win some, you lose some. The casting of Sutton (so very good recently in The Rink) is a definite win though, a bright splash of colour in a mostly monochrome world and it is nigh on impossible not to be enchanted by her determination to find love in a cruel world.  The harsh realities of that world are never hidden here, Tom Jackson Greaves’ choreography for the iconic ‘Big Spender’ is mechanic and angular, rather than suggesting the world of dancehall hostesses is glamorously sexualised. And dodging the misogyny where she can, the real support comes from Charity’s co-workers, a deliciously dryly witty Helene from Emma Jane Morton and a spectacularly poised and confident Nickie from Vivien Carter (a breakthrough performance for her, I’m sure of it) – their ‘Baby Dream Your Dream’ is bittersweet perfection. Tom Self’s onstage musical direction of this actor-muso company is thrilling to listen to (almost as much as his lift acting…😉), amping up the dirty brass and grinding bass of Coleman’s evergreen score. And if the funked-up take on ‘The Rhythm of Life’ maybe takes a little getting used to, the fresh approach is no bad thing. So too with Jackson Greaves’ choreography bringing vogueing into the club scenes, it’s all rather fun. And Diego Pitarch’s fine and flexible design is adroitly done, making inventive use of arches on this intimate stage.    Alex Cardall makes for a fascinating Oscar, a scooch younger than usually played and so bringing a different dynamic to the central relationship which occasionally wavers. The final pair of scenes gets it just right though. An inspired ‘history of wedding dance routines’ piece of choreography lift the spirits giddily high after ‘I Love To Cry At Weddings’, the hope that a happy ending might actually be in store for once. And then the gut punch of Oscar’s volte-face lands with punishing power, underscored by a pungent reminder of how all-too-easily society turns its head away from violence against women rather than deal with it head on.  Hart leaves us with the scant solace that there is strength in sisterhood, but also that that strength needs to come from inside. A perfectly judged slow fade to black rightly lends to a ruminative moment of silence before the applause, a welcome reminder that for all the showtunes here, there’s a sadness too that shouldn’t be denied. A bold attempt to move a classic musical into contemporary times. "
27,27,Ought To Be Clowns,18/04/2017,Ian,The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Octagon,"Anne Brontë might not be the most heralded of her sisters but that is to underestimate the different way in which she expressed herself. The striking feminism of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall remains as powerful as ever and in Deborah McAndrew’s adaptation, directed by Elizabeth Newman for the Octagon Theatre in Bolton of which she is the artistic director, it couldn’t find a better place to reassert those feminist credentials. Even in these allegedly more enlightened times, the idea that a woman might stay in an abusive relationship is one that many people struggle with. And so as the story of Helen Graham unfolds, as the events of her past inform what happens in her present, McAndrew’s contemporary dialogue keeps a real modern urgency to the action. Alcoholism and abuse in marriage, gender equality and duty, the struggle for independence – this is timeless stuff."
28,28,Ought To Be Clowns,02/12/2014,Ian,Hope, Royal Court,"The plot for Jack Thorne’s Hope could be lifted from the newspapers right now – a cash-strapped Labour council is faced with impossible choices as austerity continues to bites hard and £22 million has to be trimmed from this year’s budget, £64 million over the next three years. In Newcastle, the figure is actually £90 million despite having already lost £151 million over the last four years, and the decisions about what essential services are to be cut are those that plague Hilary and Mark, the Leader and Deputy Leader respectively, of Thorne’s unspecified local government. Stella Gonet’s Hilary is determined to make it work, a New Labour pragmatism already drawing up the list of priorities – Sure Start centres versus swimming pools, daycare for the disabled versus personal safety in rough areas to give but a couple of examples – but Paul Higgins’ Mark is cut from much more traditional cloth and his protesting colleagues coalesce around him. Eventually, he reluctantly spearheads a rebellion and a refusal to set an amended budget but though this is described as a fable, it is no fairytale, and the consequences of defying government are all too real. Thorne embodies this conflict in Higgins’ anguished, recovering alcoholic Mark – the unpalatability of being responsible for cutting such vital services, but equally the realisation that shirking that accountability through rebellion simply won’t make things better and might actually make things worse. And in expanding on the complexity of his personal life – ex-wife Gina is the manager of the under-threat daycare centre, colleague and sometime squeeze Julie, his precocious teenager of a son Jake – there’s a compelling case for the retreat into inaction that characterised the response of so many to the cuts. Seeing it just before press night, it did feel though that John Tiffany’s production could still use a little tinkering, some cuts of its own perhaps, in the spirit of the play. Tiffany’s stylistic flourishes, as inimitably elegant as they are, serve little purpose other than to make it instantly recognisable as his work. And Tom Scutt’s meticulous town hall set can feel a little cavernous in some of the more intimate scenes, one particular post-coital scene feeling extremely distant when Tiffany’s focus should arguably much tighter and closer."
29,29,Ought To Be Clowns,12/12/2011,Ian,The Songs of My Life – an evening with Peter Polycarpou,,"Peter Polycarpou has had a long and varied career but I will always remember him as Chris Theodopolopoudos from Birds of a Feather, a show I hated yet always seemed to watch when I was younger. So seeing him in a range of roles since I’ve started theatregoing has been a case of rehabilitation of my perception of him and one which I have rather enjoyed. Thus I was quite happy to go along to a one-off concert – The Songs of My Life, an evening with Peter Polycarpou – which celebrated his life and career at the Garrick Theatre this Sunday evening with a range of special guests and choral support from London drama schools. A proud character actor, rather than a leading man, as Polycarpou’s own programme notes start off by saying, the list of shows in which he has actually starred makes really rather impressive reading: Miss Saigon, Oklahoma!, Phantom of the Opera, Les Misérables, Love Story… So as well as being treated with songs from these shows, sometimes with a bit of a twist – I loved being able to hear some of Howard Goodall’s Love Story again, Jos Slovick and Rebecca Trehearn filling in on ‘Phil’s Song/Summer’s Day’, a rousing ‘Bui Doi’ closed the main part of the evening, ‘It’s A Scandal’ received an amusing Cockney makeover and ‘Master of the House’ was transplanted to a Greek taverna to great effect – we also got a set of amusing anecdotes, amassed from a lifetime of experience. Performers often relish the freedom in selecting their own playlist for such shows, meaning they get the chance to sing songs their characters never did. And so Polycarpou gave his ‘Johanna’, from the West End-bound Sweeney Todd, and a quietly moving ‘Empty Chairs at Empty Tables’. Songs from less well known shows and some that he just wanted the opportunity to sing were also featured. The title track from Imagine This was something lovely (and made me want to track down the soundtrack) backed by, as he was at many times through the night, a choir made up of Mountview and Arts Ed students; The Producers’ ‘King of Broadway’ was a tightly choreographed delight, and ‘Lost in the Stars’, from a Kurt Weill musical of the same name stood out too. There were also a few forays into pop/soul numbers which I wasn’t so keen on like ‘Heaven Help Us All’ and ‘Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me’, Peter’s sister Eve Polycarpou giving us a rendition of ‘The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face’ here too, but the Randy Newman material worked well. But even in a show celebrating his own career, Polycarpou shared the limelight generously, allowing moments for his guests to really shine too. Hannah Waddingham brought the house down with an impassioned rendition of Ragtime’s ‘Back To Before’, following a romp through ‘The Song That Goes Like This’ with the leading man; Simon Bowman gave us ‘Music of the Night’, Stuart Matthew Price duetted on his own ‘Stories for Heroes’ and Claire Moore and Rebecca Trehearn combined to great effect on Miss Saigon’s ‘I Still Believe’. And reinforcing his strong teaching work, he gave over the spotlight to two upcoming talents: Valjean-in-the-making Samuel Nunn and Tyrone Huntley who both impressed. There were the usual issues with events such as these: Michelle Collins, scheduled to duet on ‘Baby It’s Cold Outside’, was a last minute dropout; and there was some extremely wayward sound design issues which remained a problem, though not huge, for most of the evening. But altogether it was a lovely evening that paid great tribute to a varied performer who perhaps deserves more credit than he currently gets. The final ensemble rendition of ‘Seasons of Love’ was a brilliant way to end the evening, Waddingham giving it her best vamping, but a final encore of Irving Berlin’s ‘What’ll I Do’ – a perfect nod to his televisual past – showed real class.    "
30,30,Ought To Be Clowns,14/08/2011,Ian,On The Record, Arcola,"iceandfire are a theatre company dedicated to exploring stories about the struggle for human rights through performance. Their latest work, which has now just closed at the Arcola, was On the Record by Christine Bacon and Noah Birksted-Breem, a mixture of verbatim work and theatrical reconstructions following the stories of six investigative journalists battling to expose their horrific stories from across the globe. Their reports are first given under the pretext of a conference on press freedom, indicating the importance of reporting free from undue influence, to tell the stories we might not want to hear but which we simply must. Then from Sri Lanka to Iraq, Mexico to Russia and the Middle East, we see each of them at work, risking their lives in a multitude of ways from a multitude of enemies. Caught in a hazy place between genuine theatre and a kind of reportage, the show was never less than gripping in its unflinching portrayal of some of the horrors that are perpetrated in this world of ours and the corruption that lies behind it. The ensemble playing, the six actors all cover several small roles as well as one key part each, ensures a lightness of touch which keeps things from becoming too bogged down in worthiness. There is though a slight lack of balance that emerges too, the roles of the journalist are beyond question, beyond reproach, this lack of interrogation of both sides detracts a little from the bigger picture, though this was a thought that only came to be in the bar later – it didn’t affect the actual show."
31,31,Ought To Be Clowns,12/11/2009,Ian,The Habit of Art, National,"The premise of this play is around an imagined meeting between old friends Benjamin Britten (Alex Jennings) and W.H. Auden (Richard Griffiths taking over from Gambon) as Britten is seeking advice and reassurance about his new opera, Death in Venice. However, this is not all Bennett wants to talk about, so he uses the framing device of us being backstage at a theatre watching the rehearsal of a new play about this meeting, as witnessed by Humphrey Carpenter (Adrian Scarborough), a man who was later to write biographies about both of them. Thus the stage is set for an examination of the creative process of collaboration, whether between these two legendary figures or between the acting company representing them. This set up allows Bennett to insert much of his trademark humour, especially with Frances De La Tour’s long-suffering stage manager (the look on her face as she begins “I am a mirror…” is one of the funniest things I’ve seen in a long time), as we witness the company at work, dissecting the play whilst rehearsing it, debating the writing with the author, questioning the actions of the characters, and generally hamming it up. There was a moment of magic for me about two thirds of the way through the first half, when all of this fannying about is dropped, and we witness the reunion of Britten and Auden, and the scene is just played straight: Griffiths and Jennings captivated me entirely in this scene and I felt the whole play coming together, and when they broke for their interval (and indeed our interval), I desperately wanted them to continue. Unfortunately, the play never recaptured this intensity of feeling for me, as the scenes in the second half were regularly interrupted with the actors slipping in and out of character and joking, which was a shame as I felt it kept the audience at arms length from what I had thought would be the key emotional relationship of the piece. Instead of looking at the collaboration around art, Bennett is much more preoccupied with analysing Auden’s and Britten’s homosexuality and the effect this had on their work. The result is something which ends up feeling quite fitting into Bennett’s oeuvre, but yet ultimately not wholly engaging as nothing new is uncovered and what we do know is simply reiterated, for example Britten’s predilections for younger boys is touched on but not examined. Alex Jennings in particular deserves praise for his excellent portrayal of Britten and Henry the actor playing him, and whilst Richard Griffiths was by no means bad, but I did rather feel I had seen much of this performance elsewhere, there wasn’t much new brought to the table though he wasn’t helped by playing such an irascible character. The wider discussion around the nature of reputations and theatre suffered the same fate since we had no emotional engagement, the final speech in particular being insufferably self-referential. Adrian Scarborough is criminally underused here: what he does have he uses very well, but there is no depth to his character which given Carpenter’s actual exploits seems a little harsh. I was pleased to see John Heffernan onstage again, after loving him in Carrie’s War, and his scenes with Frances De La Tour as the talking props and words and music were excellently executed. And I also enjoyed the sharply suited Elliott Levey as the play’s author, even if it does feel like he pops up in a large proportion of the National Theatre’s productions!
One mildly annoying factor for me was the audience’s eagerness to laugh loudly at every single hint of a funny line. For sure, the writing in the first half was largely amusing, but it was mainly chucklesome, yet people were practically rolling in the aisles: one gets the feeling you could have just said “Alan Bennett” and they’d’ve been laughing their heads off…"
32,32,Ought To Be Clowns,15/03/2013,Ian,The Living Room, Jermyn Street,"Celebrating its 60th anniversary this year, Graham Greene’s first play The Living Room hasn’t been revived in the UK since opening in 1953 so Primavera’s revival for the Jermyn Street Theatre offers a rare chance to experience Greene the playwright. After the death of her mother, 20 year old Rose Pemberton is taken to live with her deeply Catholic elderly uncle and aunts by a 45 year old friend of her long-dead father, a married psychology professor named Michael. An illicit affair has started between the pair which throws them into direct conflict with the traditional views of her new household and the repercussions of the actions of all concerned result in catastrophic consequences. At the heart of the story is the newly orphaned Rose, an accomplished stage debut from Tuppence Middleton with a lovely blend of cut-glass properness and spirited rebelliousness as she strains against society’s conventions in the single-minded pursuit of her ill-starred affair yet not so devoid of emotion that she disregards her only remaining family completely. Christopher Villiers as the professor feels a little miscast as he never really brings to bear any sense of what it is that might have ensnared Rose’s affections so, but his attempts to rationalise the behaviour around him and justify his own using the psychology he teaches have a pugnacious persuasiveness.  Where the show really excels though is in showing the world that Rose is so stifled and horrified by. Cherry Truluck’s design of claustrophobic and faded domesticity sits perfectly in the intimacy of the Jermyn Street Theatre and occupied by the ageing siblings, it perfectly represents the stultifying environment she cannot bear to be trapped in. In a morbid twist, after the death of any member of the household, their room is closed off permanently and so the sense of this being a dying breed is keenly felt, the name of the titular living room gaining greater significance. Christopher Timothy is perhaps a little too placid as the overly symbolic Father James, trapped in a wheelchair for 20 years and slowly losing his faith, but there is exemplary work from the two actresses playing his sisters. Diane Fletcher’s Aunt Helen captures the right note of corrosive fundamentalism that burns as much as it blesses and Caroline Blakiston is most affecting as the frailer Aunt Teresa, fragile but wise and altogether a stunning performance."

34,34,Ought To Be Clowns,15/10/2012,Ian,Desire Under The Elms, Lyric Hammersmith,"It’s been a slow but increasingly steady journey into the world of Eugene O’Neill for me: since 2010’s Beyond The Horizon, high profile productions of Anna Christie and Long Day’s Journey Into Night confirmed his reputation was indeed well earned (I do like to be able to make up my own mind on such things, I hate being told “so and so is the greatest playwright” and being expected just to accept it). And after The Hairy Ape at the Southwark Playhouse, it is now the turn of the Lyric Hammersmith to get in on the action with Sean Holmes’ production of his 1924 play Desire Under The Elms.  Drawing heavily from Greek tragedy and in particular the tale of Phaedra, O’Neill locates his story in 19th century New England but mines a similar vein of earth-shattering catastrophe. Son of his father’s second wife, Eben is determined to secure the family farm for his inheritance. He pays off his two older half-brothers as they depart for the Gold Rush, but his father Ephraim is a randy old goat and marries for the third time, scuppering Eben’s plan as his new young wife Abbie stakes her own claim. But matters are further problematized by an illicit attraction between son and stepmother and when Abbie falls pregnant…well, do you think there’ll be a happy ending? Predictably, it is a punishingly bleak play. Twanging guitar music is played live throughout and Ian McNeil’s intricately designed set combines with some evocative sound and lighting work from James Farncombe and Christopher Shutt respectively to set the dark mood of swirling emotion that dominates the latter two thirds of the play. It takes a while to get there though, the opening section with the brothers is an odd way to set up the story and doesn’t quite feel as connected as it could to the play as a whole.  It comes alive though with Denise Gough’s fierce performance as Abbie, a complex force of nature to be reckoned with, blazing a trail across the family homestead, whether with Finbar Lynch’s commanding pater-familias Ephraim (a slightly odd casting choice as the character is much older than Lynch) or Morgan Watkins’ lust-ridden Eben. And the spiral down to the deeply tragic conclusion that leaves everyone shattered is powerfully drawn in Holmes’ production. "
35,35,Ought To Be Clowns,09/07/2011,Ian,Park Avenue Cat, Arts Theatre,"‘When does a twosome become a threesome?’ Twosome?! Reading the promotional blurb for Park Avenue Cat set alarm bells ringing before the show had even started at the Arts Theatre but I was determined to give this a go as it is starring Josefina Gabrielle. One of the happiest moments of my theatregoing year so far was in her arrival onstage in Me and My Girl as I had completely forgotten she was in the cast and she was just phenomenal, as indeed she had been in Sweet Charity and Hello, Dolly! : this marking the first time I’ve seen her in straight drama. Quite why she chose this, written by Los Angeles-based scribe Frank Strausser who apparently has fingers in films and books as well as theatre, we will never know as it is completely undeserving of her talents. The show centres on Gabrielle’s character Lily, a forty-something art dealer who has summoned her boyfriend Philip to couples therapy as she is getting frustrated with the lack of progress in their relationship. When he predictably doesn’t turn up, her lover Dorian sneakily takes his place in the session, leaving the therapist struggling to deal with Lily’s emotional crises and the confusion wrought by Dorian’s appearance, especially as he is one of her exes as well. A later session, after catching glimpses of Lily with both her lovers, ramps up the farcical comedy as both men turn up for the session with her and the therapist forces Lily to confront just what it is that she wants. It could have been good but Strausser’s writing shows no discernible comic aptitude or insight into any of the issues around therapy or relationships that it raises. Most crucially, he has little empathetic understanding of the dilemma faced by women struggling to balance society’s expectations of becoming a wife and mother with the individual desires that each have. Instead he retreats to the easy laughs generated by making Lily a gold-digging girl-about-town used to the high life (which I think is what is meant by the term Park Avenue Cat though it is never clarified) and Gabrielle has to try her damnedest to try and rise above this casual misogynist viewpoint to make a living, breathing, likeable woman out of Lily: she almost gets there. Daniel Weyman as Dorian and Gray O’Brien as Philip, the two men in her life, are both amiable enough – Weyman’s physicality is great and O’Brien’s swaggering presence sorely underused – but they’re given completely paper-thin characters and again, struggle to rise above the sheer fatuousness of the material. Matters are not helped by some dodgy directorial choices too. Tessa Peake-Jones’ therapist is constantly on the phone to troublesome clients in whom we have no interest yet who keep reappearing, dragging out the action and forcing Peake-Jones into some very strained extemporising. The dives into exaggerated stage fighting are frankly embarrassing and unnecessary, seeking a comedic tone that isn’t present in the writing. And the final scene sees some utterly pointless wandering on and off stage as Lily and Philip have a massive argument whilst waiting for the lift to come by the unconventional method of walking up and down a corridor. It is both ridiculous and distracting. Mark Walters’ design initially looks impressive, especially for a theatre like the Arts, two mini revolves allowing for three completely distinct locations to be created. But it just doesn’t look professional: the joins are far too visible, sections failed to click in smoothly and it’s all done at a laborious pace: the only bits that moved quickly were the bits being yanked into place by stagehands. The music that covers these long changes is pleasant enough but the patience is stretched extremely thin. Ultimately, I found little to commend Park Avenue Cat and found it to be a disappointing waste of some great acting talent who are given so very little to work with. That it is also being adapted for film is something that doesn’t surprise me but is extremely depressing. The best thing I can say about the show is that for once, the image used to promote the show is accurate and Josefina Gabrielle wears that red dress throughout the final scene (see Anne-Marie Duff and the Cause Célèbre poster)."
36,36,Ought To Be Clowns,27/03/2019,Ian,Company, Gielgud Theatre,"I went back, again. Well I had to, at least while the above quote is still true for me for a couple more months. There’s not much left to say about Company that I haven’t said already here, or here, or here and it remains an absolute pleasure to watch, a show I could sit through time and time again even more so than I have already. It will be very much missed."
37,37,Ought To Be Clowns,17/04/2015,mag9l,The Pirates of Penzance, Richmond Theatre,"Gilbert and Sullivan’s titular buccaneers may struggle with a lack of a ruthless edge but Sasha Regan’s sharp eye means that piracy definitely pays as her all-male interpretation of The Pirates of Penzance enters a fifth year of swashbuckling success. From its initial run at the Union Theatre in 2009 and subsequent transfer to Wilton’s Music Hall, it has toured Australia, played the Hackney Empire and now returns for a UK tour which runs through to the end of June. And getting to gaily tread the measure one more time was indeed an especial pleasure once again. In the august surroundings of Richmond’s Victorian theatre, the set design may look a little spare but once the stage is filled with heaving bodies – whether preening with piratical glee, gambolling in corsets or patrolling a policeman’s lot, or indeed all three at the same time, the musical spectacle of these eighteen lads, plus pianist, is quite something to behold. From Neil Moors’ strapping Pirate King to Alex Weatherhill’s long-suffering Ruth, Samuel Nunn’s walking paradox Frederic to Alan Richardson’s would-be coquettish Mabel, it’s hard not to tumble hard for their collective charms and though the emphasis may be more on the comic side, there’s still real emotion that comes from Weatherhill’s impassioned pleas in ‘Oh! False One…’ and Richardson’s fetching falsetto. Dale Page, Chris Theo-Cook, Richard Russell Edwards and Ben Irish make a bonny bevy of frisky sisters too, never protesting too much at the sudden arrival of so many men. Regan’s production revels in the comic detailing though – the policeman’s moustaches, the Major-General’s horse, the response to “homely face”, petticoat hoops going awry, there’s not an opportunity for a gag wasted anywhere. Lizzi Gee’s choreography has an infectious humour about it and I was pleased to see that the aisles are still used to allow maidens to climb their rocky mountains and policemen to use their cat-like tread well before they hit the stage. Well worth walking the plank for. "
38,38,Ought To Be Clowns,25/09/2009,Ian,Prick Up Your Ears, Comedy,"The action here takes place solely in the Islington apartment that Orton and Halliwell shared, with occasional interjections from their landlady Mrs Corden. Bent’s take on the story is that as Orton’s star rose he was more than ably helped by Halliwell, indeed his success was dependent on him, and that formed the crux of their relationship, giving extra meaning to Halliwell’s subsequent depression and Orton’s treatment of him. I’m not sure that this interpretation worked for me and to be honest, I remain to be convinced. Matt Lucas has a difficult job here in managing the balancing act of rehabilitating Halliwell’s character, given the well-known bloody ending to the story. There are shades of previous performances in his comedic earlier scenes, but given the sheer number of characters covered in his shows, this is perhaps inevitable and did not really detract from the show here. I felt Lucas was ironically much better at portraying the darker shades of Halliwell psyche, his descent into madness is convincingly played, but I did end up feeling a little uneasy about how the audience was being asked to feel sorry for a murderer which was how I felt the show was leading me. As Joe Orton, Chris New is excellent. His performance exudes a great physicality and sexuality which goes a long to explaining th hold Orton had over Halliwell, and he did a great job in showing the increasing disillusionment felt towards his partner. Gwen Taylor as the landlady Mrs Corder has most of the funny lines of the play, but her quality shines over and above the writing as her comic timing is pure class: she is mercilessly funny with her every word and movement and basically steals every scene she is in."
39,39,Ought To Be Clowns,21/08/2012,Ian,Barrow Hill, Finborough,"Barrow Hill is Jane Wainwright’s debut play, set in her native Derbyshire. 86 year old Kath Bilby is determined to save her local Methodist Chapel from being converted into flats as her family ties to the place are numerous and considerable. But when she finds it is her own son Graham, seeing an opportunity to address financial difficulties, who has won the building contract, both mother and son are forced to deal with their divided allegiances in this delicately moving tale at the Finborough. Wainwright presents the idea of family loyalty and community as a double-edged sword. The succour that Kath finds from the wealth of family history and intimate familiarity around her is contrasted with the stifled ambition of grand-daughter Alison, itching to explore life beyond Derbyshire though keenly aware of how tightly the family bonds are felt. There’s a subtle grace to much of the writing here, Janet Henfrey’s determined feistiness convinced of her path of action and filling the void in a life where so many of her friends have died, and Cath Whitefield’s brusque wit just about hiding the more sensitive soul longing to come out. But the play never quite kicks out of this understated gear. Wainwright doesn’t lend the central conflict between Kath and Graham the requisite teeth to make it compelling and Abbey Wright’s direction similarly doesn’t inject sufficient energy into the scenes that need it, in order to make this a story in which all the elements are as persuasive as each other. Charlie Roe thus struggles to make Graham a truly sympathetic character and so convince us of the gravity of his dilemma, and Mark Weinman is saddled with the rather under-developed Lucasz, too peripheral a character in an already slight piece."
40,40,Ought To Be Clowns,15/03/2020,Ian,N89, Matchstick Piehouse,"It takes a hell of a lot to get me on the top deck of a nightbus, an instinctive self-preservation tending to kick in from the lairiness often within, but Mark Daniels’ N89 suggests that I might be missing out on a real slice of life up there, along with the potential for some unexpected connections.  Right from the off, Daniels nails the emotional balancing act of using public transport – the annoyance of someone right sitting next to you when there’s other free seats, the horror of being fallen asleep on or even worse, spoken to. But when Kim plants herself next to Danny on the long schlep from Trafalgar Square to Erith, a different kind of journey emerges for them.  As casual conversation flirts with, well, a bit of flirting, Kim and Daniel also have to engage with a rolling crew of larger than life characters as the bus rolls through Peckham, Lewisham and beyond. And here, N89 really is deliciously funny as it explores the delights of eavesdropping on the conversations nearby – the shags gone awry, the couples gossiping closely, the drunk loudmouths who are funny until they launch on you… Edwina Strobl’s smoothly flowing direction also allows for dips into more introspective territory – dealing with overt racism, the gentrification of certain neighbourhoods, whether differences in class are as real as all that. Grace Boyle and Ocean Harris keep you thoroughly invested in the journey and the rest of the company multi-roll most effectively, Natasha Vasandani stands out in particular with some vivid and diverse characterisations."
41,41,Ought To Be Clowns,24/02/2019,Ian,And The Rest of Me Floats, Bush Theatre,"Outbox Theatre’s And The Rest of Me Floats soars in its opening and closing moments. There’s not a word spoken for the first few minutes but as the company of trans, non-binary, and queer performers take their seats one by one on the stage of the Bush Theatre – full of unflinching direct eye contact with the audience – there’s such a powerful statement of intent about their unalienable right to take over this space. And as the show winds to its climax just over an hour later, this already most unconventional of shows opens out into something of a game of ‘Never Have I Ever’ as performers and audience members alike are encouraged to share something of themselves. It’s a beautifully intimate and inclusive act, topped off with a raucous singalong to MUNA’s anthemic ‘I Know A Place’ – how my queer little heart filled with joy. Inbetween, the company of seven investigate “the messy business of gender” as best they know how. Deeply personal anecdotes mix with renditions of pop songs, striking movement sequences dance around spoken word interludes, as they articulate something of what it means to fuck with society’s preconceived notions about gender, in the name of expressing their true selves.  As a devised work under Ben Buratta’s direction, it is perhaps a little chaotic but the roughness around the edges feels entirely appropriate for the queer house party vibe that Rūta Irbīte’s design executes so well. And as Yasmin Zadeh shares photos from their childhood that gives the lie to the nature vs nurture debate, as Tamir Amar Pettet flings their frame frustratedly against plastic barriers, as glitter falls as easily as tears, it is impossible to resist the generosity of spirit on display here in telling these stories that so badly need to be more widely heard and understood."
42,42,Ought To Be Clowns,15/03/2018,Ian,Lock and Key, VAULT Festival,"A nippy little thing this,  Lock and Key. A new musical from writing duo Barlow & Smith, a couple of cracking musical theatre actresses in Tiffany Graves and Evelyn Hoskins, and the sweaty intimacy of the Pit, one of the VAULT Festival’s less hospitable spaces. It all adds up to something really rather entertaining. Set in the children’s literature department of a publishing firm, office junior Jess is doing everything she can to impress boss Samantha as the end of her probationary period fast approaches. She’s even missing her birthday party in order to seize a key opportunity but she soon finds out that that is not all she will have to sacrifice to make it to the top.  Billed as a workplace thriller, Adam Lenson’s production flirts with B-movie horror as something of an enjoyable schlockfest emerges. Talking teddy bears and outright gore sit alongside an exploration of modern office culture in AC Smith’s book, which pulls no punches in exposing the hollowness ingrained in much of what is measured as ‘success’."
43,43,Ought To Be Clowns,27/11/2011,Ian,Cock, Radio 3,"I don’t listen to the radio much at all, but when Twitter notified me of the broadcasting of Mike Bartlett’s play Cock on Radio 3, with the original cast intact, I decided to make an exception. It was a play that I very much enjoyed when I saw it at the Royal Court Upstairs back in December 2009 and Bartlett has emerged as one of my favourite new writers, especially when he is focusing on the sharp intimate edges of human relationships. Cock focuses on John’s difficulties when he realises how fluid his sexuality is. During a rough patch with his boyfriend, he has a random hook-up with a woman he has seen before on his daily commute and his eyes are opened to a whole world of new possibilities. But as he decides what, and who, he wants, the pressure from the others to make a choice increases. 
The radio programme started with a nice little introduction about the writing of the play from Bartlett, talking about how he started in a cafe in the gay district of Mexico City and let his characters take on lives of their own before shaping them into a narrative. And listening to the show reminded me of so much of what was good about it: Andrew Scott’s amazing range of intense emotion and usage of the word ‘fuck-puppetry’ and Katherine Parkinson’s razor-sharp characterisation of a woman determined not to let go."
44,44,Ought To Be Clowns,28/11/2013,Ian,Jumpers for Goalposts, Bush,"A third visit to this play for me – Jumpers for Goalposts may have just opened at the Bush Theatre this week but this Paines Plough, Hull Truck and Watford Palace Theatre production premiered earlier this year in Watford where it utterly stole my heart and tempted me back for seconds despite the short run. Since then it has toured the UK and now ends up in the West London venue where writer Tom Wells had such success a couple of years ago with The Kitchen Sink. And in those intervening months, assisted by the intimacy of the Bush, the play has grown into something even better, even more affecting in its charming lo-fi way. My original review says much of what I still think of the play, but I don’t think one can understate the importance of this piece of writing. The trials and tribulations of Barely Athletic, the five-a-side football team at the heart of the play are strongly, vividly portrayed, but as entirely recognisable experiences that might befall you or I. And as three of the five happen to be gay men, it holds a particular resonance for me – has a playwright ever evoked the reality of the aftermath of being gay-bashed so effectively, the mundanity of actually just having to get on with everyday life rather than focusing on the intense drama of the crime itself. And likewise with the central love story. Though it is a homosexual one, the feelings of bashful awkwardness, intense longing and the sheer delight of the possibility of it maybe being reciprocated is something that is applicable to anyone, whether a Cornish B&B owner, a thoughtless X-Factor winner or any Russian bureaucrat. And the fact that they are gay genuinely is irrelevant on so many levels, yet vital in trying to normalise depictions of LGBT life. Jamie Samuel and Philip Duguid-McQuillan as the smitten Danny and Luke are delightful and with Andy Rush’s Geoff, create a wonderfully unaffected vibe to James Grieve’s production."
45,45,Ought To Be Clowns,09/03/2011,Ian,Mogadishu, Lyric Hammersmith,"Mogadishu is a new play by Vivienne Franzmann which was one of four winners of the Bruntwood Prize, a playwriting competition. It premiered at the Royal Exchange in Manchester, where it received the royal seal of approval from my Mum and Dad and Aunty Jean but it has now transferred to the Lyric Hammersmith. White liberal teacher Amanda intervenes in a playground fight when she sees known troublemaker Jason bullying a younger pupil at their inner-city London secondary school but finds herself pushed and shoved to the ground in the ensuing fracas. She is anxious not to see him punished though, conscious of the social consequences for uneducated young black men, but when he flips the table and accuses her of physical and racial abuse, the security of Amanda’s world is shattered with her fitness to be a teacher, even a mother, called into question. Julia Ford plays Amanda with a powerful dignity, well-intentioned to the end no matter what the cost and her scenes with Ian Bartholomew’s acting headteacher Chris, hamstrung by a world of bureaucracy, child protection legislation and the desire to be seen to be ‘doing the right thing’ ring with a depressing honesty. Shannon Tarbet as her daughter, and also a pupil at the same school, stole the show for me with a stunning intensity as she deals with her own issues and rages at the passivity of her mother. Franzmann’s greatest strength has been to capture the voice of teenage schoolyards so effectively as shown in a well-crafted opening scene which pulls us right into this intense and energetic world and it is expertly played by the teenage ensemble in Tom Scutt’s wire-mesh cage design. She also explores the complexities of teenage social relationships well in the way Jason is able to coerce his gang to corroborate his version of events through an uneasy mix of playing on his friendships, sexual charisma and a healthy dose of fear, Malachi Kirby’s menacing physical presence matched by a brutal manipulative streak. There’s a pleasing depth to some of these supporting characters too: Savannah Gordon-Liburd’s Dee is the most intelligent of the group and clearly uneasy with events but even she is not above unleashing venomous threats against a potential whistle-blower and I really enjoyed Farshid Rokey’s mouthy Saif, struggling under pressure from his Muslim family. But no matter how well-drawn and convincing this group is, as the show loses its way slightly towards the end, there’s an over-reliance on the wise-cracking and posing which too often arrests the dramatic flow, meaning a couple of performances never escape the one note which grated on me a little, to be honest. And the way in which the story is pulled together at the end with a neatness which belies the messiness and the ongoing nature of the issues that are raised ends up feeling a little contrived which is a shame given the strength of what has gone before."
46,46,Ought To Be Clowns,03/11/2017,Ian,Wings, Young Vic,
47,47,Ought To Be Clowns,03/10/2014,Ian,Pitcairn, Shakespeare’s Globe,"It may be Shakespeare’s Globe but it is Richard Bean’s when it comes to new writing at this venue and he returns once again with a Globe, Out of Joint and Chichester Festival Theatre co-production about the island colony of Pitcairn which was set up by Fletcher Christian in the wake of the mutiny on the Bounty in 1789. Playing with the ideas of revolutionary freedom that were burning so fiercely on the other side of the globe, Christian dreamed of creating an Utopian ideal out of the sailors who left with him and a group of Polynesian men and women but perhaps unsurprisingly, little that was ideal came out of it. Little that is ideal comes out of this play either. Bean throws in a number of interesting ideas into his Pitcairn – the power struggles between comrades, the jealousies that come out of the supposed liberation of sexual freedom, the culture clash that arises out of the enduring adherence to the Tahitian tradition of utmost respect for hierarchy. But it all adds up to very little and Bean has also incorporated some dodgier elements especially when it comes to the cringe-worthy expression of that sexual freedom, the constant reliance of embarrassingly dated notions of the ‘natives’ (let’s dance!) and audience participation that doesn’t really fly."
48,48,Ought To Be Clowns,05/05/2018,Ian,Quiz, Noël Coward,"It’s taken me a little while to get around to seeing James Graham’s Quiz but it proved more than worth it as this particular matinée was undoubtedly enhanced by the West End debut of…me and my Aunty Jean! Treading the boards of the Noël Coward Theatre was an unexpected bonus to a highly enjoyable afternoon, and I look forward to the next role that Mr Graham creates for me… But back to the matter at hand. Transferring over from Chichester, Quiz takes a cock-eyed look at the world of light entertainment, and the way in which ‘constructed reality’ has bled into the larger narrative not just of our television, but of our society. Using the ‘coughing major’ scandal of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire as a jump-off point, we dive into meaty notions of truth and justice in a media-dominated age.  Visually inventive, formally a little daring, and fascinating from start to finish, I was entirely seduced by Quiz, and not just because I got to be a Bullseye contestant onstage. Probing into the UK’s predilection for a quizshow, indulging that with its own pub quiz and opportunities to vote on whether people are guilty or not, whilst openly manipulating us in terms of formulating a narrative for us to follow, the show’s construction is ingenious."
49,49,Ought To Be Clowns,03/05/2016,mag9l,The Iphigenia Quartet, Gate Theatre,"And still the Greeks come. The Gate Theatre have taken Euripides’ Iphigenia at Aulis and asked four playwrights to react to it with short plays from varying viewpoints, giving us The Iphigenia Quartet. Split into two double bills, we thus get Caroline Bird’s Agamemnon and Lulu Raczka’s Clytemnestra, and Suhayla El-Bushra’s Iphigenia and Chris Thorpe’s Chorus, two strong pairings that crack open the Greek tragedy and offer a kaleidoscope of responses. Such is the enduring resilience of the original that it can take diverse treatments – to wit, the trio of Oresteias that graced British stages last year – and packed into this studio intimacy and seen on the same day (as I saw them) or not, the impact is visceral and considerable. From the raw anguish of Bird’s duelling parents to Raczka’s academic debate spun on its head, from El-Bushra’s family of Marines to Thorpe’s babbling chorus of commenters, the shifting focus is at once enigmatic and entertaining.  As one would expect, each writer tackles Euripides differently on the wide ceremonial dais of Cécile Trémolières’ design but it is interesting to see the commonalities that emerge. Bird and El-Bushra both make reference to Agamemnon’s prior slaughter of Clytemnestra’s first husband and son to remind us of the ruthlessness of the House of Atreus no matter the regret later shown. And Raczka and Thorpe both explore how historical legacies are shaped or indeed warped by perspective.  Consequently it feels as much a Clytemnestra quartet as it does an Iphigenia one, her experience both dramatically and dramaturgically being the most fascinating and under-explored. As acted out by Sharon Duncan-Brewster with utter fierceness or reacted to by Susie Trayling’s thoughtful academic, it’s to her we keep getting drawn. The one exception (of sorts) is Thorpe’s Chorus, which manages to speak volumes about society’s ever-more entitled predilection for spouting opinionated rubbish. Speaking of which…more detailed reviews of each show can be found below 😉 If I had to pick one of the two parts for you to go to, I’d probably opt for Agamemnon and Clytemnestra though Chorus was probably my single favourite short play but spoil yourself, why not see both and be reminded of why we keep coming back to Greek tragedies and exactly how much they can still teach us today.   Previously at this theatre with her take on The Trojan Women, Caroline Bird’s Agamemnon (or The Restless Troops) gives us a resolutely modern, human take on this hero, opening with him drunk on cheap wine, adrift on the horns of the dilemma of the divine sacrifice required of him. But where the personal and political have become one for him. Bird gives the 10,000 soldiers he commands – those whose choice has already been made – a voice in the form of Louise McMenemy’s unflinching Messenger. So lest we feel too sorry for Andrew French’s deeply conflicted Agamemnon, his torment is presented as self-pitying in the eyes of those who have already sacrificed so much. And by the time, Sharon Duncan-Brewster’s wig-snatching Clytemnestra unleashes all her impotent fury (and what scorching fury it is too, she is superb) at the realisation that her husband has chosen to be a politician rather than a parent – “I’m a good man in a dreadful situation” – the betrayal just as keenly felt as ever.  Bird’s vividly poetic prose conjures arresting imagery of “acorn-coloured men” and scoops of porridge “like cellulite” as well as conveying the almost brain-washed mindset of the military. And Chris Haydon’s direction shows a delicious appreciation of the potential of this space of which he is Artistic Director. The way he moves his quartet of actors has the precision of van Hove’s chessboard moves and without giving too much away, the flourish of the finale with Josh Pharo’s lighting is a real theatrical thrill. Clytemnestra 
Lulu Raczka’s Clytemnestra is perhaps formally the most interesting of the quartet, splicing together a film director (Anthony Barclay) and a Greek Tragedy lecturer’s (Susie Trayling) approaches to the play and then intertwining that with a similarly combined narrative from one of Clytemnestra’s maids and a returning Greek soldier. Director Jennifer Tang controls this torrent of words skilfully as both cultural and first-hand perceptions of Clytemnestra are put forth and then challenged. Given the power of Duncan-Brewster’s portrayal of the character just moments before, it’s a boldly alternative take but one which gathers real power in the telling. Tremors of Elena Peña’s sound queer the pitch beautifully as the focus switches this way and that and as their stories become more personal (Trayling and Barclay are both superb in this respect), you realise just how striking an exploration of Clytemnestra’s legacy this is, without her even appearing onstage. Iphigenia
Suhayla El-Bushra’s Iphigenia, Scourge of Troy (aka Why Should I Die Cheap?) probably felt the weakest of the quartet for me. Interestingly, this was the only part to give a voice to Iphigenia (and to Achilles, her pseudo-betrothed too) but even then, the focus still pulled out to her parents too often for my liking, its modern specificity working against it too – Agamemnon as a Marine in thrall to the gods didn’t convince.  Rebecca Hill’s direction struggled to gather together its scattered parts even across the short running time, too jerky and disjointed for this model of storytelling. And even if Shannon Tarbet is ideal casting as an obstreperous Iphigenia, refusing to eat her dinner and spearing a satsuma on the wall-mounted antlers, again the writing didn’t quite do her justice in the final analysis. Chorus 
Directed by Elayce Ismail, Chris Thorpe’s Chorus really is the bee knees. Teasing out the role of the Chorus by comparing it directly to the globally connected society of which we’re all a part, Thorpe goes in hard on those who love to express an opinion, reiterate that opinion, shout down anyone who disagrees with that opinion, denigrate those who would stop them from having an opinion by, for example, not showing them live footage of a murder – “we wanted injustice done so we could watch it”."
50,50,Ought To Be Clowns,06/02/2012,Ian,Gay’s the Word, Finborough,"The Finborough Theatre has long been well regarded as a powerhouse of intimate (not small!) theatre, developing a strong reputation on two fronts with its rediscoveries of old plays and in the promotion of new writing. But though the space above the rather lovely wine bar is petite, their productions never are and this revival of Ivor Novello’s Gay’s the Word, on for just six performances (now extended by two), features a cast of 19. Last year’s Perchance to Dream, another of Novello’s neglected works, was a genuine pleasure to watch – introducing me to the song ‘We’ll Gather Lilacs’ which has never since left my head – and so anticipation was indeed high for this. This is incredibly the first professional revival of Gay’s the Word despite it being quite the success in the early 1950s. The plot is frothy nonsense, but a bit of candy floss is delightful now and then. Gay Daventry is a leading lady whose light is fading a little and when facing bankruptcy after an out-of-town flop, seizes on the chance bequest of a keen younger actress and opens up a drama school. But it isn’t plain sailing by any means as the money starts to run out, the doddery teachers grow frustrated with the lack of talent in the student body and some dastardly smugglers also arrive to cause further mayhem. Will Gay be able to save the day with some of her trademark vitality? What do you think 😉 It is all huge amounts of ridiculous fun and performed with such loving warmth in Stewart Nicholls’ production that it is hard to resist. The format means that Novello was able to indulge several aspects of his song-writing along with lyricist Alan Melville. They poke affectionate fun at his own more ridiculous material with the spoof song ‘Ruritania’ (I was pleased to get one of the in-jokes in there); they’ve got the traditional book songs to progress the story of the show; sharp wit is given full rein in the hilarious ‘Teaching’; and Novello indulges another creative side in throwing in a couple of songs that belong to the new musical that is put on at the end. It is all recognisably Novello’s music, but I loved the variety that it allowed throughout the show, and the sense of sheer fun that it generates. This is best exemplified by the Act 1 closer ‘Vitality’, a chirpy and warm full ensemble number brimming with pizzazz, humour and a catchy hook, and in the above-mentioned Teaching is delivered brilliantly by Eileen Page, Myra Sands, Elizabeth Seal (who was actually a member of the chorus of the original production) and Doreen Hermitage as the four women bemoan the life of a teacher cursed with substandard pupils. Elsewhere, Helena Blackman’s clear soprano is well suited to the material, but it is Sophie-Louise Dann who shines above all, pitching the performance perfectly for the intimate space and never letting us forget it is she who is running the show. For obvious economic reasons, the Sunday/Monday show piggyback onto the set of the show having its main run, and as Outward Bound’s seating extends around the edge of the auditorium as well as the traditional end-on bank, this poses a few problems. The choreography tries its best but is often blocked out to the front, and there were a couple of moments where I had a dancer stood in front of me masking my view of the action. Some of the actors also played their scenes firmly forward but at the same time, there’s also a fabulous intimacy that comes from being so close to the playing area. Having the routines just inches from my face raised a chuckle more than once, and Dann is just superb at working the audience and taking particular care to involve us out on the fringes, indeed getting close to being wickedly flirtatious. The entire run completely sold out before it had even started, a consequence partly of the short run but primarily a recognition of the obvious dedication and passion that the Finborough and its various teams bring to their work. Undoubtedly there are moments where the show flags a little, and some of the performances could have done with a little more preciseness in diction and lyrical clarity, but this is the type of warm-hearted production that leaves you inclined to forgive minor shortcomings and with a great big whopping smile on your face. I had long believed that Grease was the word, I think I know differently now."
51,51,Ought To Be Clowns,13/11/2012,Ian,Lea Delaria – Live at the Hippodrome,,"We’re lucky enough to live in a world now where, although there is still much progress to be made, acceptance of gay and lesbian people on the television is pretty much a given. So it is incredible to think that it was less than 20 years ago that Lea DeLaria made history as the first openly gay comic to appear on national TV in the USA. Since then, she has carved out a career in stand-up comedy, theatre and television but arguably most successfully as a jazz chanteuse of some note, revisiting the music to which her jazz pianist father introduced her. Such a repertoire suits the intimacy of the Matcham room, the new cabaret space at the Hippodrome casino, but it is clear that DeLaria revels in the closeness too. A born raconteur, she flirted outrageously and dropped multiple f-bombs within minutes of arriving on stage and peppered her set with fascinating anecdotes from her 30 year career. And what a set it was, taking in selections from all of her CDs (plus a sneak preview of her forthcoming 2013 album) and showing off the supremely fierce skills of her band of three. So Mark Fletcher’s crazy drum skills enliven Cole Porter’s ‘Miss Otis Regrets’, Jerome Kerns’ ‘Yesterdays’ highlighted Simon Little’s smoky rhythms on the bass and leading the ensemble from the piano was Janette Mason – whose presence is incredibly still given how quicksilver fast her fingers explore the keyboard – who dazzled with a range of impressive solos, though it was the reworking of Blondie’s ‘Call Me’ that really made me listen. And then there’s DeLaria. With such an impressive interpretative skill and a voice that is as interestingly coloured as it is undoubtedly powerful, she guided through the 70 minute set with consummate ease. Whether embracing the classics – the opening Welcome to the Party sets the mood perfectly – or scatting her way through a skippy Santa Claus is coming to town, or revisiting the shows in which she has performed (Chicago, On The Town), it was simply bliss to sit and listen to someone so assuredly brilliant at what they do and unafraid to show how much they love doing it."
52,52,Ought To Be Clowns,06/07/2018,Ian,Knights of the Rose, Arts,"The website for Knights of the Rose leads with the quote “is this the most epic rock musical?” and bold as that is, well, the answer is most definitively no. That  much is evident from the start as a bunch of medieval knights start doing some slo-mo running on the spot as they return from war. But even as they dream of the ale to be drunk, the Bon Jovi songs to be sung, the wenches to be laid and other such Olde Worlde fare, a Knight’s lot is never done and a new battle upends their world once again. Sacrifice! Betrayal! Bonnie Tyler! In a time when Bat Out Of Hell can come back, maybe the rock musical is having a moment. But wait, what the hell is Enrique Iglesias doing in here? Not only is ‘Hero’ a fantastically misjudged choice of song, the way in which its first line is used to lead into the track snaps you right out of the world of the show, as evidenced by an audience rolling in the aisles. It was the funniest thing I’ve seen in a theatre this year made all the more so by the fact that it was not meant to be at all hilarious.  An edited snippet of No Doubt’s ‘Don’t Speak’ feels similarly incongruous, ‘He Ain’t Heavy He’s My Brother’ pops up in a po-faced moment and overall, as the playlist starts to sound like Now That’s What I Call Music 1066, you begin to worry for the identity of this show which ultimately takes the idea of being a rock musical as seriously as fancy dress. This pick’n’mix attitude from ‘creator’ Jennifer Marsden is also reflected in a book which picks willy-nilly from classical allusions – an Aethelstan here, a Horatio there, a Palamon looking on moodily from the side (and don’t worry if you think you’ve missed one as every, single, reference is included in the programme…). The melodrama of this knight fancying that girl who fancies that knight, or a different knight fancying another girl who fancies his brother (maybe) proves more Hollyoaks than Henry V. And that wouldn’t be a bad thing if Racky Plews’ production leant in at all to its inherent silliness, embraced the camp along with the Chaucer. But the moment where the horses’ heads look like they’re going to do the iconic Queen pose from the Bohemian Rhapsody never happens, and the bit where a woman duets with her dead fiancé on ‘Total Eclipse of the Heart’ is entirely straight-faced (from the company if not the audience…) and morris dancing is used unironically. And the riotous sense of baffling anarchy that at least makes the first half enjoyable is sapped away after the interval as a dull seriousness takes over. "
53,53,Ought To Be Clowns,23/08/2008,Ian,Piaf, Donmar Warehouse,"A reworking of Pam Gems’ 1978 play which sketches the tragic and tragically short life of French street singer Edith Piaf, it doesn’t actually feature too much by the way of biographical detail as it places the songs for which she is so rightly famous full square and centre. And this is why it is such a success. Roger just embodies the songs, she lives them in front of us and so whilst this tiny Argentinean bears little physical resemblance to Piaf, it matters not a jot as the pure emotion invested in her performance keeps one rapt with attention. Even if you don’t speak French, you understand exactly what she is singing about at any given moment. The brevity of the show (90 minutes) means it is just an emotional rollercoaster which takes you from from her humble beginning to her early successes and then from tragedy to tragedy, doomed love affair to plane crashes, car crashes, emotional crashes. And Roger is onstage for almost every second of it, a truly stunning performance. The rest of the ensemble cover the whirlwind of people around her, lovers and friends, Luke Evans and Leon Lopez bring a nice manliness to the stage ;-), Katherine Kingsley plays a statuesque Marlene Dietrich with a slinky brusqueness and Lorraine Bruce brings a nice comic touch to her sweary prostitute friend."
54,54,Ought To Be Clowns,08/09/2018,Ian,And Suddenly I Disappear – The Singapore/UK ‘d’ Monologues, Southbank Centre,"Honest conversations about disability are difficult to have. Just looking at the range of responses to last week’s announcement of a non-disabled actor taking the lead in the BBC’s new production of The Elephant Man (take a glimpse at the comments on this article, just a quick one mind, the soul can only take so much…) indicates the scale of the problem but also, crucially, how few people really see it as that much of an issue, the systemic way in which disabled people are othered in society.  Someone who does get it is playwright Kaite O’Reilly, whose And Suddenly I Disappear – The Singapore/UK ‘d’ Monologues (the first multilingual, intercultural, Deaf and disability-led theatre project created between the UK and Singapore doncha know!) plays the Southbank Centre as part of their Unlimited Festival. A set of fictional monologues that start a conversation about difference, about disability, by presenting the huge gulf in perception between actual lived experience and what societal conditioning tells you it is.  So a monologue entitled ‘Can’t Do’ spins off in a wonderfully unexpected direction by confounding expectation, another emerges as a visceral rant against those who wear the label ‘disabled’ too lightly, and clichés about macramé and basket-weaving are wittily skewered, more than once. This is done in a variety of media (spoken, visual, projected), in a variety of languages (English, Mandarin, Welsh, British Sign Language and Singapore Sign Language), and pulled together with a real theatrical flourish by director and executive producer Phillip Zarrilli."
55,55,Ought To Be Clowns,07/06/2017,Ian,Barber Shop Chronicles, National Theatre,"The hugely convivial pre-show entertainment for Barber Shop Chronicles is such good fun that I thought to myself I could easily just watch this for an hour. As it turned out, press night delays meant that it was extended by about thirty minutes, during which you really got to appreciate how quietly radical it is. In designer Rae Smith’s hands, the Dorfman has been transformed into a barbershop in the round, into which we’re volubly greeted by the cast and if you’re lucky, you get to sit in the barber’s chair and “get your hair popped” while you wait for the show to start. What I really loved though was the way in which the company so enthusiastically greeted friends, family, loved ones, shattering conventions and fourth walls alike, setting the tone for a truly joyous experience. Crafted by Inua Ellams, Barber Shop Chronicles puts black masculinity in all its multiplicities under the spotlight. by examining the crucial role that barber shop plays in their communities. From Peckham to Lagos, Johannesburg to Accra with Harare and Kampala inbetween, we’re treated to a glimpse into a world that is more, so much more, than just a place to get an “aerodynamic” haircut. It’s a place to find chat, companionship, chargers, to confess to deeper truths than might otherwise be acknowledged in the outside world, even to find surrogate father figures and positive male role models. Across these six countries, we eavesdrop on these conversations and in gaining an appreciation for the diversity in the African diaspora, Ellams also traces the common threads. Bijan Sheibani directs the play with a delicious sense of warmth, scenes are connected with the best musical interludes you could hope to see this year as Aline David’s movement unites the company to expressive and energetic effect. And in a free-wheeling ensemble, every actor gets his moment to shine in the roll call of some thirty characters. The enmity between Fisayo Akinade’s Samuel and Cyril Nri’s Emmanuel – the latter having taken over the Peckham salon owned by the former’s father whilst he’s currently residing at her Majesty’s pleasure – provides a powerful continuing story strand; Hammed Animashaun and Patrice Naiambana (“Look at my neck!”) provide some particularly gloriously comic moments, and I loved Simon Manyonda’s would-be intellectual posturing too. And for all the joy and entertainment that plays out under the light of the fibre-optic cables and twinkling globe, Ellams hits on deeply serious notes, the vicious cycle of troubled legacies – whether personal (those fathers again) or political (Mugabe to Mandela) – feeding into mental health issues -disproportionately prevalent among black men – and round again and again. That said, he also doesn’t let us forget that the barber shop is akin to the black man’s pub and as last orders are called, the curtain call becomes a riotous moment of celebration. No matter what you think of what is happening in the Olivier at the moment, this is a National Theatre nailing its brief for once. "

57,57,Ought To Be Clowns,06/04/2017,mag9l,Posh, Pleasance,"Laura Wade’s Posh first appeared in 2010 at the Royal Court, again in 2012 in the West End, and then in cinemas as The Riot Club in 2014 – each time piercing something of the privilege around the Cameron/Osbourne chumocracy moving into Downing Street at the time of the original premiere. A portrait of insidious male privilege, based on the infamous Bullingdon Club, its intersection of masculinity and class proved a springboard for many a white, privileged actor (James Norton, Harry Hadden-Paton….)  The notion of this all-female production, directed by Cressida Carré, is thus one that feels rich with possibility. So to find that the cast is playing the roles as men, legs still spread, names unchanged, genders unbent, feels like a crucial neglect of that potential. For the dissection of misogyny and privilege is a vital part of Wade’s writing and having women play the roles unaltered, without any new insight, lends the piece a fatal sense of play, of pretence, that undermines the seriousness of its intent. "

59,59,Ought To Be Clowns,12/11/2006,Ian,Dirty Dancing, Aldwych,"For those who aren’t aware, Dirty Dancing is a coming-of-age story, following the 17 year old Baby Houseman who is spending a family holiday in 1963 at a Butlins-type resort in upstate New York. She discovers love in the staff quarters there, her eye being particularly caught by the muscle-bound dance teacher Johnny. The brief clearly seems to have been replicate the film in every way possible, but in doing so so slavishly, they have wrung out almost all the passion and interest from the story and really failed to capitalise on what a stage interpretation could have offered. There’s much use of projections and film to replicate location after location instead of relocating scenes to a smaller number of manageable places which could have been effectively staged. For a play about dancing, there just isn’t enough actual dancing! The sequences where Baby is taught to dance form the meat of the show and consequently drag on for far too long. Partly this is due to the story, but the opportunity existed to play with the film’s screenplay, to amend or add scenes that further show the vitality of dancing rather than the dullness of learning to dance and it is one that has been thoroughly missed here. Likewise, for a musical, there’s precious little singing and some of the best known and loved numbers aren’t even sung, just piped out. Josef Brown in the Patrick Swayze role of Johnny has the buff body and the moves but zero charisma and stage presence; Georgina Rich fails to make much of an impression in the thankless role of Baby and Isabella Calthorpe as her sister seems to have wandered in from a pantomime; only Nadia Cotte as Penny stood out for me, as one of the few characters allowed to exude the sensuality and sexuality for which dancing in a (barely disguised) metaphor in this story."
60,60,Ought To Be Clowns,03/10/2014,Ian,The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd, Orange Tree,"Whilst the news that the loss of its Art Council funding is a terrible blow (especially as Paul Miller’s reign as Artistic Director has barely begun), it was a little surprising for me to hear how vociferous the response was – apparently this venue is much more well-loved and well-regarded than anyone knew. Its mix of revivals of dusty half-forgotten plays and examples of the safer end of new writing has never really connected with me and so despite the best efforts of some to persuade me otherwise, it’s never become a must-see theatre for me. And at first sight, it doesn’t appear that much has changed with Miller’s opening salvo of a DH Lawrence play that is rarely performed but looking further into his debut season, there’s much more excitement to be had – writers like Alice Birch and Alistair McDowell and directors David Mercatali and Paulette Randall suggest a realignment of the theatre to a more pleasingly contemporary aesthetic (though not exclusively, there’s still some Bernard Shaw in there) that could well see me turning into a regular. The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd could thus be seen as something of a bridge, albeit one which is careful to take as many of the existing audience with it. Ellie Piercy’s titular character is a well-worn miner’s wife, worn down by a difficult marriage to a man who loves both his drink and his women. Gyuri Sarossy is utterly convincing as an animal of a man, the very embodiment of a certain kind of masculinity that turns out to be more fragile than he could ever conceive and the toxic atmosphere of their homestead is thrilling in its awfulness."
61,61,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,42nd Street, Theatre Royal Drury Lane,"I liked 42nd Street when I saw it last year but I can’t say that I truly loved it, it felt a 24 carat production of a gold-plate show. But upon revisiting, to celebrate Bonnie Langford’s arrival in the company for its final furlong before closing in the New Year, some kind of magic seems to have happened at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane (or maybe I was just less grumpy tonight!) as it has now matured into something spectacular. The only major difference is Langford’s presence as Dorothy Brock, but there’s just something about her that shimmers with star quality and it is contagious. So even as she’s trying to dampen it down a bit as this particular fading star, her comic timing makes her scenes crackle with electricity, her singing is on point and she’s just a dream to watch. It’s a perfect role for her – who needs stunt casting when you have the right casting? And as for her surprise appearance in the finale? SWOON! I also felt Clare Halse has really settled into the role of Peggy Sawyer. It’s a curious role in that she grows to become the leading lady of this musical as the understudy-come-good, but is given precious little time in which to do so and most of that is taken up with dance. Such amazing dance though, she really is effortless in her every graceful move, and she’s acting more through every movement too as her self-belief slowly blooms into the incandescent life of the finale.    Ashley Day, another (relative) newcomer to the cast, also impresses as the suavely confident Billy, and a shout-out too to Graeme Henderson as dance director Andy who also really has got some moves! Randy Skinner’s choreography is a thing of wonder when there’s this many bodies delivering it in perfect synchronicity (credit to associate choreographer Kelli Barclay and resident choreographer Simon Adkins for keeping them on top of things). From that opening scene, to the mirrored sequence, to those glorious steps of the finale, this is what we mean when we say ‘they really put on a show’. In Douglas W Schmidt’s lavishly sumptuous set designs and under Peter Mumford’s dazzling lights, Mark Bramble’s production just all works, somehow so much better than before. MD Jae Alexander keeps Harry Warren’s score sunny and bright, the cast clearly know how to work Bramble and Michael Stewart’s book to their advantage but above all, there’s no loss of the sense of genuine spectacle to the whole affair. I don’t know long it will be until we ever see a production this size again, don’t miss your chance to see this one now. "

63,63,Ought To Be Clowns,03/12/2012,Ian,Hero, Royal Court,"“I don’t want us to look…naïve” EV Crowe’s new play Hero sees her return to the Royal Court to be reunited with director Jeremy Herrin, but in this tale of two male primary school teachers – one gay and one straight – and the messages they convey both in the personal and the public sphere, everyone seems to have overstretched themselves considerably. The impossibly handsome Liam Garrigan plays Danny, in the midst of applying to adopt a child with husband Joe and seemingly unafraid of anything to do with his sexuality. Daniel May’s Jamie however, struggling to conceive with wife Lisa, reacts incredibly badly when one of his pupils calls him gay, setting in train a troubling chain of events and revelations that spiral wildly out of control.  Everywhere, questionable decisions abound. The structure that folds back on itself at the beginning of the second act reveals nothing new in the replaying of the timeline and just muddies the narrative. The incredibly vivid image of the opening monologue is something that is never revisited, suggesting a real missed opportunity. The use of a Julie London record to signify doubts of a character’s sexuality feels as immature a choice as those exposed in the play and never, personally at least, felt justified by the writing itself. And funny lines are peppered throughout the script but appear at the most random of places, keeping the tone of the piece frequently off-kilter and repeatedly sacrificing the opportunity to explore issues with depth. There’s an intriguing idiosyncrasy at work in Crowe’s writing (just what does she have against Hawaiian pizzas and paella?!) and one which shows promise if she learns to harness it more appropriately. Here, too often it is married with her more conventional characters who are thus pressed into abrupt shifts of mood which just feel forced and counter-intuitive. Daniel Mays resorts to shouting his lines far too often to actually convince us that Jamie’s abrasiveness is an understandable by-product of his closetedness (another curiously unexplored avenue) and though Liam Garrigan’s Danny is initially more appealing, his blinkered certainty soon wears thin. Tim Steed’s excellent Joe ends up having to converse with his husband as if they’ve never discussed anything before; his alleged long-running friendship with Jamie is given little room and thus never convinces; and little is apparent to persuade us that Susannah Wise’s Lisa would ever remain married to Jamie (or indeed marry him in the first place). "
64,64,Ought To Be Clowns,25/06/2010,Ian,Elektra, Young Vic,"Anne Carson’s version of Elektra is the latest play to take up residence in the Maria studio upstairs at the Young Vic. Allegedly having written 123 plays, only 7 of Greek playwright Sophocles’ works still remain, yet they remain ever popular: soon to open at the National Theatre, Moira Buffini’s Welcome to Thebes also takes much from his writing. However, this Elektra is doing things a little differently: no press night, no previews, just opening to its audience, oh and all tickets are completely free (though advance booking is strongly recommended!) Carrie Cracknell’s debut as Associate Director at the Young Vic is a joint effort with Headlong and so it should come as little surprise that it is an inventive fusion of movement, music and text, creating haunting dreamscapes and evocative imagery that really capture the overwhelming aura of grief permeating this play. The whole play is darkly lit with varying shades of gloom and this allows for some eerie dream sequences to be played out with masked dancers at the start, setting the tone for a haunting exploration of grief and what it will drive people to. King Agamemnon has been killed by his wife Clytemnestra as retribution for allowing their daughter Iphigenia to be used as a sacrifice. Their son Orestes manages to escape but their other two daughters remain, Chrysothemis appears unaffected but Electra is devastated, wracked by grief and the injustice of the crime. As news of her long-lost brother begins to filter through she becomes hungry for vengeance and a terrible plan to wreak revenge on her mother and her new lover Aegisthus develops, threatening to keep the endless cycle of violence going. Lydia Leonard is onstage from the moment you enter the Maria studio, curled up asleep in the corner of the marble floor and then never leaves as the devastated Elektra. Haunted by the ghost of her father quite literally, she looks like she hasn’t slept properly since her father’s murder years before and the washed-out Leonard plays the intensity wonderfully, demonstrating her psychological tumult through some harrowing screams, a little diversionary physical activity and the changing cadences of her language, balancing the pursuit of vengeance with a keen awareness of what this is doing to her psyche. Carson is a poet herself and so her version has its own poetic rhythm and depth which Leonard deals with admirably, the use of colloquialisms giving it a more modern feel although I suspect the translation of ‘howling bitch’ maybe uses a little dramatic license! I enjoyed Amanda Hale’s pragmatic and slightly nerdy Chrysothemis, having loved her in Our Class last year and Nadia Cameron-Blakey’s grotesque Clytemnestra was suitably monstrous in her selfishness: Tom Mison was also good as Orestes though I would have liked to have seen more of him. Special mention should go to Babou Ceesay and Cath Whitefield who displayed precision timing in delivering their lines as the Chorus in unison, often in the deep gloom. The lighting by Guy Hoare is superbly done and combined with Tom Mills’ haunting operatic score is most atmospheric. It seems incredible that the Young Vic can mount such an endeavour, involving such a talented cast and a major theatre company, for free. I imagine that this Electra will not be for everyone, it is as much a mood as it is a play but it is hauntingly, stylishly done. Just got back from this play, was brilliant Kiera Knightly was stood behind me intot eh queue to get in. Beautiful woman. Brilliant night! x"
65,65,Ought To Be Clowns,12/05/2006,Ian,The Crucible, Gielgud,"A group of drunken women dancing naked in the woods late one night starts off rumours of witch-craft and devil-worshipping in the little village of Salem and so begins the witch hunt that ultimately leads to the torture and the execution of innocent men and women as hysteria takes over some and cold political survival dominates the elite’s response even at the expense of human life. It’s quite grim, but its power comes from the resonance that it still has today with the political situation in the USA. It is the young women whose actions spur the initial hysteria but Miller doesn’t point the finger at them, rather the older people in the community who allow things to happen for selfish reasons. At the centre of The Crucible is John Proctor, a man caught up in the madness and unable to shake his inherent goodness in the face of the duplicity of so many of the people around him. Iain Glen plays John Proctor with a power and appealing dynamism and an undeniable sexuality that he can’t quite keep in control, Elaine Cassidy as Abigail who tempts John to stray and then manipulates events to cover up her transgressions is excellent as is Helen Schlesinger’s Elizabeth Proctor who in becoming the most charitable of souls has lost most of her actual humanity, such is her emotional repression. There is also great work in many of the supporting performances: Michelle Terry’s Mary Warren, Trevor Peacock’s Corey and James Laurenson’s Danforth particularly sticking in the mind."
66,66,Ought To Be Clowns,07/11/2018,Ian,Romea and Julian, Bread and Roses,"It’s a bold move to open the same show in the same week as the RSC. Erica Whyman’s contemporary Romeo and Juliet is a slick success but Purple Ostrich’s interpretation certainly matches, if not exceeds, it in ambition with its gender-swapped Romea and Julian here at the Bread and Roses tucked away off Clapham High Street. Directed by Laura Kressly, there’s much to admire in this gender-bending free-wheeling adaptation. An all-female company of three take on all the supporting roles with a fresh and ferocious sense of fun – the performative disinterest of Acushla-Tara Kupe’s mike-wielding Lady Capulet being a real standout, alongside Elham Mayhoub’s Nurse. But there’s a curious lack of specificity to the world of this play that undermines some of the impact of the gender flip. The virulence of the opening scene sets us in a feasible world of girl-on-girl crime but from there, we never really get to know why these Montagues and Capulets hate each other so, what is the driving force that leads R+J to such desperate action. As that leading pair, Isabelle Schuler and Jamal Franklin offer up some thought-provoking work that asks its audience to really think about how gender roles shape our thinking. I wasn’t entirely sold that Schuler’s freewheeling bisexual would be so instantly entranced by Franklin’s tender naïf but is that me or society talking…"
67,67,Ought To Be Clowns,08/06/2011,Ian,Titus Andronicus, Baron’s Court Theatre,"It may feel like I’ve been to all the theatres in London but there are so many fringe venues spread across the city that there are some that have yet to be blessed by my presence, the Baron’s Court Theatre in the basement of the Curtains Up pub being one of them. And when they announced an all-female production of Titus Andronicus, a Shakespeare play I have yet to see in order to complete the set, by Inside of Out, it seemed the time was ripe to kill two birds with the one stone. Titus Andronicus has oft been described as one of Shakespeare’s goriest plays and quite frankly the numbers (according to Wikipedia at least) don’t lie: 14 killings (though just the 9 onstage), 6 severed members, between 1 and 3 rapes, 1 live burial and some cannibalism thrown in for good measure. But beyond the barbarity, there is a powerful story too of the corrosive impact of violence on society, of the devastating effect of two opposing sides unwilling to back down and what that does to the individual, the family and even the government. Shakespeare’s Titus is a Roman general who has returned victorious from 10 years of conflict with the Goths with their queen Tamora a prisoner, but a ritual sacrifice avenging the death of his sons sparks off a terrible cycle of revenge with Tamora whose unexpected new position as Empress ensures this is a power game with the highest of stakes, leaving no-one untouched. The all-female casting was an interesting feature but actually had less impact on the interpretation as one might have expected when the focus remained on playing the character rather than the gender. There was perhaps a cast member or two who was guilty of over-egging the masculine gestures (I think there was more crotch-grabbing here than I’ve ever done in my whole life!) but it was rarely that intrusive. Leanne Rivers’ Scots Titus was a domineering figure, the returning hero brought low by both revenging and being revenged upon, a very human figure whose manipulations are perhaps the saddest to witness, human nature driven to its worst. Leah Harounoff’s portrayal of the much-maligned Lavinia was also powerfully done, so much conveyed without speech yet not overplayed. I’m not entirely convinced the decision to have Tamora and her fellow Goths speaking in accented English was a great success whether through necessity or not, it hampered something of the clarity and strength of speaking: something exacerbated by Zoe Wellman’s Aaron, Tamora’s lover and so sharing many of their scenes, who had probably the best command of Shakespeare’s verse out of the entire cast and the best delivery."
68,68,Ought To Be Clowns,12/06/2015,mag9l,Image of an Unknown Young Woman, Gate,"Taking aim at anyone who tweeted #JesuisCharlie (and plenty more besides), Elinor Cook’s Image of an Unknown Young Woman continues the Gate Theatre’s long-running investigations into how the modern world sees and deals with revolution. The nation torn apart by civil war here is unspecified, just A N Other country with a repressive regime but when footage of a young woman in a yellow dress being shot by police at a demo gets uploaded to the internet, the video quickly goes viral, inciting a new social media phenomenon, and is adopted as the latest cause du jour by all and sundry. Twitterstorms flare up about the correct level of anguish to show, sales of yellow dresses on ASOS increase, aid charities start pumping the wealthy for donations and the BBC send over a news crew. But as well as exploring how we, a Western audience (quite literally) respond, Cook also delves into the effects on the people still there like the young couple who uploaded the clip and the woman searching for her mother who may have gotten swept up in the mob. Ricocheting between the emotionally explosive and the physically threatening, between ‘us’ and ‘them’, unsettling truths come to light. On the strutting catwalk of Fly Davis’ design (leaving us in no doubt as to our voyeuristic role), Christopher Haydon’s forceful production disgorges a disorienting energy that bursts through ceilings, walls and our complacency. Ashley Zhangazha’s Ali reaps an ill reward for being the one to film the girl, Eileen Walsh’s Yasmin is utterly heartbreaking as she searches for news of her mother – the welfare of an older woman starkly contrasted with the cultural obsession with the young, pretty, blonde girl in the yellow dress – and asks us how far we would go in such desperation. "
69,69,Ought To Be Clowns,17/08/2010,Ian,Unrelated, Jermyn Street,"After three weeks on holiday, my theatregoing restarted with a gentle introduction with Unrelated, presented as part of the Summer Shorts Season at the Jermyn Street Theatre, where material is performed and tried out with a view to developing shows for potential full runs. Unrelated is a four-hander by Dan Horrigan, an excoriating attack on middle class attitudes and prejudices and the dangers inherent in personal desires, whether in is stifling them to please others or pursuing them with wild abandon. The story is told through two pairings, Martin arrives at a classy prostitute’s Jean’s place with a view to becoming one of her regulars but it soon emerges that all is not as it seems and separately, his wife Annie is engaged in a conversation with journalist Rachel as she comes to terms with the actions of her husband: the action flits between the two developing relationships throughout as we come ever closer to the truth about what has happened and who these people really are. Despite the short running time (60 minutes), 3 of the 4 characters are very well-drawn and engaging. Romilly Turner’s game-playing, confident, high-class prostitute is nicely full of wry observations and a dry humour and is well-matched by Tim Daish’s nervy, slightly gangly Martin, seemingly unsure of what he wants. The way in which this relationship percolates and shifts around was always interesting and kept us on our toes. As the delusional wife Annie, Augustina Seymour gave probably the best performance of the night, gifted by the most fully realised character and the funniest lines. Seymour skilfully negotiated the comic highs and the emotional lows as a conflicted wife, frustrated in her own ambitions and clinging to an ideal of her husband that no longers exists. Conversely, as journalist Rachel who is questioning Anne, Helen Bang suffered from the most under-developed role, she has little to do but ask questions and her one solo moment is unexplored. Unrelated shows a lot of promise, some daringly biting wit and an interesting look at the damaging effects of sexual obsession. It needs a little work, the journalist needs to be better integrated into the action and I’d be tempted to leave the actors on stage throughout, the sudden shift to people leaving and re-entering towards the end felt a little jarring, but otherwise, this does feel like a show to keep your eye out for in the future."
70,70,Ought To Be Clowns,28/05/2012,Ian,Henry V, Theatre Delicatessen,"There’s something a little perverse about the most striking moment in Theatre Delicatessen’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s Henry V being one of no words, but in the anguished looks of two military medical staff waiting in the bunker as conflict rages noisily above them, there’s a flash of genuinely powerful theatre. The horrors of war are sadly timeless and that is something that Roland Smith’s modernisation, loosely redolent of the 1980s, is intent on demonstrating in this tale of a young King Henry wrestling with the burdens of leading men to war. The company have adopted an old BBC building on Marylebone High Street as their new home, and after winding our way through its winding corridors, escorted by firm-handed soldiers, we arrive in a gloomy subterranean bunker with seating scattered around (choose wisely, it’s a long play…). And at times, the production works beautifully. The claustrophobia of the setting and the conflicting emotions of patriotism versus fear sometimes calls to mind the excellent Journey’s End; the scene in which the princess and her lady-in-waiting practise their English is excellently re-interpreted as a time-killing device which almost, but not quite, hides their nerves as conflict rages around them; and a deftness of touch which allows the company to effortlessly double and triple up, often from one scene to the next. But the play’s the thing and Henry V suffers from a ponderous first half and a set of comic characters whose presence calls back to the preceding Henry IV plays and whose presence, in isolation, could be considered something of an indulgence. Smith deals with the latter quite admirably by not overplaying their parts at all, but the former remained something of a problem as the pace occasionally sagged, character lines not drawn quite as strongly as they could have and the verse speaking lacking a little poetry in the jack-booted rushing about. Post-interval though, the constituent parts combine into a much more satisfying whole. Philip Desmeules’ Henry exudes a quiet strength as he builds in stature, Laura Martin-Simpson’s self-possessed Katherine sparkles in their key scene together and Zimmy Ryan is delicately understated as the tragic Boy. Liam Smith and Chris Polick do well as the French King and Dauphin respectively and Alexander Guiney demonstrates great understanding of the verse as the Chorus."
71,71,Ought To Be Clowns,21/11/2019,Ian,& Juliet, Shaftesbury Theatre,"What if Juliet didn’t die? And what if the writer and producer of some of the most iconic pop music of the last two decades (think Britney, Backstreet Boys, Céline, Katy Perry, Robyn, Kelly Clarkson, P!nk just to name a few) decided to lend his back catalogue of songs to a new musical dedicated to her? The result is & Juliet, a slice of energetic and hugely entertaining musical theatre that explodes with joy at the Shaftesbury Theatre.  David West Read’s smartly self-aware book employs a metatheatrical twist as we open with William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway having a barney about the ending to his latest play Romeo and Juliet and she persuades him to give her a bash at writing a new one with him. Thus we pick up in Verona where Juliet reclaims ‘…Baby One More Time’ from Darius and declares her intention to flee to Paris with her best gal pals and flirt with some foreign guys. But as William and Anne tinker with their plotting, the fractures in their own relationship come to the fore, causing some major new plot twists.   There’s injokes aplenty. You either know exactly why there’s a character called May or you don’t, the self-referential script works in any number of gags (‘what’s in a name’ is cleverly done), there’s jabs at authorship, and I loved the acknowledgement of the lyrical daftness of many love songs through the wedding vows. Wittiness abounds though: the slide into ‘Oops I Did It Again’ is genius, so too ‘Since U Been Gone’, and Melanie La Barrie’s Nurse is hilarious throughout (though who knew the OG Mrs Phelps knew words like that!). Martin clearly benefits from having a gigantic back catalogue but there’s something truly impressive about the way that the music has been incorporated here, lyrical synchronicity coming in the most unexpected places (just count the number of different characters who sing meaningfully in ‘Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely’ without a line being changed). Bill Sherman’s arrangements push several songs into surprising new shapes and they all found fantastic under Patrick Hurley’s baton (and so nice to see the band get to take their own bow).  Director Luke Sheppard knows how to stage them too. From the adrenaline shot of the ‘Problem/Can’t Feel My Face’ mash-up with its fierce choreography (Jennifer Weber) to the simplicity of just placing Cassidy Janson downstage to give us so much effing life by ripping through ‘That’s The Way It Is’. Aided by Soutra Gilmour’s glitter-strewn set (so many details to look out for – the numberplate, the bookseller’s cart), Paloma Young’s delightfully brash costumes and Howard Hudson’s lighting which takes you right back to Top of the Pops. And what a cast. Miriam-Teak Lee’s Juliet graduates effortlessly to leading lady without breaking a sweat, looking deadly cool in her every move and nailing some monster pop songs, supported by Jordan Luke Gage’s deliciously daft partner. Oliver Tompsett and Cassidy Janson banter wonderfully as Will and Anne, David Bedella and Melanie La Barrie pull a Jack and Karen by nearly stealing the show from the kids (their ‘Teenage Dream/Break Free’ is inspired. And through all the glitz, Arun Blair-Mangat and Tim Mahendran cultivate a genuine sense of new romantic beginnings that it is impossible not to root for.  "
72,72,Ought To Be Clowns,19/06/2014,mag9l,Dream of Perfect Sleep, Finborough,"On a day when our Prime Minister declared dementia to be “one of [our] greatest enemies of humanity” as a new push for a cure was launched, it seems apt that the Finborough’s latest play Dream of Perfect Sleep should open. For dementia is just one of the issues that Kevin Kautzman has woven into his family drama as two adult children return to the family home for Christmas to a father suffering from a terminal illness and a mother who is no longer compos menti. Mary and Gene are an elderly couple whose devoted relationship is being severely tested by their failing health. She suffers from vertigo as well as dementia and so only has a tenuous grip on reality, which makes his condition all the more tragic as he’s her primary carer and even his infinite patience is being tested. So they’ve made a decision and they’ve invited their estranged kids – recovering addict Robert and new-ager Melissa – to share it. The opening section of the play is beautifully done, heart-breakingly sincere in showing the deep love between Mary and Gene (the Christmas tree is a gorgeous touch) as well as the deep frustrations that characterise declining health. But as it seems we’re heading into tear-jerker territory, Kautzman moves into stranger, denser waters as we delve into Mary’s internal fancies of being an ancient fertility goddess, watching her family watch on helplessly as they debate the inadequacies of the care system. Susan Tracy is superbly sensitive at portraying the complexity of a person whose mental health is abandoning them yet still showing flashes of the adored wife and mother she is, and Martin Wimbush partners her brilliantly, exasperated love in his eyes as he cares for her and her caprices and a resigned ruefulness when dealing with the age-old awkwardness with his son. Cory English’s garrulous Robert and Lisa Carrucio Came’s measured Melissa also hit the right notes."
73,73,Ought To Be Clowns,26/04/2018,Ian,Sunshine on Leith, West Yorkshire Playhouse,"Is a jukebox musical still a jukebox musical when you don’t know most of the songs? You feel that most people would be hard pressed to name more than two songs by The Proclaimers and so it is part of the genius of Stephen Greenhorn (writer) and James Brining (commissioner and director) that they managed to fashion something so perfect, that somehow still feels so familiar, from the back catalogue of the Edinburgh brothers. Sunshine on Leith was first seen at the Dundee Rep in 2007 and though it has toured Scotland a few times since, it has rarely been seen south of the border. So who else to revive it but Brining himself for West Yorkshire Playhouse. And what a straight-up, fantastic success it is. London has seen its fair share of big musicals open this month but none have made me cry, never mind feel so much as this.  It may be jukebox in form but Greenhorn’s book is original, telling the story of two young soldiers returning to their Scottish hometown after a traumatic tour of Afghanistan, struggling to readjust to civilian life. And it uses the music sparingly, allowing characters to really blossom, relationships to flourish, our sympathies to be fully engaged as the lives of this community unfold before us. You get so involved that when someone receives some post from a university in Florida, it honestly comes as something of a surprise that they start to sing ‘Letter From America’. And it is that sense of community that is so crucial to the show’s success. Actor-musicians are sprinkled throughout the company, the band are onstage throughout, and Colin Richmond’s set locates us in the camaraderie of the local pub. And there, it feels impossible not to be entirely swept up in the warmth and humility of these ordinary souls, this everyday music, elevated here to something extraordinary. David Shrubsole’s arrangement of ‘Letter From America’ makes it feel like one of the finest folk songs ever written, the unexpected harmonies in the middle of ‘500 Miles’ send shivers down your spine as does the haunting rhythm of the opening ‘Sky Takes The Soul’, and the sing-along feel of ‘Over and Done With’ is just delightful. And the pleasures aren’t just musical (credit to MD Toby Higgins), Emily-Jane Boyle’s choreography has the easy grace of Frantic Assembly’s finest work.   Given the power of the ensemble, it almost feels churlish to pick out individuals but leading players Steven Miller and Paul-James Corrigan are both excellent as the young men finding their place in a changed world, Jocasta Almgill and Neshla Caplan impress as the women in their lives, and Hilary Maclean’s quietly emotional Jean is just perfect as she cracks even the flintiest of Celtic resolves with a beautiful rendition of the title track."

75,75,Ought To Be Clowns,18/06/2018,Ian,The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Donmar,"Everyone has that teacher that they never forget. Sometimes it’s because they were brilliant, sometimes it’s because they bent the rules, sometimes it’s because they were so bloody-minded that they remain so unforgettable. For the selected few pupils of Edinburgh’s Marcia Blaine School for Girls who found themselves in the orbit of the entirely charismatic Miss Jean Brodie, it’s all three reasons at the same time that are destined to make her such an iconic figure in their schooling. Based on the novel by Muriel Sparks, David Harrower’s new stage adaptation of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie not only marks the 100th anniversary year of Spark’s birth but provides a scorchingly fantastic opportunity for Lia Williams to inhabit the title role so fully as to sit proudly aside Maggie Smith’s Oscar-winning performance in the 1969 film. It’s a stunning piece of acting – elevated by stunning wig and costume work – that captures so much of that beguiling power that a teacher can possess.  Having selected her ‘set’, Miss Brodie delights in flaunting the strict rule of headmistress Miss Mackay and her curriculum, opting instead to explore her twin passions of art history and fascist rulers like Franco and Mussolini. And as she flirts with both music teacher Mr Lowther and art tutor Mr Lloyd, a sense of danger creeps into her interactions with everyone at the school. This is highlighted by Harrower’s framing device which sees one of those former pupils Sandy, now a novelist, being interviewed about her past.    Polly Findlay’s production for the Donmar Warehouse really is excellent. As already mentioned, Williams is perfectly cast as she hovers like the most elegant of butterflies around her charges yet flinches aghast at any display of true emotion. Rona Morison is powerful as Sandy, the most intelligent of the pupils and the one who comes closest to seeing Miss Brodie for who she really is. There’s also strong work from Nicola Coughlan’s Joyce, stuck on the outside of the select few, Angus Wright’s kindly music teacher, and Sylvestra Le Touzel  as the officious Miss Mackay. "
76,76,Ought To Be Clowns,07/11/2019,Ian,Light Falls, Royal Exchange,"Sarah Frankcom’s association with the Royal Exchange goes back more than 20 years, so her departure as Artistic Director will undoubtedly be seismic in some ways. And if the first manifestation of that is the appointment of Roy Alexander Weise and Bryony Shanahan as joint ADs, then Manchester certainly looks in for a treat. Before then though, Light Falls aka it’s grim up north. More than just a tip of the hat to those of us from t’other side of the Watford Gap (Lancashire born and bred, lest ye think I’m a southerner), Frankcom and playwright Simon Stephens visited a number of northern cities and towns to weave together a patchwork of a story about a scattered family.  There is perhaps a touch too much of that archetypal grimness. Characters variously cover alcoholism, depression, drug addiction, suicide, infidelity and I’m tempted to use words like stoic, tough, bleak. A line of dry wit does break through now and again, chinks of light in the darkness but there’s undoubtedly a lot of anguish and pain for a region to soak up here."
77,77,Ought To Be Clowns,10/07/2017,Ian,Queer Theatre – Wig Out, National,"The world has changed just a little in the decade or so since Tarell Alvin McCraney wrote Wig Out. McCraney is now an Oscar-winning writer after the phenomenal success of Moonlight (based on one of his unproduced plays) and RuPaul has dragged drag into the mainstream by its charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent. So to see the play now is an entirely different prospect than its 2008 production at the Royal Court and an interesting example of how cultural touchstones shift.              "
78,78,Ought To Be Clowns,04/09/2011,Ian,Decade, Headlong at St Katharine Dock,"The tenth anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Centre has and will receive a vast range of coverage through all sorts of media, but perhaps one of the most anticipated is Headlong’s new piece of site-specific  theatre, Decade. 19 writers, playwrights mostly and Simon Schama, have all contributed their own responses to the events of the 11th September, their brief purely to be a scene set in the last 10 years, and they have been woven together by director Rupert Goold and housed in a warehouse on St Katharine Docks. I hadn’t intended to see this show so soon, wanting to let the experimental stuff settle before making my visit, but I was forced to reshuffle my diary and in order to fit it in before October and still get one of the cheaper tickets, this was my only opportunity. After passing through a security checkpoint where you are questioned and ticketed (I was mildly disappointed there was no full body search from my guard, Tobias Menzies), we’re then guided through to take our seats in a replica of the dining room of the Windows On The World restaurant, formerly on the top floors of the North Tower. It’s a quirky entrance that sets the anticipation levels high even if the whole process did take a little time to fully accomplish. Seating is around dinner tables with a large raised stage in the middle of the room and is unallocated though ‘waiters’ do take you a table once summoned by the Maître D’. (My top tip would be to try and get on the long bank of seats on the side opposite the bar as close to the middle as you can. Just before the lights went down, I was advised by our Maître D’, in this case it was the delectable Charlotte Randle, that I might want to move from my original seat to this new place as there’s a certain amount which happens on a balcony level but all on one side, and it would have been rather difficult to see from there. So thank you Charlotte!) And then the rollercoaster begins. Starting with a highly evocative piece of movement on the glass-fronted balcony, the many pieces of stories start to unfold. From survivors of the actual attack and those that had lucky escapes to a girl who bemoans the fact that her birthday on the same day will always be remembered for the wrong reasons. From a group of widows who meet in the same NY café every year to commemorate their loss to the emotional tourism industry that built up around the Ground Zero site which is both exploits and is exploited by its workers. The tales are told in different parts of the room, some played out in their entirety, others broken up into segments, one – the annual pilgrimage of the widows over the whole decade – is spread out over the length of the entire show. They do not intersect, no characters reappear, but rather the effect is of a patchwork quilt being built up, of a general sense of the vastness and the variety of ways in which people reacted to the attack. Consequently there are moments of searing acuity, of quiet honesty and of touching reflection. Mike Bartlett’s imagined dialogue between two men about the death of Osama Bin Laden is a punchy, rapid-fire duel, Kevin Harvey particularly good here. Samuel Adamson’s verbatim piece of a system analyst who escaped by virtue of a random day’s leave and whose struggle to find answers saw him sucked into a dark world of conspiracy theorists was a highlight, Tobias Menzies excelling as this quiet, bereft man. Lynn Nottage’s exploration of the way in which the Arab-American population became the victim of horrendous prejudice after the attacks is beautifully judged, the cruel irony of the way African-Americans related to them in particular held up for its hypocrisy. And the way in which the three women deal differently with handling the grief of losing their husbands and then subsequently being bound together by nothing but that grief is movingly portrayed by the excellent Emma Fielding, Charlotte Randle and Amy Lennox. I appreciated the note of ambiguity that some of the writers introduced, especially as this is what chimed most with my own views on the subject matter at large, but also with the lack of easy answers that were provided. The woman who cries when she talks about it even years afterwards but doesn’t know why; Christopher Shinn’s account of a man in therapy whose anger likewise emerges years later but he can’t quite access the reason for it. There were also moments though that left me rather nonplussed or feeling horribly itchy, fragments of stories that struggled to make their connection or their purpose clear, leaving one grateful that the format meant nothing went on for too long. Every so often, the choreography does feel a little superfluous, a bolted-on part rather than integral to the piece, but the majority of Scott Ambler’s work is excellent: a wry take on air stewards opens the second act, the desperation of couples clinging onto each other in moments of crisis beautifully danced and echoed above and there’s an almost tribal feel to some of the group numbers that is highly atmospheric. Adam Cork’s sound design works extremely well too, even incorporating a sung piece in a similar style to London Road, and the overall design by Miriam Buether is well defined. I may well write a separate blog post on my larger feelings about the way theatre – and I suppose by extension our society at large – can and has dealt with the ‘9/11 issue’: I’d rather keep the focus here on Decade. What I will say is that I think I have a problem with the assertion that this was “the defining moment of our times”, the launch point from which Headlong have worked here. I can’t help but feel a little perspective has been lost in the wider historical context of the past 10 years in which so much else has happened too. And what is this ‘we’ that is referred to? Its definition appears to be depressingly narrow when a glimpse at the programme reveals that the writing team appears to be exclusively Anglo-American. Why does the UK claim a special relationship to this tragedy when surely a wider range of nationalities could have added so much more rich diversity to the collective voice. Likewise, the fact that we are 10 years on and history continues to roll on highlights weaknesses in the claim that this was the defining moment. From the cultural clash in a Karachi hospital waiting room to the crisis of conscience in a London tabloid newspaper office to an encounter with Lynndie England, the focus is pulled out to wide and consequently reminds us that a hell of a lot has happened since then as well. By continuing to imbue the 11th September with such lasting importance at the expense of other historical, and arguably just as significant, events from the last decade, we risk losing sight that it was part of the larger continuum of the ongoing history of the world. An interview with Goold last month had me rather worried, this quote standing out “It might sound glib, but the thing I’ve realised rehearsing this is that the time between the first plane going in and the north tower coming down is about the length of a play. It does have that Aristotelean unity to it – one place, one time. I think that ties into people’s memory. In a way, it feels like it validates our approach”. but this really isn’t symptomatic of the piece as a whole at all. In and of itself, Decade is a seriously impressive feat, a unique and unsentimental look at something that remains highly emotive and a truly original way of examining the subject in a respectful manner without hiding the fact that this is a large and unwieldy subject. And in utilising this format, the cumulative collage effect means the overall impact is one of deliberately paced construction, one is never in danger of being overwhelmed by the subject matter.  That it manages this with such theatrical élan should come as no surprise for anyone familiar with Goold’s work and the company work wonderfully under his direction: Tobias Menzies, Emma Fielding and Charlotte Randle standing out for me, though Jonathan Bonnici, Samuel James and Cat Simmons also impressed. At the same time though, I can’t escape the feeling that whilst the ambition behind the original concept is admirable, it is also a little flawed in not incorporating more voices, whether Arab, Asian or African. But Decade nonetheless remains an illuminating piece of highly thought-provoking theatre. A really great review, and thanks for the advice of where's best to sit! Quick question: do you know if you can collect tickets there, or does that have to be done at the National Theatre?  I'm not sure if this venue actually has a box office… Thanks for that. Yup, there's a box office (desk!) just before the 'security checkpoint' where you can collect your tickets. Me thinks the lady doth protest too much: I hadn’t intended to see this show so soon, wanting to let the experimental stuff settle before making my visit"
79,79,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2010,Ian,A Very Musical Evening, Wilton’s Music Hall,"We learned a lot: Hannah Waddingham was announced as the Wicked Witch of the West in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s forthcoming Wizard of Oz; the way to get ahead in musical theatre is to live in the same building as a composer, the UK is a world leader in looking after teenagers with cancer, Joanthan Groff visited Brighton for the first time last week and loved it (quelle surprise!) and Cameron Mackintosh is the most excited he has been since Les Mis about upcoming Stiles & Drewe musical Betty Blue Eyes, based on Alan Bennett’s A Private Function. I don’t know who programmed the event, but the opening sequence of the second half was near perfection for me: Aled Jones singing (he is one of my guilty pleasures, his voice is just gorgeous and album-wise I totally recommend both his Reason To Believe cd and his Christmas collection which is probably the best festive album ever!); Hannah Waddingham giving a most tear-jerking rendition of Send In The Clowns (I know Judi Dench does an excellent interpretation but for my money, this is the ultimate. There’s something about such an amazing singer doing a lyrical version which is just perfect and one day, she will look at me as she sings ‘there ought to be clowns’ and I will die a happy man). And then Gareth Gates doing a lovely rendition of ‘Empty Chairs at Empty Tables’ to a simple piano accompaniment and then blowing my mind with ‘They Don’t Make Glass Slippers’, a beautiful song with which I am obsessed and I can’t wait for Soho Cinders, the Stiles & Drewe show from which it is taken, to finally emerge (or if you can’t wait, you can buy their CD which features the song). Absolute bliss. There’s a putative attempt at a set list below but some of my other highlights were the Priscilla Divas’ vocally fabulous soul medley, starting off with a jazzy You’re All I Need To Get By, Waddingham’s other number ‘Diva’, a fantastically executed exercise in bad pitch and Stiles & Drewe creating a song using words volunteered from the audience including onomatopoeia, locksmith, mushrooms and Pythagoras which gave the song its last ingenious rhyming couplet. Their wordplay is brilliant to behold and perfectly suited to the music hall, they should definitely do more gigs here. It was interesting to see Jonathan Groff, famous for his musical roles but currently in straight play Deathtrap. There was a touching moment where he sang a song from Honk! which was his first featured role in a musical as a 17 year old in Pennsylvania which clearly meant a lot to him, being accompanied by the song’s composer George Stiles, but I was less keen on his other numbers, sorry Gleeks. There were also elements of the more random: Derren Brown-a-like Lawrence Leyton freaked me out a bit with his trickery which wasn’t always smooth-sailing and whilst the Casablanca Steps, a 20s cabaret quartet were obviously very talented, the acoustics meant that a lot of their verbiage was lost which was a shame. Don Black hosted an auction to raise money for TCT with some fun prizes but all ending up out of my impoverished reach. With events of these sorts, the disclaimer is always there that the line-up is subject to change and when performers are giving so generously of their spare time, it is hard to begrudge them for no-shows, no matter how frustrating it is if you’ve booked especially to see them. So all credit is due to the producers (including Ellie Collyer-Bristow) for managing to secure the appearance of every single announced artist, no mean feat considering one of them was in LA in the morning and another was performing on the same night in Wimbledon. But of course there’s the more serious side to matters in that we were coming together in support of the Teenage Cancer Trust. There are so many charities and good causes that one can support and it is often the personal connection that helps make the decision, but an enlightening and passionate speech from Dr Adrian Whiteson OBE, Life President of TCT with his wife Myrna, about the importance of the work of this charity, in providing specialist units for teenagers and young people with cancer and support networks for those around them really made clear what an vital and trailblazing cause this is. To read more and to find out how you too can support them, please do visit their website at www.teenagecancertrust.org So a very musical, very special and very fabulous evening for a truly worthy cause. One of those nights that make me glad I live in London and a perfect way to restore the flagging spirits of a tired theatre-goer   Jonathan Groff – You Haven’t Got Nothing(?) I was there and this is a very acurate report of a Wonderful star studded evening, so pleased that I was able to be there, what a bargain too at £30 for a ticket. What did you think of that 16 year old Daniel Lane? I was there last night and thought he was great – can definitely see him in the West End one day! 🙂 I was impressed with Daniel Lane but found it hard to believe he was only 16, he looked much older. I agree, he seemed much older than 16!  He was very good with his song, but it was a shame he didn't get to do a more well-known number as well as it is hard to judge someone on an unfamiliar piece of music.  He definitely held his own in esteemed company though. Your knowledge in this website is very well.I read this website I think we need the knowledgeIn this website.  locksmiths london "
80,80,Ought To Be Clowns,30/01/2020,Ian,Body Talk, VAULT Festival,"LGBTQ+ champions Full Disclosure Theatre took on open marriages to tremendous effect with Open at last year’s VAULT Festival, so my eyes were naturally drawn to their entry into this year’s event. David Hendon’s Body Talk takes a look at the thorny issue of male body image in the gay community, asking what happens when you think you’re too skinny, or too fat, or even too hashtag instagay perfect to fit in. We meet three men, all approaching a significant birthday and all unhappy with some aspect of their appearance, to the point where patterns of self-destructive behaviour are ruling their lives. Carl is a thin guy who is about to turn 21 but can’t stop purging; Cameron and his abs have hit half a million followers on Instagram but on the cusp of 30, he’s not sure how far to go to maintain interest; and Phil is approaching 40 by staring down the end of several bottles of wine a night and bemoaning an expanding waistline.  The first part of Chris Davis and Sam Luffman’s production is the strongest, as intertwined monologues delve into the mindset of each man, biographical detail bleeding into psychological insight, exploring how the challenges of growing up gay can shape so much of later life. Dominic Jones’ Carl, Taofique Folarin’s Cameron and Mark Philip Compton’s Phil all shine here, whether telling their own story or playing supporting roles in each other’s with wry humour. As connections build up between the trio, the shift into straight drama is well executed, as we see those behaviours previously referred to in a real-life context. And the pursuit of the constantly unattainable is one with powerful resonance – chasing that hot guy or losing that last bit of body fat and not giving a fuck how you get there, there’s always going to be one more thing that means satisfaction proves elusive, especially in a community as notoriously harsh as (some of) the gays."
81,81,Ought To Be Clowns,04/07/2013,Ian,Bracken Moor, Tricycle,"With a revival of The Pride just announced as the next production in Jamie Lloyd’s Trafalgar Studios residency, it seemed like a good time to visit Alexi Kaye Campbell’s latest play Bracken Moor at the Tricycle. That said, I have to admit to not being the greatest fan of this ambitious mash-up of political/economic drama and ghost story which is co-produced by Shared Experience and directed by their own Polly Teale. In the midst of the 1930s financial crisis, Yorkshire landowner Harold and his wife Elizabeth are still shell-shocked by the ghastly death of their young son Edgar ten years since and only now are they acquiescing to an extended visit from their old friends Vanessa and Geoffrey. But as they retrace their old friendship, the presence of the visitors’ son Terence awakens something more sinister. Terence was Edgar’s boyhood best friend and within a few nights, appears to become possessed by Edgar’s restless spirit. This provokes his parents to finally start to deal with their buttoned-up grief but in hugely different ways. Helen Schlesinger’s extraordinarily affecting Elizabeth clings to every possible shred of hope that she could actually be communicating with her lost son and the rawness of her grief is spell-binding. And the much more pragmatic Harold, Antony Byrne in classically old-school English mode, finds himself questioning the decisions he has to make about a dispute over pit closures, his capitalist certainties challenged by this brush with the unknown. But it is all very dry stuff. The aforementioned debate about the pit closures versus plans to try and save jobs opens the play with an almost stagnant pace and the wood-panelled, staircase-dominated set designed by Tom Piper just feels too cavernous, leaving the actors marooned and sapping the energy from many a scene. The supernatural scenes, once they come, will undoubtedly make you jump but that is because of the loud noises rather than any sense of the genuinely chilling and given the arid nature of so much of the writing, it is hard to feel any real sense of engagement with these characters or their plight."
82,82,Ought To Be Clowns,23/04/2019,Ian,All My Sons, Old Vic,"You do wonder how new playwrights are ever going to get a look-in when Arthur Miller can dominate London theatres without it even being a significant anniversary year for him. That said, the Old Vic’s second Miller in a row sees a Headlong co-production of All My Sons (with Death of a Salesman imminent at the Young Vic, he’ll have the run of The Cut) that gives an enviable target to aim for. I’ve seen a handful of All My Sons since starting the blog, from the sublime and superb to the somewhat less impressive, and it is remarkable how it stands as a play that really needs little doing to it for its quality to shine through. And so it is with Jeremy Herrin’s production here, a relatively straightforward one for Headlong all told, but all the more effective for it.  Max Jones’ design gives us the Kellers’ humble home simply, their backyard spread out over the stage and so it is the beauty of Richard Howell’s lighting that really stands out. Dappled sunlight turns to a tender dusk but as the weight of the play’s tragedy starts to assert itself, shadows start to lengthen and the move into punishing darkness characterises the severity of this long night. And free from distractions, superlative unaffected acting fills the gap in this dissection of a shattered American Dream. Sally Field is everything you’d hope for and more as matriarch Kate and Bill Pullman is excellent as the haunted Joe. Both made old too soon by the lies they’ve internalised, both unable to escape the hollowness of their picture-perfect lives and the grief they long to hide. "
83,83,Ought To Be Clowns,27/06/2014,mag9l,Khandan (Family), Royal Court,"The second Birmingham Rep show to make its bow in London this month (Rachel De-lahay’s Circles being the first), Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti’s Khandan (Family) transferred for a short run at the Royal Court upstairs. Bhatti explores the dynamics of a first-generation Sikh family and their various complex ties to the notion of ‘home’, whether the Punjab to which matriarch Jeeto longs to return after emigrating to Birmingham in 1969 or the England in which her children were born. Roxana Silbert’s production has much to appreciate in it but not really enough to engage and truly enjoy. The play skates over the domestic travails of all concerned but without ever really digging deep into the characters, they remain little more than ciphers. Rez Kempton’s ambitious Pal clearly loves his wife Liz yet her pain at their childlessness, something which Lauren Crace evokes beautifully, is something he brutally ignores. Oddities like these are scattered throughout, driving the plot at the expense of character credibility."
84,84,Ought To Be Clowns,18/08/2013,Ian,Liolà, National Theatre,"Expectations are a funny thing. Luigi Pirandello’s reputation as one of our foremost dramatists comes from his metaphysical musings on identity and self but his 1916 play Liolà comes from a very different place and so may leave you nonplussed if expecting something akin to Six Characters in Search of an Author. Instead, Tanya Ronder’s new version directed by Richard Eyre is a rollicking tale full of song and dance, set in a Sicilian village from which most of the men have migrated. The two that remain, Liolà and Simone, are surrounded by a veritable multitude of women with whom a number of complicated relationships are in place. Ageing landowner Simone married the much younger Mita in order to provide him with the heir he desperately craves but five years of marriage have produced no children. By contrast, local lothario Liolà has knocked up at least three of the local girls and now has three children who are raised by his mother. But when he gets Simone’s young cousin Tuzza pregnant, she and her mother espy a scheme to play on Simone’s fears of childlessness and pass the child off as his own. But Mita and Liolà were childhood sweethearts and together they plot her own revenge.  Everything is done under the watchful view of the community but even though the location is Pirandello’s native Sicily, Eyre has made the characters all Irish and the frequent musical interludes contains elements of folk and gypsy tunes that feel closer to the Balkans. Where some might find confusion in this melding of styles, I found it liberated the piece, finding echoes in plays such as Friel’s Dancing at Lughnasa and Lorca’s Bernard Alba, (mostly) Catholic communities simultaneously finding ways to break the rules that bind their society yet casting the ultimate scorn on those who are caught.  And it is powerfully, persuasively done. The likes of Rosaleen Linehan as Mita’s aunt Gesa, Charlotte Bradley as Liolà’s mother Ninfa and Eileen Walsh’s spinster of the parish Càrmina fill the air with fruity gossip and tuneful song as they sit shelling almonds and pass comment on all that goes before them, especially the intransigent Azzaras – a near-hysterical Aisling O’Sullivan and a taciturn Jessica Regan as the mother and daughter who dare to look out for themselves. Rory Keenan is outrageously charming as the titular Liolà, wittily possessed of his own accompanying band but also possessed of an underlying sadness at his roguish destiny. Lisa Dwyer Hogg’s Mita is affecting as the much-maligned Mita but as she engineers the situation to her advantage, the sly satisfaction at the downfall of her rival suggests the beginnings of lifelong feuds rather than happy endings."
85,85,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Lucy Light, VAULT Festival,"Is it wrong to like Atomic Kitten’s cover of ‘The Tide is High’? I suspect the answer would be a resounding yes for most people but for Lucy and Jess, two teenage girls from a northern seaside town, (and let’s face it, me), they’ve even got the dance routine from the video down pat, complete with brilliantly improvised wind machine. They’ve just finished their GCSEs and life ought to be hunky dory but Lucy’s mum has got breast cancer, casting a shadow not only over this summer but over the next ten years as we see in Lucy Light. For the genetics of the c word, particularly when BRCA 1 is concerned, is a bastard but Lucy is prepared to make some tough decisions. Sarah Milton’s play visits this pair of best friends at 15, 22 and 26, a crucial decade for both, as though the ramifications of Lucy’s choice to undergo a pre-emptive mastectomy is eloquently woven throughout every scene, the play is much as about the minutiae of ‘normal’ life too. The endless hangovers, being stuck in dead-end jobs, growing up in the same place as your high-school crushes and above all, the intensity of those friends and family bonds that get you through the worst of times. And Emmy Rose and Amy Clark both give beautifully pitched performances as they show all the messy complexities of the journey from teenage angst to young adulthood."
86,86,Ought To Be Clowns,24/05/2017,Ian,Sasha Regan’s All Male Mikado, Richmond,"If it ain’t broke, why fix it? Sasha Regan alighted on a winning formula with her stripped-back all-male takes on Gilbert and Sullivan’s operettas and has toured the likes of The Pirates of Penzance and HMS Pinafore the length and breadth of the country and even to Australia. So it is little surprise to see her turn to The Mikado (or The Town of Titipu) to see if lightning can strike again with joyous shout and ringing cheer. The production is set in the grounds of a 1950s-ish school camping trip, a canny move which neatly sidesteps some of the Orientalism issues and refocuses G+S’s satire on the English political establishment. And with the score for solo piano confidently played by musical director Richard Baker, the harmonious meld of the 16-strong company sounds like a dream, and don’t look half bad either delivering Holly Hughes’ effervescent choreography. There’s more opportunity for the boys playing ladies to cut loose and have some fun and so it is the likes of Richard Russell Edwards as Peep-Bo (superlative comic timing) and Alex Weatherhill as Katisha (also very funny indeed) who steal scenes unashamedly. And Regan ensures that there’s a great deal of humour in the lightness of touch with which the whole show is played – the ‘beauty’ scene, the little chalkboard, the washing lines, the little details really have been thought about."
87,87,Ought To Be Clowns,17/12/2011,Ian,Joking Apart, Union Theatre,"The next all-male Gilbert and Sullivan production at the Union (Patience) appears to be taking place early next year rather than taking the pre-festive slot that one has become accustomed to over the last couple of years, and instead we’re being treated to a bit of Alan Ayckbourn with his 21st comedy Joking Apart. Despite his reputation, I’ve never really connected with Ayckbourn in my limited experience of his work, the revival of Snake in the Grass being a notable exception, and not even a truly stellar cast could rescue Season’s Greetings for me at the National. But the Union have a strong track record in creating effective small-scale productions and so I was intrigued to see how this would go. Spread over 12 years, Joking Apart visits blissfully happy couple Richard and Anthea in their back garden at four-yearly intervals, following their relationship with the friends and neighbours around them and how those connections alter over time. From Bonfire Night in 1970 to a balmy summer Friday evening in 1982, with a Boxing Day and a random Sunday morning inbetween, we see how they interact with the earnest vicar and his highly strung wife, Richard’s Scandinavian business partner and wife, and his junior colleague Brian with his succession of young girlfriends. It actually emerges as quite a dark story. Though the central couple are (rich and) happy, that happiness is starkly contrasted with the various dissatisfactions of the lives of those around them, indeed caused by them. There is humour in here, much of it deriving from Kingsley Hall’s costumes which include some outrageously short shorts and sharp shoulder pads and the amusing array of women that Brian dates, all impressively played by Antonia Reid, and the clever use by director Ben de Wynter of the off-stage-left area as the tennis court from which we hear all sorts of antics. Ayckbourn is more concerned though with the excruciating awkwardness that comes from the deterioration in these friendships, as ambitions are frustrated, jealousies pervade and passions stifled. The flashpoints that come, in Andrew Obeney’s bitter explosion as the envious workmate or Jamie Richards’ desperate declaration of love for the woman next door, are expertly done in fabulously cringe-inducing detail, especially in the face of Jamie Kenna and Claire Marlowe as the obliviously unaware central couple, full of chirpy breeziness. But to my mind, there is too much focus on the awkwardness which isn’t sufficiently contrasted with something else to underline its effect. I didn’t really find the play to be as funny as I wanted it to be; and at times, the production loses its clarity. Without the programme, I don’t think I’d’ve clocked we’d skipped four years as Scene Two started and there was little attempt to convince that it was Boxing Day in the third scene, one character even decided to take his coat off despite being outside – small things, but ones that stuck out for me. By and large though, this is a very accomplished production, it’s just a shame I didn’t think the play was particularly deserving of it."
88,88,Ought To Be Clowns,20/02/2011,Ian,Snake in the Grass, The Print Room,"Snake in the Grass is the London premiere of this Alan Ayckbourn play which is a rarity in itself as it marks one of his forays away from his more usual comedy. It is described by Ayckbourn himself as ‘a ghost play’, but it is more obviously a psychological thriller, threaded through with recognisable hints of class struggles and flashes of mordant humour. Directed by Lucy Bailey, who with Anda Winters have converted this Notting Hill warehouse into one of London’s newest new fringe venues, The Print Room. Set in the grounds of a large country house, the play follows two sisters who are reunited after 20 years following the death of their authoritarian father. Annabel escaped her father’s clutches to Tasmania only to find new devils there, whilst Miriam stayed to care for their father but was driven to extreme measures. Finding themselves back together and then visited by a vindictive former nurse of their father’s who was dismissed, they find themselves having to deal both with the haunting ghosts of the past and the psychological threats of the present. Susan Wooldridge as the older Annabel and Sarah Woodward as Miriam were both excellent at portraying the fractious relationship between the estranged siblings, forced together by circumstance and having to deal with the blackmailing demands from Mossie Smith’s abrasive Alice and whilst all three women delivered strong performances, Woodward was particularly outstanding at charting the multiplities of Miriam’s psyche. Staged in traverse, with the audience sat either side of William Dudley’s effectively designed overgrown and disused tennis court, all aspects of this production slotted together extremely well with Richard Howell’s eerie lighting and Neil Alexander’s sinister sounds ratcheting up the tension as the plot wound its way to its twisty conclusion. So something of a pleasant surprise as an atypical Ayckbourn and an unmissable opportunity to see acting talent as superb as Sarah Woodward up close and personal."
89,89,Ought To Be Clowns,27/10/2016,mag9l,The Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures, Hampstead,"Tony Kushner’s The Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures has been given the moniker #iHo for short, though quite why that impulse has kicked in now is not clear, for the play is a hard-going three and a half hours full of wordily complex pontifications. The mechanics of social media aside, to suggest that it can be encapsulated in a three letter hashtag feels crudely reductive. The play centres on the Marcantonio family, a brood of Italian-Americans summoned back to their Brooklyn brownstone by patriarch Gus who has decided to commit suicide. He says it is because of encroaching Alzheimer’s but it is his ideals that this former Communist has lost rather than his marbles, and it is this crisis that sparks off lengthy debate after lengthy debate about faith and politics, socialism and America with his three adult children and their motley collection of partners. And when I say lengthy I mean it, the verbosity of the title is a powerful indicator as to the nature of the vast majority of the dialogue in the play and it is tough, tough going. For example, Kushner and director Michael Boyd offer up a scene of near-transcendent symphonic clamour as everyone pitches in to an overlapping shouted argument but ultimately it is hollow, for it is dramatically inert. So naturally it happens again and again, Wikipedia entries regurgitated and reinterpreted as white noise. In some ways that’s unfair, the intellectual depth of Kushner’s writing is presumably kosher (I’m not going to pretend to I picked up half the references and allusions here). But in loading up his characters with such heavyweight intelligence, he’s neglected to give them corresponding heart – there’s far too little sense of them as real people, related people at that. And so by the time the storm quietens down for a moving pair of final scenes, it’s almost too little too late."
90,90,Ought To Be Clowns,06/10/2012,Ian,A Winter’s Tale, Unicorn,"The family-centric Unicorn Theatre invites us into a world of make-believe with this production of Ignace Cornelissen’s A Winter’s Tale. Four actors are putting on a playful performance of The Winter’s Tale but we see them slipping in and out of their roles as they squabble about who gets the best parts, take time out for sandwiches and get lost in the personas they are playing, whilst giving us a condensed version of Shakespeare’s tale of a king whose jealousies of his wife and best friend has far-reaching consequences. With crocodiles. And playful is the word. The company of four relish the freedom they’re granted here: Ben Caplan’s King Freddy (Leontes) is an amusingly disgruntled figure who is the self-appointed leader of the group and Sam Swann’s King Tunde (Polixenes) an appealingly chilled-out presence whose easy friendship with Ginny Holder’s Queen Tamara (Hermione) provokes Freddy’s ire. Flemish Cornelissen doesn’t back away from the darkness of the story in Bohemia either, though he tempers the sadder moments with quick comic cuts – Holder bearing the brunt of the funniest one – always reminding the audience that this is just a tale we’re watching. The actors switch between roles effortlessly as we move to Sicily – which gives Kae Alexander the later chance at a bigger part after she is sulkily relegated to the initial role of gamekeeper – and the clear use of props by director Purni Morell ensures a lack of confusion. There is a slight sense of unevenness from the writing though. Cornelissen mostly drops the device of slipping out of character for the latter half of the play, preferring to just run through the lighter vibe of Sicily, all bubble-machines, hula-hoops and random peg-involving party games. But he redeems himself with a powerfully unexpected ending which works beautifully in terms of this piece of writing and the ambience it has created, but also tear-jerkingly so in an entirely different way for those who know Shakespeare’s play. This performance was one of the Unicorn’s relaxed performances, for those who benefit from a more relaxed atmosphere with regards to making noise, a vitally important innovation from a theatre that is determined to ensure its provision is accessible to the widest range of children possible. There was something fascinating in witnessing the power of theatre in this way, seeing what was proving most effective in grabbing and keeping their attention and the actors – Swann in particular – should be commended for their sensitivity in incorporating these reactions into the show."
91,91,Ought To Be Clowns,07/10/2010,Ian,Jersey Boys, Prince Edward,"So part two of my West End Groupon deal and an interesting one for me as it was a long-running show that I can honestly say I would never have gotten round to going to see on my own behalf: Jersey Boys. The story of four guys, Frankie Castelluchio, Tommy DeVito, Nick Massi and Bob Gaudio who rose from their humble New Jersey beginnings to rise to the top of the charts as Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Things did not get off to a good start with a rap version of ‘Oh! What A Night’ and being exhorted to clap along: it is just too early in the night to start with that business and it is not like it is the type of show where there is lots of audience participation so I found it an odd way to start. We then slid into the regular run of things with the story of how the group came together and then found success, being narrated in four quarters, or seasons (see it’s clever!) by each of the band members. The music, much of which was unfamiliar to me I have to admit, as by the band in their various performances and tours which I really liked, but then oddly, random songs became story devices. So, ‘Oh! What A Night’ became a tale of the group visiting a brothel and having his innocence plucked from him though with a premature ending (‘As I recall it ended much too soon’…!). It was a bizarre moment and one that didn’t work for me and I was glad to see the majority of the rest of the music being performance-based. There were quite a few aspects of the production that I didn’t get: I wasn’t a fan of the cartoon graphic screens that popped up every so often and thought they added little, though I did generally like the set and its surprising simplicity. But I have no idea in heaven why a man on a moving drum kit kept randomly appearing, sliding and spinning across the stage, weird weird weird. And as the pace of the show is just so relentless, it just races through huge amounts of story without stopping to really convince us of the relationships behind the scenes which would give the show some much needed heart. And it also paid little attention to demonstrating the passage of time, I had no idea we’d covered over 10 years at one point! Ironically, having bemoaned the use of songs as narrative rather than performance devices, the one time I was truly moved was during ‘My Eyes Adore You’, sung by Valli to his bitterly disappointed wife and beautifully harmonised. It was one of the few times where true emotion was displayed on the stage and allowed to play out for more than 30 seconds. There’s no doubting that it is well performed: I liked all four main guys but I think Stephen Ashfield edged it in his narration section with his geekily charming demeanour as songwriter Gaudio, though Jon Boydon’s Jersey drawl was great fun. As Frankie, Ryan Molloy is good but rarely gets the chance to show the heart and soul behind his character and so it ultimately felt a bit too shiny for my liking. I wasn’t a fan of Simon Adkins’ rather effeminate record producer allowing for a depressingly predictable audience reaction laughing at yet another mincing unsophisticated portrayal of a gay man."
92,92,Ought To Be Clowns,02/10/2019,Ian,A Partnership, Theatre503,"Playing out over an hour of real time, Rory Thomas-Howes’ two-hander A Partnership takes an incisive look at modern gay relationships and asks big questions about what they could and should like, now that so many battles over equality have been won. Now that the gays can have a ‘normal’ life, what might that look like? For Zach, it means breakfast islands, posh toastie makers and a Nutribullet. For Ally, it means being able to hold his boyfriend’s hand in the pub on a work do, maybe even give him a kiss. And as the pair of them return to their new flat to wait out the hour before Ally’s 30th birthday starts, the faultlines in their five-year relationship begin to buckle.  And between the bottles of birthday gin and lines of coke, it soon becomes apparent that problems are running deep here. Thomas-Howes brings layers of sensitivity to Zach, a man buried under so much internalised homophobia that he can barely breathe, just lash out with the grandest of gestures to try and maintain the status quo. Ben Hadfield’s Ally makes for an intriguing partner to him, far more gregarious in nature and initially the more obvious target for our sympathies. But as we dig deeper into the issues here, culpability lies all around and the focus shifts to an almost Albee-like torrent of built up resentments and hostilities that cut increasingly deep. Director Josh Tucker keeps a firm grip on the many conversational swerves, both sides of the tragi-comic coin are fully explored here, and they do occasionally get a little dizzying. You wonder how Ally and Zach have managed to get this far but then that’s kinda the point, the extent to which we are willing to lie to ourselves in order not to rock the boat."
93,93,Ought To Be Clowns,08/06/2017,Ian,Cover My Tracks, Old Vic,"Former Noah and the Whale front-man and songwriter Charlie Fink is no stranger to the Old Vic, having composed the rather lovely score for The Lorax, but his return takes a rather unconventional form in the shape of Cover My Tracks. It occupies that strange place of ‘play with songs’, or ‘live gig and modern folk tale’, or ‘night of live music and theatre’, anything but call it a musical apparently – that probably wouldn’t fit with the brand that the Old Vic are trying to establish with their Lates programme. In the end, it doesn’t really matter what you call it, as the combination here is subtly beguiling. Reuniting with Lorax scribe David Greig, Fink plays Frank, a depressive young songwriter who has split with his band due to ‘artistic differences’ of a sort and Jade Anouka takes the role of Sarah, the hotel worker who intervenes in his life at a crucial moment, seemingly setting it on a new path. Frank though, is determined to find a uniquely 21st century route into rockstar immortality which involves disappearing completely. The story is recounted by Sarah, in a gorgeously positioned performance from Jade Anouka, wry and wistful, heartfelt and heartbreaking, and soundtracked by Frank’s melancholy songs, played live by Fink on guitar with additional backing. Fink also gets to play Frank in flashback, rather amusingly as they embark on an unlikely musical odyssey together. Max Webster’s direction is quietly effective, relying on Lee Curran’s sculptured lighting design for real impact, and preventing it from ever seeming too static."

An intergenerational take on women’s experience over the last 60 years or so, it promises a lot but doesn’t quite carry through. Set in a hotel suite on the eve of a wedding, Debbie Chazen’s Suzanne has cracked open the booze and settled in for the night with her mother, Anita Dobson’s gin-soaked Eleanor and her daughter, Maisie Richardson-Sellers’ gender-fluid Laurie. They have a lot to talk about.  Problem is, it’s all a little bit formulaic in the way that the one generation reacts against the other. Against Eleanor’s staidness, Suzanne indulged her hippy side; against that tradition, Laurie embodies every millennial trope down to a T.  It makes ‘sense’ but it rarely convinces, too often characterisation is abandoned for issues."

97,97,Ought To Be Clowns,12/07/2014,mag9l,Macbeth, RIFT at Balfron Tower,"Immersive schimmersive. In the creation of ever-more inventive ways of approaching familiar stories, theatre companies are consistently pushing the boundaries of what makes a theatrical experience and the set-up for RIFT’s 12-hour Macbeth complete with sleepover is certainly eye-catching. The reality though is quite something else – if sharing a dorm with strangers doesn’t appeal, you can pretty much leave at 1am without missing too much, and the practicalities of dividing the audience into three small groups each with their own Macbeth and Lady M stultifies the pace rather than invigorating the show. "
98,98,Ought To Be Clowns,23/12/2013,Ian,Aladdin, New Wimbledon,"Coming out of Puss in Boots, I said this will be the last panto I see this year. Oh no it wasn’t… The New Wimbledon has built up a reputation to rival the Lyric Hammersmith and the Hackney Empire in London pantomimes, producing slickly professional productions starring high-profile names such as David Hasselhoff, Dame Edna and last year, Priscilla Presley. This year though, the celebrity wattage is homegrown in the form of Jo Brand, who takes the role of the Genie of the Ring in Aladdin.  And with someone who actually understands what pantos are all about (Presley’s air of bemusement at the whole shebang was hilarious), the dynamic of the show feels like a properly old-school affair. Brand’s hugely dry wit makes her perhaps too laconic a presence for the kids but she certainly makes the adults laugh, the presence of two Britain’s Got Talent acts lends a variety feel to the whole affair and in Matthew Kelly’s Widow Twankey, there’s a game dame indeed. It makes for a fascinating combination, one that isn’t always 100% successful to be honest given the completely different gears in which the performers are operating. As funny as Brand is, she doesn’t really fit into the ensemble; Kelly’s grandstanding is funny but it is left to Alan Committie’s Wishee Washee to do the interaction with the kids and he might just be overplaying it a little with the enthusiasm. But there’s much to enjoy here too."

100,100,Ought To Be Clowns,08/03/2018,Ian,Jubilee, Lyric Hammersmith,"There’s a sense of Chris Goode’s adaptation of the 1978 Derek Jarman film Jubilee getting out ahead of itself as one of its key characters delivers the above speech pretty much as we begin. But no amount of self-awareness can give this production enough life to sustain its punkish attitude over a bloated running time. Running at a reconfigured Lyric Hammersmith (design by Chloe Lamford) after playing the Royal Exchange late last year, there’s a definite statement of intent from the very beginning as the queer inhabitants of a squat take up residence. Cocks are waved, breasts are bared, queens are transported (Lizzie One Point Zero) and new kweens established, Travis Alabanza’s Amyl Nitrate.  And in this contemporary world (a set of to-the-minute references leave us in no doubt of that), these punks fight against a world that is fighting against them, giving as good as they get. Police brutality squares up against murderous one-night-stands, commercial consumerism battles high art, the past versus the present (versus the future).  "

102,102,Ought To Be Clowns,11/02/2016,mag9l,Road Show, Union,"Since its inception in 1999, Stephen Sondheim’s Road Show – with book by John Weidman – has undergone considerable rehabilitation, not least three title changes, and so has rarely been seen on this side of the Atlantic. John Doyle transferred his Off-Broadway production to the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2011 for its European premiere but this is the first UK revival since then, director Phil Willmott continuing a mini-residency at the Union after last month’s fine Fear and Misery of the Third Reich.  But where the episodic nature of Brecht’s storytelling worked well, Road Show is less successful in stringing together its vignettes of chasing the American Dream into something more affectingly substantial. The show follows the contrasting but always connected lives of brothers Wilson and Addison Meisner (per the programme) as they seek to parlay guts and gumption into something more, taking unsuspecting benefactors, love interests and easy marks along for the ride. As the story bounds from the goldmines of Alaska to the real estate boom in Florida with plentiful stops inbetween (one song voyages between Hawaii, Asia and Guatemala alone), it rarely digs in with any real depth. Wilson is the ambitious chancer, twinkle-eyed and twinkle-toed as he charms all around him; Addison is a touch more reserved, wanting the chance to explore his dream of becoming an architect (so he’s got somewhere to house the souvenirs from his trip) to come to him, but we never really get to know either. Andre Refig is powerfully charming as garrulous gambler Wilson and Howard Jenkins contrasts well as the more measured Addison and both are possessed of striking singing voices, which are matched well by Richard Baker’s strong musical direction. But both characters lack substantive support – the former’s marriage to a rich widow is passed off speedily whilst the latter’s love affair with rich kid Hollis (at least this character is actually credited with a name) is also crucially underdeveloped, despite good work here from Joshua LeClair. And perhaps as a reflection of this, Willmott’s production feels strongest at its simplest, the key relationships gleaming when they’re given the chance to simply shine, as with Cathryn Sherman’s mother who delivers the show’s strongest musical moment in ‘Isn’t He Something’, a misguided paean to preferring one child over the other. Elsewhere, the ensemble work is occasionally a little too unfocused, Thomas Michael Voss’ choreography not always organically connected to the material."
103,103,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2019,Ian,The Open, The Space,"With so much uncertainty surrounding what a post-Brexit Britain might actually look like (and with no sign of any clarity arriving anytime soon), the fertile imaginations of writers will have to do. And in the case of Florence Bell (directing her own play here too), it is a dystopian viewpoint in the shadow of Trump that persists in The Open.  It’s 2050 and the orange cheeto has bought Britain, converting it into The Great British Golf Course. Citizens have become golf caddies, entertaining the rich and famous, and any attempt at resistance is met with the severest punishment. Even so, migrant worker Jana wants to rebel against the authoritarian status quo and draws friends Arthur and Patrick into her orbit, despite the danger.
 Any number of ferociously contemporary and contentious issues are brought to bear here – the status of immigrants vs the ‘British’, notions of national identity and the other, social responsibility, encroaching state control of the media, the perils of a careless selfie… But The Open struggles to make them cohere, to fashion a narrative that engages and enthrals."
104,104,Ought To Be Clowns,19/05/2016,mag9l,Radiant Vermin, Soho Theatre,"Just a quickie for this return of a show that ranked 6th out of the 304 that I saw last year, Philip Ridley’s Radiant Vermin. Metal Rabbit and Supporting Wall’s production remains an absolute corker as it dissects the contemporary property market and all the societal baggage that goes with it in the most inimitable of ways. This revival returns to the Soho Theatre ahead of a trip to New York but finds itself in the upstairs space rather than the main house, which is a bit of a shame as it doesn’t work quite as effectively here, though ’tis only a minor quibble."
105,105,Ought To Be Clowns,11/06/2017,Ian,Operation Black Antler, Home,"The heart sinks a little bit when you get a reviewing assignment which ends with the request not to reveal too much about the production. You Me Bum Bum Train is the perfect example (especially as it was my entry into the world of immersive theatre) and looking back on it, from first to second to third time around, it is clearly a skill I had to learn (and am still learning). Which is all by means of building up to [not] talking about Operation Black Antler, a Blast Theory and Hydrocracker production running out of Manchester’s Home. In select groups, we’re thrown into the world of undercover surveillance on the streets of Manchester where we’re to “question the morality of state-sanctioned spying” – basically like an episode of Spooks if it were written by Paul Abbott and made by Channel 4.  As with so much open-air immersive theatre, much of the thrill comes from the unknown and the unexpected. Walking down streets, into busy pubs, nipping around dark corners, one’s expectations are challenged at every interval – is everyone in on it? can all these pedestrians and/or pubgoers actually be actors? Will you ever really get an answer?! Is this what life as an undercover police officer might be like, so full of suspicion and uncertainty. And that’s before you’ve even cracked into the meat of what is at stake in the operation itself. You’re cleverly pushed into the position of questioning how far is too far when it comes to security, what are the acceptable limits for government agencies to set, what happens when they exceed how far you’re willing to go as an individual. It is powerful stuff, and made even more poignant by the brutal reality of recent atrocities committed in the name of terrorism both here and in London. That situation was bravely alluded to at one point, sensitively handled even in the face of still-raw emotion."
106,106,Ought To Be Clowns,11/12/2018,Ian,Drip, Bush Theatre,"In events I can’t imagine being repeated anytime soon, I was the nominated ‘audience hunk’ for this performance of Drip., and far be it from me to review my own performance but never has a wind-chime been tinkled so beautifully… This kind of light-touch audience interaction is threaded throughout the show and really helps to set the mood of slightly bemused wonder. Tom Wells’ Drip popped up briefly in the library at the Bush Theatre last year, played Edinburgh over the summer and returns to W12 in the studio where its idiosyncratic charms prove well suited. A one-man musical, we follow 15 year old Liam as he makes a presentation to his school assembly in an attempt to win the annual Project Prize and more importantly, win back his friend Caz,  See. he was meant to join her synchronised swimming team but he can’t really swim. And now he’s making a musical presentation and he’s only just starting to write songs. It’s a neat set-up which allows for Matthew Robins’ deceptively simple songs to earworm their way into your head, and for Wells’ wryly observed but always heartfelt lyrics to really strike home in all their honesty.  The drama here may not be on an epic scale but it is no less affecting for its smaller scope. Refreshingly, Liam’s a sorted, out gay kid and as such, his concerns are any teenager’s concerns. Whether smoking looks cool, how to flirt when you’re not sure the fit boy reciprocates your feelings, how to get your best friend to talk to you again, whether anyone can pull off peach swimming shorts… "

And now it opens at the Soho Theatre as part of their Soho Solo season. Just for Laughs Theatricals’ production, skilfully directed by Kirsty Patrick Ward, is a one-woman show that took its inspiration from workshops with ex-offenders and an interview with the Michelin-starred Ollie Dabbous. Chef’s protagonist has had a rollercoaster ride of a life thus far – from salmon farms in the Shetland Islands to getting sucked into inner city gang life, from running her own top-class restaurant to heading the kitchen brigade in the prison where she has been jailed. Mahfouz and Anouka take us on every swoop and soaring rise of the journey – Mahfouz’s writing toying with linguistic convention, dipping in and out of verse on occasion, evoking a deeply poetic feel at times with expressive forays like “seagulls glide out of stalactite clouds” and then returning to a more prosaic style to allow Chef to explore her food memories as a route to keeping her sanity inside but also to help us navigate the events of her past."

109,109,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2011,Ian,The Heretic, Royal Court,"The Heretic, Richard Bean’s new play for the Royal Court, deals with the topic du jour taxing our playwrights, climate change, but takes a sharply comic take which provides a highly amusing evening and neatly sidesteps the gloominess which often permeates issue-driven theatre. Palaeogeophysics and geodynamics lecturer at York University, Dr Diane Cassell is treading a lonely path as a climate change sceptic, her findings are not convincing her that sea levels are indeed rising, which puts her in direct confrontation with her Greenpeace activist daughter and her department, as she publishes research and goes on (a highly amusingly filmed segment) Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman without permission, going against the wishes of her sponsor-hungry boss who just happens to be an old flame. One ray of sunshine for her is new student Ben who is receptive to her way of thinking and becomes her protégé whilst her world begins to crumble around her and death threats start to come in. By focusing on fully-fleshed characters rather than the issue per se, The Heretic for an engaging evening which is particularly thought-provoking in the first half as Bean questions the way in which science and politics are often forced together despite being uneasy bedfellows and looks at so many of the factors which surround the climate change debate that interact in a multiplicity of conflicting ways – this is more fun than it sounds I promise. I did like the way too the way in which humour is brought into every scene, the environmentally conscious security guard switching the light off, the way in which Bean skewers the bureaucracy around universities and HR departments everywhere and there are some seriously cracking one-liners peppered liberally throughout the show. The play is driven by a quartet of fantastic performances. It is such a pleasure to see Juliet Stevenson doing comedy, her deep dry tones are perfectly suited to the highly intelligent Doctor Cassell with her battery of withering put-downs and she of course plays both the encroaching fear for her safety and the unwavering love for her difficult daughter to perfection: Lydia Wilson bringing a nice bright-eyed charisma to her spiky yet sharply clever anorexic, so very much her mother’s daughter. James Fleet was great fun as her professor boss, unable to break free from the strictures of academic policy in reprimanding his wilful colleague despite sharing an intimate personal history with her which he is keen to pursue but Johnny Flynn was truly excellent as the awkward Earth Science student with his facade of lackadaisical and disaffected yoof which soon crumbles as he seeks intellectual stimulation from Cassell senior and a more physical stimulation from Cassell junior."
110,110,Ought To Be Clowns,17/06/2012,Ian,Democracy, Old Vic,"There’s apparently no predicting the way in which theatrical transfers work (apart from if we’re talking about Chichester musicals…). I can’t imagine the logistics involved in securing the necessary financial support, keeping the cast onboard and finding the ideal venue but perhaps more significantly, I’ve no concept of how the conversations begin. In some cases it seems a no-brainer, as in the aforementioned big-hitting Chichester musicals and indeed plays; in others, it seems easily misjudged, cf Written on the Heart;  and then there’s the others, in which a perfect confluence of factors enable a well-received production to make the relocation. It is probably the latter of these options in the case of Democracy, one of the three Michael Frayn plays that made up Sheffield Theatre’s celebration of his work earlier this year (Copenhagen and Benefactors were the others), which has now transferred to the Old Vic. On the face of it, it may not be the most appealing of prospects, a play based on real-life events in West German politics in the 1970s but what emerges is a sweeping spy thriller full of political intrigue and historical significance, which is all the more compelling for being true.   West German Chancellor Willy Brandt won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1971 for his efforts to achieve reconciliation between his country and those of the Soviet bloc but in 1973, his security forces received information that one of his closest personal assistants – Günter Guillaume – was in fact an East German spy and the eventual public revelation resulted in the end of his Chancellorship. Despite being hide-bound by history, Frayn cleverly suggests how such a turn of events might have come about with wit and lightness (for the most part) on the larger ideological level, but also brings a very human aspect to this tale of betrayal between two men between whom a strong relationship had formed. As Brandt, Patrick Drury provides a marvellous central presence to the play, a man ground down by the responsibilities of innovative statehood and the trials of holding together an antagonistic ruling coalition at a time of economic crisis (ring any bells?!). He’s also suffering from the personal demons of sex and alcohol addiction and depression on the side, so the steadying presence of Guillaume, who insinuated his way as unobtrusively as he could into the inner circle of power. Aidan McArdle demonstrates this superbly by turning himself into a super administrator, a trusty sidekick whose loyalties grow so strong that when the final axe falls, he is truly conflicted."
111,111,Ought To Be Clowns,03/10/2012,Ian,Our Boys, Duchess Theatre,"Director David Grindley’s first London job was as an ASM on the original 1993 award-winning production of Jonathan Lewis’ army hospital-based Our Boys so there is a pleasing circularity to him being the director of the play’s first West End revival. It is set in Ward 9 Bay 4 of the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital in Woolwich, with five soldiers at various stages in their recovery from injuries suffered in the line of duty who have their easy dynamic changed by the arrival of Potential Officer Menzies into the mix.  His presence shakes things up initially but he is soon assimilated into the group which kills the endless stretches of time with the recreation of barracks humour – strident banter that is close to the bone, searching for female company in want ads, illicit drinking games based on The Deer Hunter. But try as they might, they can’t escape from the ugly reality of their situation as their various torments rear their heads and it becomes apparent that this is a place where mental recovery is just as vital as physical recuperation. Lewis’ recourse to the class conflict caused by the arrival of POM feels a little bit dated in its construction and content, especially as the counter-intuitive casting of Laurence Fox as squaddie Joe, the natural leader of the group, suggests a more contemporary sensibility around social fluidity. But what does come across strongly, especially in the performances of Arthur Darvill and Cian Barry as Parry and Keith respectively, is the very real opportunity for escape, advancement, self-validation that the army offers for young men, disaffected or otherwise. The strength of the brotherhood that emerges as they help each other through personal demons is convincingly written and achingly well portrayed.   That camaraderie is severely tested as the mood darkens in the second half with loyalties being stretched to breaking point, and if the writing turns a little schematic in its neatness, it is more than redeemed by a killer final scene – Fox in truly scintillating form – that proudly wears its Purple Heart on its sleeve (to borrow a military decoration from across the ocean)."
112,112,Ought To Be Clowns,10/03/2012,Ian,Lay Down Your Cross, Hampstead Downstairs,"The Hampstead Downstairs has attracted an interesting range of creative talents since opening and with perhaps fortuitous timing, welcomes Nick Payne’s newest play Lay Down Your Cross. Payne is coming off the huge sellout success of Constellations upstairs at the Royal Court, but this is a much different piece of work – more akin to Wanderlust, my other experience with him as a playwright. We’re in Tony’s poky new flat in Luton where he is waiting for the arrival of his daughter Dawn, who has emigrated to Australia, as it is the funeral of his soldier son Adam. As we also meet his scatty ex-wife Grace, who’s all too keen on a box of wine or two, and Adam’s girlfriend Raph who is worrying about delivering the eulogy, Dawn gets to find out some uncomfortable truths about home, and her brother’s death. Payne excavates this troubled family dynamic extremely well: the emotional distance between them all, Tony’s struggle to shake his ex-wife’s dependence, his bluff demeanour having to hide his disappointment at the choices that his children have made, his lashing out when things get too much, all is excellently portrayed in Andy De La Tour’s persuasive performance. His quiet heartbreak is set well against the blinkered disintegration of Grace, Susan Wooldridge in fine form, but the play suffers a little with the shift into the blame game which comes with Dawn’s relentless pursuit of the truth. Lucy Phelps does well at signifying the righteous liberal anger but Payne absolves her, too easily for my liking, from the familial responsibility from which she has divorced herself and I wanted more resolution in this father/daughter relationship. Director Clare Lizzimore has gone for a hyper-real feel, especially when it comes to the food: so every time Tony offers a pork pie, he brings out pork pies on a plate which more often than not get eaten; the leftover food from the wake is cling-filmed up and nibbled away at as it should be; and we’re left in doubt as to how real the Indian takeaway is… Combined with some real hoovering (although left frustratingly incomplete) and proper projecting of a dvd, the detailing of the play is highly naturalistic in Will Fricker’s set. And this is matched by a set of four quietly powerful performances, chief amongst whom is Angela Terence’s Raph, the too-young girlfriend (and substitute daughter) who is beautifully funny (without realising it) and incredibly moving in a scene of sigh-inducing revelation. But whilst I did enjoy the play for the most part, looking back at it now I realise that there were a few moments where I didn’t quite get it at the time. This is quite possibly due to it having been a long week and so my concentration levels might not have been exactly what they could have been but I wonder too if there was perhaps a certain lack of clarity from the direction or the playwriting or both. I’d totally forgotten Tony and Grace were a divorced couple after about 20 minutes, and I think I misunderstood Dawn’s reaction to finding out the true circumstances about her brother’s death (she’d been lied to by her father) though I still found her to be a thoroughly objectionably selfish character. Looking at the fairly sparse crowd though (whilst entertained by the presence of Lady Antonia Fraser-Pinter) one has to wonder if the Hampstead Theatre’s approach to the Downstairs programming is proving entirely successful. The original raison d’être for the space spoke of being somewhere where theatre-making could be experimental and feel developmental free from critical gaze, but in reality we’ve ended up with a season that feels mostly rather traditional and quite akin to the Royal Court Upstairs – not that that is a bad thing at all – but the accompanying lack of promotional push from denying press reviews does mean that these plays can feel a little neglected and deserving of better audiences. Still, Lay Down Your Cross represents great value for money in seeing new writing from an interesting playwright and a high quality cast. I think Hampstead Downstairs' problem is that they don't seem to have any idea what their programming theme actually is, so neither does the potential audience: They claim to be experimental but have done nothing remotely unconventional since small hours – even if you just isolate Nick Payne, Lay Down Your Cross is a lot more conventionally structured than Constellations."
113,113,Ought To Be Clowns,29/01/2018,Ian,Hostage Hideout, Do Stuff Escape Games,"The set up is a hostage situation at a shopping centre which you find yourself in the middle of. And as ever, you’ve got to solve puzzles, find clues and dance a light fandango in order to save everyone and get out in time. It is all inventively done and with a keen eye on a real variety of challenges.  Crucially, it doesn’t take itself too seriously either, which makes it all the more to partake in. Though people’s lives are ostensibly at stake, there’s no danger of being made to feel stupid here which some of the more po-faced escape-the-rooms are in danger of doing. "
114,114,Ought To Be Clowns,28/03/2018,Ian,The Inheritance, Young Vic,"It would be easy to focus on the fact that The Inheritance is long and yes, its two parts total up to nearly seven hours in the thankfully comfortable seats of the Young Vic. But they also sum up to a brave and epic piece of new writing from Matthew Lopez, taking a scalpel to contemporary gay life in New York, asking what does it mean to be a gay man today and just how much of that is owed to an inherited (and neglected) cultural legacy.   Structurally, the play owes a curious debt to EM Forster’s Howard’s End, using it as a considerable inspiration for plot but also as a device to launch into its storytelling, which has an occasional tricksiness to it, pulling at the thread of the stories we wish we could tell rather than the ones we have to. That main story centres on Eric and Toby, a gay couple who have the foundations of their relationship rocked when the tenancy of their amazing apartment is terminated. As their lives reshape around new realities, new experiences, new challenges, they come to see how little of the world they really know.  Stephen Daldry’s direction indulges much of the girth of Lopez’s writing, giving scenes the rare elegance of real space to unfold, but also ensures a sense of pace which stops it from feeling interminable. So debates about surviving AIDS, or who does the most socially worthy ‘good’ work, or what it means to be a gay Republican are allowed to unwind intelligently without having to land too heavily on one side or the other. And there’s also a wittiness at play here too, as with the funniest incorporation of a Grindr beep you’ll see this year and a brilliantly staged sex scene. Bob Crowley’s set design is a masterclass in pure simplicity, a platform that rises and falls occasionally as if sighing. And at the risk of giving too much away, its reveals are a thing of beauty, lit gracefully by Jon Clark. Performance levels are off the chart – Kyle Soller is perfect as the kindly Eric (the one you want to take home to your mum), Andrew Burnap finds pathos in Toby (the one you don’t tell your mum about), and Samuel H Levine’s Adam has one of those journeys that just make the heart soar. There’s strong work too from a forthright John Benjamin Hickey, a late-appearing Vanessa Redgrave in all her aching fragility and Paul Hilton who pretty much steals Part 1 in what feels like a career-best turn."
115,115,Ought To Be Clowns,13/03/2012,Ian,The Glorious Ones, Landor,"The Landor Theatre in Clapham scored a major success with the Ahrens and Flaherty musical Ragtime last year and subsequently have begun to explore some of the lesser performed shows from their repertoire. February saw their first piece Lucky Stiff getting an airing and now it is the turn of their most recent collaboration from 2007, The Glorious Ones, in its European premiere. We follow a theatre group in Renaissance Italy as they ply their trade in commedia dell’Arte, enacting their ‘improvised’ scenes with their stock characters – from whom they are not so distinct any more – and so through these, we find out about their loves and lives as actors on the road. Flaminio Scala founded the troupe and is a master at the broad, bawdy comedy, but finds that tastes are changing as its crudeness is eschewed for a turn towards scripted theatre and younger players challenge his leading man status and struggles to deal with the change. Making his musical theatre debut in the lead role of Flaminio is Mike Christie, formerly of X-Factor popopera act G4, but it is a challenge that stretches him possibly a little too far. He’s underpowered in his vocal delivery both speaking, and surprisingly whilst singing, and he could afford to delve much more into the rakish charisma and dark moods of this figure. It also means his scenes with love interest Columbina are somewhat imbalanced as Kate Brennan’s beautifully buxom performance swells with personality and panache. But along with Brennan, the rest of the ensemble do a sterling job. Replacing the injured Peter Gerald, there’s an astonishingly accomplished turn from David Muscat as Dottore – whose second act number Rise and Fall is a highlight of the show – it’s incredible to think he has stepped in with just a few days notice as he seems fully at ease in the role (given his performance in the stellar Guys and Dolls upstairs at the Gatehouse, he’s most definitely going to be one to watch). And there’s also good work from Jodie Beth Meyer, Christopher Berry and a sadly under-used Peter Straker. Ultimately though, the show struggles to make sufficient impact due to its construction. The tableaux that are performed may call back to commedia dell’arte, but continually interrupt the narrative flow that there is. They maintain an air of tweeness, not particularly unpleasant but neither really conducive to the profundity the show reaches for in its climax. Musically, Flaherty does solid if a little indistinct work but lyrically, Ahrens finds little depth to accompany the bawdiness."
116,116,Ought To Be Clowns,30/09/2014,Ian,Shoot, I Didn’t Mean That / The Last Days of Mankind,"Much of the commemoration of the start of World War I that we have seen in British theatres has been from British writers so it is interesting to see that this double bill combines not only a classic piece of Austrian writing from the time but also a contemporary response to it as a result of a competition run by Time Zone Theatre and director Pamela Schermann. The result is a powerful look at the sad timelessness of global conflict that speaks as much to world affairs today as it does to the events of a century ago. Catriona Kerridge’s Shoot, I Didn’t Mean That was the panel’s choice and has a raw energy that sprawls occasionally as its three disparate story threads wind their way across the stage. Over there a woman is locked in an Austrian prison, just here two girls are chattering away and in the middle another woman is trapped in a box reciting bland political statements. We gradually find out that none are quite as harmless as they seem, no matter how innocent their actual intentions may or may not be, and Kerridge perhaps underplays this notion. As Nazis salutes, interruptions during the Remembrance Day silence and conflict tourism are thrown into the spotlight, it feels like a more strident interrogation of motivation is called for as opposed to the apologia that comes across here, though the energy in the writing is something to watch. The same company of four actors then move over to the inspiration for that first piece, Karl Kraus’ nightmarish The Last Days of Mankind, the expressionist epilogue of which is presented here. The apocalyptic vision here is markedly different – ensemble work, choreographed movement, linguistic complexity, dissolving structure, the horrors of war from the trenches to the officers’ mess to the newsrooms are presented in a continuous whirl, which rarely lets up to allow any self-indulgent posturing. Instead, a visceral response to what war does to society emerges, something Schermann emphasises with a topical filmic reminder to cap the whole evening off – heavy-handed perhaps but effective."
117,117,Ought To Be Clowns,20/10/2019,Ian,Art Heist, New Diorama,"Criticising Art Heist feels a little bit like kicking a puppy, such is the charm of Poltergeist, the young and effusive company who took this show to Edinburgh this summer. A slightly retooled version appears at the New Diorama but despite an abundance of that charm, it doesn’t quite stick the landing. Three art thieves all break into the same gallery at the same time to steal the same painting, while a security guard longs for a sandwich and the gift shop proves quite the distraction. To be sure we’re not quite in Ocean’s Eleven territory here, we’re not even in The Thomas Crown Affair… There’s a sweet daftness to the approach here. A narrator guides each of the thieves, provoking them to provide entertaining backstories, and an adroit use of technology offers an amusing shift in perspective. It is frequently engaging and fun and offers some neat bits of art trivia."
118,118,Ought To Be Clowns,13/11/2019,Ian,Mary Poppins, Prince Edward Theatre,"Strallens to the fore,

119,119,Ought To Be Clowns,23/04/2011,Ian,Lakeboat and Prairie Du Chien, Arcola,"Continuing the rather scattershot programming that is going on at the Arcola since its move closer to Dalston Junction, a David Mamet double bill of two rarely performed short plays, Lakeboat and Prairie Du Chien, from early in his career is playing in the smaller Studio 2, whilst Studio 1 is dark until Uncle Vanya arrives from Coventry. Lakeboat is set on an ageing cargo ship somewhere out of Chicago on the Great Lakes as English Lit student Dale joins the grizzled, heavy-swearing crew for the summer to replace the missing night chef, tales of whose disappearance are whirling around the ship. On the face of it, there’s perhaps not much to the play, but as a series of male character studies and the different ways in which men talk to each other, with all their braggadocio, masculine swagger, tales of sexual conquest and exertions of power where possible, it is highly illuminating. There’s some moments of great humour, usually concerning the most mundane of subjects, egg sandwiches or Clint Eastwood for example, but there’s also hints of darker places, sexual violence and intense loneliness. Steven Webb as Dale serves as the straight man for all the other characters with a brilliantly light wry touch and though everyone did well in the ensemble, Nigel Cooke’s plaintive Joe and particularly Rory Keenan’s handsomely beardy and fantastically filthy Fred were standouts. The second half features Prairie Du Chien, a much shorter piece set on a 1910 railcar making a scheduled stop on a long night-time journey: 2 men play a game of cards whilst another tells a haunting story to another passenger who is watching over his sleeping son. As The Storyteller, Nigel Cooke’s rich mellifluous tones make his ghostly tale of unfaithful wives and burning barns highly atmospheric and the way in which he works around the noisy interjections from the neighbouring table as the card game threatens to turn violent is perfectly played with small but essential contributions from Rory Keenan’s increasingly irate player and Nigel Whitmey’s dealer. Ed Hughes also did well with a minimum of words and a range of intent faces as The Listener but I couldn’t really see the economy in employing a different actor to play the largely wordless part of the son given we’d lost a couple from the first ensemble."
120,120,Ought To Be Clowns,28/11/2017,Ian,Barber Shop Chronicles, National,"A much welcome reprise for this extraordinary production of Inua Ellams’ Barber Shop Chronicles, a co-production with Fuel & West Yorkshire Playhouse which sold out its initial run at the Dorfman in the summer (here’s my review from then) and has already sold out this return engagement which brings back the original cast, ahead of a wee international tour when four new players, David Ajao, Bayo Gbadamosi, Martins Imhangbe and Tuwaine Barrett, will step in for Anthony Welsh, Fisayo Akinade, Hammed Animashaun and Simon Manyonda. That it is sold out shouldn’t stop you from trying to get tickets – there’s Friday Rush and there’s refreshing this page in case of returns, and boy is it worth it. Bijan Sheibani’s production does that magnificent thing of genuinely transforming the theatre into someplace else, someplace special, and the energy that crackles through every single minute of the performance – which starts from the moment you walk into the auditorium, this is definitely a show to be early for – is charged with the significance of these stories being told."
121,121,Ought To Be Clowns,30/06/2016,mag9l,Strangers In Between, King’s Head,        
122,122,Ought To Be Clowns,22/01/2014,Ian,Blurred Lines, National Theatre,"A dissection of “what it means to be a woman today”, Blurred Lines is a devised piece currently occupying the Shed, created by Nick Payne and Carrie Cracknell and the result of improvisation and experimentation with the cast of eight women. The show utilises text (effectively), poetry (interestingly) and songs (less than successfully) woven together into a patchwork piece of theatre. Naturally, the end result is somewhat uneven and it was hard not to feel that the almost scattershot approach mutes the overall impact of the work as the attention flashes from moment to moment.  For me, the strongest sequences were the ones bookending the show, which comes in at a snappy 70 minutes straight through. A roll call of the stereotypical depictions of women in the cultural sphere speaks with the unassailable truth that has undoubtedly dogged the careers of everyone here, reinforcing the narrative about the paucity of decent roles for women. And a blistering final segment challenges a patriarchal actor/director relationship, asking searing questions about what we all may have been conditioned to find acceptable.  Elsewhere, representations of women across a number of media flicker into brief life – the all-pervasive misogyny, the sexualisation of the standard portrayal of women (especially when playing ‘victims’), the compromises necessary just to get a job. And on Bunny Christie’s striking set of stairs, it certainly has a visual impact to accompany its thought-provoking story-telling. Marion Bailey as the theatre director is excellent at showing his appallingness, Sinéad Matthews is as punishingly effective as always at breaking one’s heart and I admired Michaela Coel’s spoken word work too. "
123,123,Ought To Be Clowns,07/08/2011,Ian,The Swan, National Theatre,"At the centre of everything is Jim, a bombastic performance from Trevor Cooper and blessed with some brilliantly inventive swearing, who claims to have been practically born in the pub where his mother was a singer and where he has ruled the roost ever since. Slowly but surely, more people arrive and the picture comes into focus as we come to realise exactly who the funeral was for and what his connection was to each of the characters. The deceased was no saint and so the day of the funeral is less about mourning and more about the piecing back together of lives that have been stifled by lies, alcoholism and deep betrayals. Over the scotch eggs, sausage rolls and Caribbean patties, truths that have long festered are aired and long-held assumptions are shattered as this extended family deal with the fallout in their changed world. Moore has a great ear for naturalistic dialogue, the rhythms of everyday speech, the difficulties many of us have in fully articulating complex emotions. And his characterisations reflect a similar strength in dramatising the normal, creating an empathetic figure out of the man who comes in to just escape his wife, played excellently by Richard Hope, and forming two great comic characters out of the dippy Bradwell mooning after his acerbic girlfriend Amy, a toxic delight from Claire-Louise Cordwell."
124,124,Ought To Be Clowns,15/01/2013,Ian,Three Sisters, New Diorama,"Though it was not particularly to my taste, Benedict Andrew’s radical take on Three Sisters for the Young Vic was a big success last year and so it is a brave company that takes Chekhov’s play on again so soon, not least in opening with a directorial choice which references it so strongly. It is the second play to open in The Faction’s 2013 rep season at the New Diorama after Schiller’s Fiesco, but where that play made imaginative use of the ensemble and sparkled with interesting direction, there’s not quite the same level of creativity at work here in Three Sisters, as this is altogether a straighter reading of a text. Ranjit Bolt has adapted the text quite considerably and whilst some may baulk at the contemporised truncations, I rather liked the colloquial ease with which it flowed through the trials and tribulations of the siblings trapped in their Russian backwater, determined but seemingly unable to prevent life from passing them by. Director Mark Leipacher keeps things relatively simple, utilising a set of kitchen chairs in a multitude of ways to suggest the rooms of the house that variously keeps them prisoner, offers a blanket that maintains their declining privilege and yet also forms a kind of refuge from the realities of the word. Kate Sawyer, Derval Mellett and Elizabeth Twells make an appealing set of sisters: Mellett’s wry humour as the acerbic Masha impressing and Twells essays the diminshing exuberance of Irina in a most thoughtful manner. But whilst the acting is never less than strong, the relative narrowness of the age band of the company results in a slight mismatch with the world-weary male characters, none of whom really seem old enough to have lived the hard lives against which they rail."
125,125,Ought To Be Clowns,20/11/2012,Ian,The Dark Earth and the Light Sky, Almeida,"“It doesn’t look like a poem, but it is”  This play’s ‘bout a poet called Ed
Edward Thomas his name ‘tis said,

And here we find out why. He wrote poems like Adlestrop,
But longed to serve though he was Pop,

126,126,Ought To Be Clowns,30/09/2017,Ian,After The Rehearsal / Persona, Barbican,"Toneelgroep Amsterdam have made the Barbican their base pretty much every time they’ve visited London, so it was little surprise that is where their 2017 residency was announced. We say residency, the peripatetic nature and ferocious workrate of this Dutch company meaning that it contained three shows spread over six months (Roman Tragedies, Obsession, and this Ingmar Bergman double bill) all of which have managed to provoke strong opinions. I’d be fascinated to know the reason behind choosing After The Rehearsal / Persona out of all of the shows in their considerable repertory (it also tours to Santiago, Chile and Washington DC). Created in 2012, it brings together two pieces written for the screen by the Swede into a long haul of an evening, close to three hours of occasionally impenetrable Swedish existential angst. It contains some of the directorial flourish that has made van Hove’s name, plus it stars the remarkable Marieke Heebink but there’s no denying I found it a challenge.  van Hove clearly has an affinity for Bergman (as evidenced in the truly stunning Scenes From A Marriage) but I have to be honest and say I just don’t know much of his work. So I can’t talk with any authority on the nature of the adaptations here, the debt owed to Strindberg, even simply where the faultlines might lie in terms of what didn’t work for me. (It’s been interesting though to see the divergence in which of the two pieces critics have preferred.) What I can say is that I was more a fan of After the Rehearsal with its meta discussion of theatre and how directors and performers relate to audiences. This tricksily enmeshed trio of personalities sparkle in the hands of Heebink, Gaite Jansen and Gijs Scholten van Aschat as the auteur struggling to draw the line between rehearsal and reality. Persona, featuring the same 3 plus Lineke Rijxman has a stunning design coup de théâtre but little else to reward. "
127,127,Ought To Be Clowns,31/10/2016,mag9l,Fool For Love, Found111,"And so the Found111 experiment comes to an end with this final production in the upper reaches of the former Central St Martins space. Emily Dobbs Productions has put together quite the programme of plays over the last year or so (The Dazzle, Bug, Unfaithful) with some astute casting decisions (Andrew Scott, James Norton, Matthew Lewis) bringing the buzz to the venue from the off. It’s not been unproblematic – its lack of access for one – but one of its issues has now been addressed with the introduction of allocated seating for the final play of this season. That play is Sam Shepard’s Fool For Love and once again the casting has a hook to it, this time reuniting Ripper Street Series 3 couple Adam Rothenberg (making his London stage debut) and Lydia Wilson as ill-fated lovers Eddie and May. He’s tracked her down to the motel room in the Mojave desert to where she’s escaped and he’s determined to whisk her back to life in Wyoming. But as they squabble and fight, we see that this is a dance that’s been played out before, their’s is the kind of love you can’t live with or without, they just keep on coming back for more. Simon Evans’ production makes the most of the physicality of their interactions, whether slamming bodies into bedframes or doors into the shaky walls of the motel, their torment inescapable. And watching over them is the lanky cowboy figure of Joe McGann’s Old Man, an imaginary figure who appears to them both and whose relationship to them speaks much to the toxicity, and indeed endurability, of their love. McGann revels in the lyricism of Shepard’s writing here, its exploration of this strange family dynamic in all its tragic depth."
128,128,Ought To Be Clowns,06/09/2015,mag9l,Miss Saigon, Prince Edward Theatre with TodayTix,"And I have to say that they’ve pretty much nailed it. The interface of the app is bright and easy to use (certainly it was on my iPhone6), there’s a wide range of West End shows available and the process of choosing and booking tickets at all price levels is simple and speedy with a little seatmap showing you where in the theatre your selected seats are. It really does streamline the ticket-buying process so that making any last minute decisions to see a show that much easier."

130,130,Ought To Be Clowns,04/12/2010,Ian,King Lear, Donmar Warehouse,"It was actually a genuine pleasure seeing such a play without knowing the plot, I was gripped in a way I’ve rarely been whilst watching Shakespeare as an adult and this tale of murder, malice, love, families, avarice, maiming, madness, deceit, remorse and so much death surprised me time and time again with its examination of human frailties. For those of you (and I don’t imagine there are many) who don’t know the plot, Lear is the aged King of Britain who chooses to abdicate and divide his kingdom into three to share amongst his daughters. But when the youngest refuses to make a public declaration of love and the Earl of Kent defends her, both are banished from the kingdom, leaving the older two daughters to inherit with their husbands and thus the seeds of treachery and revenge are planted as their ambition grows, throwing Lear’s world into chaos and threatening his very sanity. 
Compared to say, Hamlet, I was surprised at how action-filled the play is and the subsequent less reliance on soliloquy but there is no doubt that this is Lear’s story and as this troubled man, Derek Jacobi is just outstanding, gripping from the start as a cantankerous but authoritative leader to the intense vulnerability of his madness as a pastoral simpleton through to the painful recognition of his own fallibility at the finish as his faculties begin to return. The wails that accompany the realisation of the betrayals against him and his keening over the final death that precipitates the breaking of his own heart is just devastating and to see him as a broken old man is most affecting. But though it is a massively central role, Jacobi is served well by a superb ensemble, dressed in a modern-classical style, all variations on flowing black robes and gowns.
 
Gina McKee’s ball-busting Goneril and Justine Mitchell’s vicious Regan were both excellent in their cold manipulations and machinations, Tom Beard and Gideon Turner well matched as their husbands and I was also impressed by Alec Newman’s compellingly Machiavellian bastard son Edmund, working his way into the desires of both sisters. Gwilym Lee’s Edgar as his usurped rightful heir has a great vitality especially when playing the madman, Amit Shah is particularly noteworthy in the small role of Oswald and Michael Hadley as Kent and Ron Cook’s Fool provide supremely sterling support around their fading leader. The only minor thing I could point out would be Pippa Bennett-Warner’s quietly devout Cordelia, despite being well-played, really needs to work on her projection before opening night, she was far too quiet in the second act.
 
Christopher Oram’s sparse design has a genuinely transformative effect on the Donmar which is highly arresting and one which I hope can be transferred to all of the venues to which it is touring. Taking a bit of a similar cue from the Tricycle’s recent Broken Glass with a non-representational playing space suggesting (to me at least) a focus more on the internal drama and torment within Lear; the floor, walls, ceiling are all covered in a kind-of whitewashed wood panelling and left bare, creating a large amount of stage space within a cube. Props are at a bare minimum, a stool, a chair, a map of the kingdom is about the sum of it aside from the weapons, this is as intimate as epic theatre can get.
 
Grandage’s direction keeps the action moving incredibly well: there’s a kinetic energy that runs throughout, scene changes executed smoothly and swiftly with not a moment wasted, an incredible feat for a first preview really, but a canny choice to keep an urgency about the play which drives it forward. And as for the way in which the storm is portrayed, it almost defies description and the way in which Jacobi delivers in lines during this scene has to rank as one of the greatest things you will have seen all year.
 
Other reviews by more seasoned theatregoers will be able to tell you how this ranks in the pantheon of Lears, it is a role after all that is considered to be one of the great tests of our best actors (for better or for worse) but all I can offer is my take on what was to me a new play. I’m not sure yet if it is indeed one of the greatest dramas ever, but this production is stunningly good, more of a psychodrama than I was expecting and supported by an excellent ensemble, Jacobi really does confirm his place as one of our finest classical actors. totally disagree with what you have said about Pippa Bennett-Warner. I thought her performance was on the money and I could hear every word! Pippa wasn't speaking up any more on Saturday and we were in the second row of the stalls! Absolutely magnificent production though, Jacobi is amazing like you say and Michael Hadley's Kent is stunningly affecting. You should check out McKellen's Lear for the RSC on dvd, it is my favourite interpretation of recent times and quite different to this one. are you  kidding?!?! I was upstairs on saturday and could hear everything!! I think she did a great job. were you expecting her to shout every line?? It is not about shouting at all, but projection: it is not the same thing. We were in the stalls (I'm the second anonymous) and whilst her reunion scene with Lear was beautifully hushed it was just not audible enough. Compare it to Jacobi in the storm, she just needs to make sure her sound travels further Cripes! Anonymous #1, I don't think you mean that you totally disagree with me as if you read it, I praise Bennett-Warner's performance, it is just her audibility that was the issue. I am given to believe that playing this scene quietly was a choice that was made deliberately at this preview and has now since been discarded.  Whilst I accept that previews are times to let productions try out certain things, as a paying customer I do expect to be able to hear everything going on onstage and so I was a little disappointed that this hadn't been picked up earlier as it meant that I missed out on nearly the entire reconciliation scene between Cordelia and Lear. An eagle-eyed reader pointed out I omitted to mention Paul Jesson as Gloucester who also delivers a high quality, moving performance as the man manipulated by others and the victim of a horrific, and starkly mounted, crime. Of course, what no-one is saying that the colour-blind casting here really doesn't work…"
131,131,Ought To Be Clowns,08/10/2011,Ian,The Taming of the Shrew, Southwark Playhouse,"Robin Norton-Hale has been responsible for reinvigorating (or even inventing) the genre of pub opera with the wildly successful La Bohème, followed up by Don Giovanni this year and now turns her hand to Shakespeare with this adaption of The Taming of the Shrew at Southwark Playhouse. The modernisation sees us located in 21st century Brixton, the train map in the programme guiding us through stations such as Mantua Hill, Old Naples Road and Milan House allowing the Italian place names to remain in situ. And in Cherry Truluck’s cluttered market stall design, there’s a raft of amusing little touches: Katherine is first seen reading Margaret Attwood, Hortensio woos in his music lesson with a rendition of Mad World, Grumio serves up microwaved lasagne for dinner and there’s a mobile phone gag which is still making me chuckle now. But the updating is merely cosmetic in the final analysis, the text – although considerably trimmed and reshaped here – doesn’t really impose any new interpretative framework onto the play and so the problems that can be found remain, and in some cases are exacerbated. Times have changed (although some might say not enough) and so the story struggles to connect in the modern-day context: Katherine doesn’t need to get married and could strike out on her own whenever she wanted – the opportunities available now are worlds apart from the 17th century, the economic and social pressures just aren’t there and so the motivation behind her actions is not particularly evident in this production. Elexi Walker does imbue Katherine with a great sense of spiky character and a sensual physicality which is brought out by Simon Darwen’s über-confident Petruchio and they convince as a couple irresistibly drawn together, but once the ‘taming’ begins, the tone becomes rather confused. Walker wraps much of her speech in a wry sarcastic note which leaves the question of how seriously they are taking the whole thing frustratingly obtuse. Carried through to the final speech, this uncertainty just serves to highlight how difficult a play this is. The other main plot, of Katherine’s sister Bianca playing off her various suitors against each other, sits rather uneasily against this ambiguity. Where Katherine finds the need to react strongly against society, the precocious younger sister is more than happy to play the game, Simone James’ Bianca sucks on her lollipop provocatively and smears chocolate cake over her tutor, presenting another portrayal of feminine behaviour that feels questionable. There’s good work from Giles Roberts’ Hortensio and the double act of Will Featherstone and Simon Ginty, Lucentio and Tranio respectively, is most entertaining especially when they are impersonating each other."
132,132,Ought To Be Clowns,14/04/2019,Ian,Home, I’m Darling,"I don’t think she’ll win but I reckon Katherine Parkinson deserves the Best Actress in a Play Olivier just for the way that she holds her head. The first act in particular is an absolute delight as she tells us crystal clear exactly how she is feeling just by the angle at which it is tilted – cringing at bad language, sussing out competition for her husband’s attention, listening to her mother…    Parkinson is far from the only reason to book for Laura Wade’s Home, I’m Darling, maintaining the National’s track record of leveraging sell-out runs in the Dorfman into West End transfers (Beginning, Nine Night…).  Anna Fleischle’s design is a thing of wonder (and I liked getting to see it from above from the upper circle here as opposed to the Dorfman’s stalls) and every single detail is perfectly observed, right down to the milk bottle tops."
133,133,Ought To Be Clowns,09/01/2016,mag9l,Fear and Misery of the Third Reich, Union,"The title of Fear and Misery of the Third Reich might not seem like the most appealing at this time of the January blues but it is precisely this kind of complacency that Bertolt Brecht was cautioning against, and that Phil Willmott’s production for the Union Theatre highlights so effectively. Written by the playwright in 1938, this collection of inter-connected vignettes shows both remarkable insight into how prejudice and paranoia were manipulated to allow National Socialism to permeate all levels of German society, and an alarming prescience in how such behaviour might persist even today.  So in a series of scenes that jolt from farcical comedy to the darkest drama to pointed symbolism, Brecht takes us on a journey though the rise of jackbooted thuggery, overt anti-Semitism and bigoted political rhetoric. And the way in which people are browbeaten into submission – from the factory workers coerced into participating in fawning propaganda broadcasts to the parents anxious not to show their injured son too much concern after his release from a concentration camp lest they be reported for fraternising with the enemy – demonstrates the difficulties in trying to resist such a sea change, no matter how much one might recognise that it is wrong. John Willett’s translation keeps the darkly poetic rhymes of the narrator who introduces each scene (beautifully and emotively spoken by Pauline Quirke Academy-trained Joe Dowling) and with Wilmott, introduces the possibility of narrative strands into the play. So the worker (Joshua Ruhle) who spoke out in front of the cameras is the one who returns home bloodied and bruised, and Willmott’s Husband and Clara Francis’ Wife become the heart of the story – first shown fearing that their Hitler Youth camp-indoctrinated son has turned them into the authorities, Husband then returning as a judge riven by doubts and Wife, who is Jewish, later making the agonised decision to flee without her family.   Willmott and Francis play these scenes beautifully – his judge caught in the impossibility of satisfying conflicting demands at a time of shifting loyalties and her middle class certainties shattered by the untrammelled intolerance she experiences from friends and family alike as bridge partners and sisters-in-law distance themselves. There’s also powerful work from Feliks Mathur’s fervent paramilitary, drunk on the power of the fear he inspires, and from Ben Kerfoot and Tom Williams as members of the Hitler Youth, not quite as far down the same path but still a chilling warning of disaffected youth gone astray. "
134,134,Ought To Be Clowns,31/03/2014,mag9l,Eldorado, Arcola,"Sadly not a sequel to the escapades of Pilar and Marcus, this Eldorado is the UK premiere of Marius von Mayenburg’s 2004 play, translated by Maja Zade. It is also the first production by new theatre company Mongrel Thumb and it makes for an ambitiously bold opening statement, albeit one that is likely to have as many detractors as it does fans. von Mayenburg’s work is inscrutably European in feel (Fireface at the Young Vic is my other experience of him) and Simon Dormandy’s production can only do so much to open it up. Which means audiences at the Arcola will have to be, well, a little less British, a bit more adventurous in accepting von Mayenburg’s version of the world. His El Dorado is a modern day urban sprawl in which property is king, so much so that even though war is raging close by, investors are excited at the potential for building on the battlefields left behind. The rush for colonisation can’t hide the cultural malaise of a society on the edge of despair though, unhappiness manifesting itself in the strangest and most pervasive of ways – lobsters, cupboards, forests, piano lids. The characters may be connected – a property developer tries to deal with a slippery boss, his pianist wife teaches a young woman but is more preoccupied with wealthy widow of a mother and her flirtatious boytoy cum business partner. But they are thoroughly estranged, not just from each other but from the world that burns around them, disconnected from humanity and caught in an amoral hinterland. And this we find out from the abstractly poetic and wilfully obtuse writing, powerful imagery going up against lurid speechifying.  As a result, it has a rather sinuous rhythm, almost episodic in its nature as the ground beneath its feet shifts ever further from reality and then back again, as the human race is excoriated for its innate selfishness and the treatment of the planet. And though it may have its frustrating moments conceptually, there are some cracking performances. Amanda Hale breathes uncomprehending angst as the wife, Michael Colgan excels as the disillusioned developer and Sian Thomas glistens with monstrous wittiness as the self-absorbed matriarch."
135,135,Ought To Be Clowns,04/05/2015,mag9l,Eigengrau, Otherplace at the Basement: The Pit – Brighton Fringe,"The metropolitan loneliness epitomised by Penelope Skinner’s Eigengrau seems as appropriate in London-by-the-sea as it does in the London where it is set, indeed one can feel this alone anywhere. Cassie’s passion for her political activism continues to set her apart from others her own age, Mark has got money but is struggling to hold onto his mates, Tim is using his grief for his nan to avoid getting on with life and Rose, well she’s just struggling to reconcile her dream of true love in a world full of bastards and bills. As their paths variously intersect, they all reach out in the hope of connection, of finding something tangible in a city that never stops moving past them but life is never quite as easy as all that, especially when sex is thrown into the equation. And so begins the whirl of Skinner’s extremely funny play, given a solid production here by Hannah Joss which focuses on just how sharp the writing is as brutal truths follow amorous deceptions, and hopeless fancies turn into desperate actions. James Sheldon’s smoothly charismatic Mark is brilliantly seductive, effortlessly charming women into surrendering to their deepest desires, even if it compromises their very beliefs, and more than happy to accept an ill-advised offer of oral sex even whilst breaking up with someone. Annie Jackson’s committed Cassie is a sterling adversary, her banter with Mark is believably bolshy and underscored with real humour too, their scenes together form the backbone, and the highlight, of the show."
136,136,Ought To Be Clowns,27/04/2020,Ian,Take Me to the World: A Sondheim 90th Birthday Celebration,,"For me, I loved the unexpectedness of Katrina Lenk’ ‘Johanna’, the cuteness of Beanie Feldstein & Ben Platt’s ‘It Takes Two’, and the energy of Alexander Gemignani’s ‘Buddy’s Blues’. And of the heavy hitters in the finale, Donna Murphy and Patti LuPone nailed ‘Send in the Clowns’ and ‘Anyone Can Whistle’ respectively, and there’s huge fun (if not finesse) in Christine Baranski, Meryl Streep & Audra McDonald giving us their ‘Ladies Who Lunch’.    "
137,137,Ought To Be Clowns,02/10/2012,Ian,Private Lives, Minerva,"Is there anything left that one can say about Private Lives? That was my abiding feeling on leaving the final show in Chichester Festival Theatre’s 2012 programme despite having had an immensely enjoyable time. The show has proved to be one of Noël Coward’s enduring successes with productions continuing to regularly bless our stages – Kim Cattrall and Matthew Macfadyen brought it to the West End a couple of years ago – as they dance the timeless dance of irresistible couple Elyot and Amanda. The chemistry in Jonathan Kent’s production is palpable with the nigh-on perfect casting of Anna Chancellor and Toby Stephens. Chancellor, always a fearsomely good actress, brings a fulsome depth to bear which never lets us forget that there is a lifetime of love and loss that underlies all the comic business which occurs when the divorced couple meet accidentally on a hotel balcony, whilst both on their honeymoons with new partners. And Toby Stephens brings an unexpectedly delicious levity to his Elyot, public schoolboy through and through but charmingly warm too and both display perfect comic precision. They’re very well supported by their new spouses – Anthony Calf and Stephens’ real-life wife, Anna-Louise Plowman (who as it turns out, I still haven’t forgiven for being annoying beyond belief in Holby City…) – and Maggie McCarthy’s maid. It all looks a dream in the Minerva, thanks to Anthony Ward’s designs, and the overall impact is so good that one suspects if schedules work out, this could easily make the leap into the West End."
138,138,Ought To Be Clowns,18/08/2011,Ian,South Pacific, Barbican,"It will be interesting to see how many, if any, of the print critics make reference to one of the most significant aspects of the Barbican’s import of the Lincoln Center production of South Pacific: the ticket prices. The majority of the stalls is priced at £85, making the slightly restricted view seats a whopping £65 and you have to go up to the upper circle before prices start to drop. Not willing to spend so much, we went for the second-cheapest option, up in the balcony / gallery – £20 seats which were reduced to £16 with my membership – rather disgracefully the membership discount only being applicable to the first four performances, thus this is a preview being reviewed here. But credit where it’s due, the seats were just like the normal ones, comfortable with lots of leg room and you really are not that far away from the stage at all: it is so nice to find a venue with cheap seats that don’t take the p*ss out of the audience member and their comfort. But to the show. This was an extremely well-received production in New York, winning a handful of Tonys and running for 2 years, and so Bartlett Sher has sought to recreate its success for this engagement at the Barbican ahead of a UK tour, even bringing over three members of the original cast. There’s apparently 40 people in the cast (though I counted a few less) and an orchestra of 25 so words like lavish and breathtaking are being thrown around, presumably to mitigate for the pricing, though it is not evident that much investment has gone into the set design… It is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s most well known musicals, last seen in London ten years ago at the National Theatre but that was before my time here. Set during World War II on a naval base where US sailors are waiting to be deployed in the Pacific War, American nurse Nellie Forbush falls for expat French plantation owner Emile de Becque but their happiness together is threatened by revelations in his past and her inability to deal with them, but also the arrival of actual combat. And of course there’s the score, stuffed full of bona fide classic songs like ‘Bali Ha’i’, ‘I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair’, ‘There’s Nothing Like A Dame’, ‘I’m In Love With A Wonderful Guy’ and ‘Some Enchanted Evening’, it has a lot going for it. But I have to say, and caveats about previews repeated here, little of that was in evidence when I saw it. The production felt rather lacklustre throughout, lacking in energy across the board, but crucially missing the key ingredient of chemistry between its leads. Brazilian baritone Paulo Szot plays Emile with a richly gorgeous tone of singing voice but one which feels more akin to a concert – people were ‘bravo’-ing his songs one by one – as it doesn’t glide seamlessly into place with the production as a whole, matters further exacerbated by a concurrent lack of focus on actual acting. There’s a strong element of personal taste to this, I don’t like Alfie Boe for much the same reason, but good musical theatre to me is more than just a strong singing voice. On top of that, Samantha Womack as Nellie feels like a very strange piece of casting: her willingness to abandon the relative safety of a role in Eastenders to stretch her artistic wings is to be admired but I suspect this is a step too far. They end up making a strange couple, she has more of the acting chops than Szot but substantially less of the voice. Worse of all they are singularly lacking in any kind of chemistry together which robs the show of any kind of genuine emotion and without buying into their romance, what is left is not a pretty picture. Without the empathy for Nellie, the sympathy for her character that comes in the second half as a result of her racism feels so wrong; without feeling for Emile, there’s no sense of the tragedy of his decision – altogether, these emerge as difficult characters to care about but more importantly, not enough is done to make us care about their story. Sher’s direction is very much on the ruminative and restrained side of things, one could even label it as an attempt at realism, and this is a distinct attempt to mark this as something other than a ‘Broadway musical’ per se. Its stance on inter-racial marriage sets it out as an interesting piece of social commentary especially considering when it was written but as it stands, I just don’t think this approach works. This approach simply saps the life out of the production: ‘There’s Nothing Like A Dame’ feels rather flat, choreography being eschewed for a kind of co-ordinated movement here, but the straining for ‘realism’ is ridiculous in a song like this and so it doesn’t have the vitality it deserves. Likewise with the women’s number ‘I’m Gonna Wash That Man…’, there’s hints of what fun could be had with the number but all of them dulled with the lack of follow-through. Michael Yeargan’s set design underwhelmed, a cheap-looking beach stretching along the back of the stage, a naff-looking revolving platform for the talent-show stage and a set of panels dropping in to take us from military offices to French Colonial houses: only the airplane which appeared for a number really impressed. I can’t say I was much impressed by the supporting cast either: Alex Ferns made little impact as the cheeky Billis; Daniel Koek struggled to give his Lt Cable any discernible personality that might help us care about his plight and Elizabeth Chong is hamstrung by having nothing to work with as his love interest Liat. The saving grace of the production is the pleasure of hearing a large orchestra play the score so brightly under Ted Sperling’s musical direction. And original cast member Loretta Ables Sayre has fun with Bloody Mary, bringing a mystic air to her songs and the one character whose emotional outburst I was actually convinced by. But there’s simply too much that doesn’t work here to make this anything less than a crushing disappointment: more than anything, I just found this tediously dull (though it should be said this was far from the prevailing attitude in an otherwise largely appreciative audience). Absolutely agree with everything you said, particularly the comment 'a concurrent lack of focus on actual acting'.  I was so disappointed by it, especially after all the praise the New York production received. I can only conclude that it was far better in New York – here it felt flat, lifeless, emotionless and dull. Unfortunately, I had paid £65! Well that makes 3 of you that didn't like it and you've been tweeting each other about it saying the same thing and now two of you have posted reviews of a preview- why review a preview?? The other guy who posted a review of a preview also tweeted a complaint about the ticket prices just before he saw it, nothing like an open mind. Don't you think you may have been a little too influenced by the ticket prices? At least you acknowleged the rest of the audience really liked it, tweets have been overwhelmingly positive. And the part of Emile was written for an opera singer, there's nothing unusual about an opera singer in that role. If having a opera singer in a production really bothers you, you were never going to like this. And what the heck has your dislike of Alfie Boe got to do with it (isn't he out of opera anyway?) And the line is ""you can't light a fire when the wood's all wet."" Nellie's not singing about starting a forest fire! There is no mention of the word preview anywhere on the website for the show or the theatre or on any of the promotional material. In fact, 'anonymous', when I asked what the preview discounts at the box office were, I was specifically told that there were no previews for this show. So there's no reason why anyone shouldn't write about what they have seen, especially when they have paid for their own ticket. Your arguments are rather pathetic considering you simply object to someone not liking this show, I'm not hearing you defend any aspect of this production…is that because you haven't actually seen it??!!We saw it yesterday afternoon and left at the interval: woefully, woefully miscast and devoid of any of the emotion that the show needs to tell its story. Andy, are you the reviewer here or what? I had to hunt around through the Barbican's various press releases to even find out when the press night was, and there were no discounts for previews, so the ""don't review previews"" argument is invalid here. I was sitting next to the reviewer at this performance, and I agree entirely – a dull, lifeless production. A big disappointment, I was really looking forward to it. Thank you for your comments all. Anonymous #1 – I do think there's a certain level of expectation that came with it from the US and I wonder if there was a slight assumption that it would be easy to recapture the same magic – not everything transfers quite so easily across the Atlantic. Andy – I had heard the ‘no previews’ from someone else just today, something that is becoming increasingly the case with shows where they think they can get away with it. Sorry you left at the interval though (you might be relieved to know it didn’t get any better!) Rob – thanks for that too 😉 Anonymous #2 – thank you for the correction on the lyric, I’ve amended it now. Please treat other commenters with respect though, opinions are great things in that we can all have our own. As for your other points, here goes.– This blog is effectively my personal theatre diary: I review everything I see, when I see it. I had the opportunity to save money buying tickets when I did so I took it, that’s why this performance was reviewed. At the risk of starting up an old, and unending, debate, I do believe strongly though, that if £85 is being charged for a show, it is questionable whether the concept of ‘previews’ are really applicable: to my mind, it is close to insulting an audience to charge that much for something that isn’t considered ready. Also, would you have questioned my review had been it been more positive? I think the issue is more that I didn't love the show as much I suspect you do.– I believe that I did approach the show with an open mind: my issues with the pricing were dealt with a long time ago when they were first announced and in the end, as I say, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my seat so was in a much better frame of mind sitting down before it started than can have been reasonably expected!– Having never seen the show professionally before, so I didn’t have any preconceived notions about it all. I wasn’t aware it was a part written for an opera singer, nor was I aware that Szot was an opera singer rather than an actor: my point still stands though, this is a show not a concert, I expect acting as well as singing. The reason I mentioned Alfie Boe was because I had seen Les Miserables this week too and had a similar reaction – the focus being on his singing rather than the acting. Clearly lots of people are fine with this and that is fine, but this is about what I thought of it, and it just isn’t my thing at all. I would be very interested to hear what you thought of the show though, you are clearly a fan, and I do like to hear contrasting opinions to see what it is that others liked and that passed me by. We haven't seen the show, but we were certainly shocked at the ticket prices, and the claims that this is a Tony Award winning production when barely any of the original cast are in it.  Here's our take on it.  To be honest we are amazed so few others have picked up on the outrageous pricing.  As for opera singers, don't forget that Philip Quast, a highly respected musical theatre star, won a 'Best Actor in a Musical' Laurence Olivier Award for his portrayal of Emile de Becque – we're with Ian on this one. I've seen the show twice – one preview and again on first night. I loved it. Standing ovation both nights. Nuff said. I am going to see this for my birthday; am now wondering if it's not perhaps the best option?! Thanks for the warning, although I have heard reports of a triumph elsewhere.

139,139,Ought To Be Clowns,06/01/2012,Ian,The Heart of Robin Hood, Royal Shakespeare Theatre,"I don’t have any memory of booking The Heart of Robin Hood at all! But sometime late in November I did indeed book it and failed to put it in my calendar – I may well have been drunk, I most definitely was tired! – and it was only The Trainline sending me a reminder about the train journey that alerted me to what I should be indeed be doing this Thursday afternoon. The most impressive thing about the production, that is evident from the off, is Börkur Jonsson’s set design which has to rank as one of the most inventive uses of a thrust stage ever. A huge branch of a tree is suspended above a wide green swathe of astroturf which slopes from on high at the back of the stage, down into the auditorium. Thus the forest of Sherwood is evoked, with platforms and sections peeling back to suggest the castle of the nobles. It really is an ingenious piece of staging, endlessly delightful in the constant little reveals and surprises it came up with and even in the sheer fun of seeing people slide down into view from the top. With a set so full of creative opportunity, it is clear that Gisli Örn Gardarsson wanted a company that would be able to fully engage with his playful, physical aesthetic. And that is what has been assembled here as cast members tumble down from the sky, hang upside down on ropes for whole scenes, get plunged into pools, imitate animals, leap gracefully from platforms and clamber up the grassy verge with boundless enthusiasm. I loved the energy with which the cast conducted themselves, it felt entirely appropriate for a family show though some of the stuffier stalwarts of the audience in front of me weren’t quite so keen on getting snowed on or a bit wet! As the first figure onstage, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson’s bumptious bear Pierre was a delightful character of great warmth – I did initially think he’d be narrating the whole show but thankfully he soon returned back into the company – and he provided much of the comic relief of the show. Iris Roberts’ makes a spirited Marion, who seizes the opportunity to escape her intended nuptials to the nefarious Prince John – Martin Hutson in delightful form – by running off to the forest to join Robin Hood’s lawless band of bandits. When she sees that he’s no stuff of legends but rather just a petty thief – James McArdle playing the part of the handsome but morally questionable Robin very well – she disguises herself as Martin of Sherwood and sets about doing good in the forest thereby becoming the real focus of the play. Tim Treloar’s menacing Guy of Gisbourne and Flora Montgomery’s selfish Alice were also good fun, and there was a nice deal of brawny shirtlessness for the shallow-minded amongst us though rightly, it never felt sexualised to me. But for all the joys of the production, the play itself never really grabbed me. Weirdly, the story reminded me a bit more of Peter Pan than Robin Hood as we know it, David Farr’s revisionist approach forming a prequel of sorts and to my mind overplaying the Shakespearean allusions. The writing felt soggy at times, lacking the thrust I would have expected from a family show, though it must be said the children near me in the audience seemed largely engaged. So a mixed bag for me and I’m not 100% sure it was worth the effort of a trip to Stratford in the final analysis. And last but not least, I know you’re supposed to let your imagination run away with it, but a man crawling about and playing a clarinet does not a dog make!"
140,140,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,All About Eve, Noël Coward Theatre,"This isn’t the production to change people’s mind about Ivo van Hove. His style is so thoroughly ingrained, his team of collaborators so deeply embedded, that you couldn’t play a drinking game watching one of his shows and stay standing. Live video feed, drink! Backstage people wandering round, drink! A moody slow rise, drink! But what you also get is an amazing calibre of actor throwing themselves headlong into the work, ever-innovative ways of using theatrical space, and the kind of emotional intensity that remains rare. Drink drink drink! Now that we’re comfortably sloshed, I can tell you that I loved All About Eve (and I only had one G&T, honest). You’ll have to look elsewhere for critiques on how good an adaptation of Joseph L Mankiewicz’s film of the same name and Mary Orr’s play The Wisdom of Eve it is, I ain’t seen either and wanted to go into this sight unseen. What I can talk about is the startling insight offered by the actress’s-eye view, projected onto screens from a camera built into a dressing room mirror. About Gillian Anderson’s titanic performance. About Sheila Reid’s welcome return to the stage. About Monica fucking Dolan. There’s a welcome female dominance here – the film remains the only one in Oscar history to receive four female acting nominations – and along with Lily James in the title role, it’s refreshing (and still sadly all too rare) to see the scales tipped the other way given the most recent tenants of the Noël Coward Theatre. But whilst the story of untrammelled Broadway ambition here may involve more men than The Inheritance found room for women, it offers up a wickedly fantastic roles for Dolan as pseudo-narrator Karen, best pal to star actress Margo Channing – a glacial Gillian Anderson – who has to deal with the twin threats of Lily James’ scheming up-and-comer Eve, and also the crueller onset of ageing. And this is where the video work comes into its own, offering unsparing close-ups but also pre-recorded segments that toy with theatricality. Anderson’s Margo is full of bitter stings as she tackles the unfairness of showbiz, even society at large, but the predominant theme is the dawning of mournful acceptance, portrayed with an elegance that is beautiful to behold once it arrives. James is no less detailed in her work, a predatory presence on the edge of this world but only realising just how savage it is too late, once she’s scored what she thought was the prize. Stanley Townsend’s Addison DeWitt instrumental here in enforcing the kind of toxic power dynamic that still rings true with the influence of the likes of Harvey Weinstein and Ken Ehrlich. "
141,141,Ought To Be Clowns,17/04/2013,Ian,Table, National Theatre,"As the Cottesloe becomes the Dorfman, among other changes, the National Theatre has erected a temporary space called The Shed to keep a third working venue in their complex and opening the programme there, is this original play Table by Tanya Ronder. A family saga that stretches across several generations from 19thcentury Staffordshire to modern day London, taking in trips to hippy communes and East African missions, and with a rather gentle grace, it explores the way in which the actions of our parents impact on the people we become and how easy it is to irrevocably hurt the ones we love. It’s a densely told story, made more complex by a fracturing of the timeline which sees the focus constantly shifting between time periods, and it may take some getting used to. Rufus Norris marshals his deeply talented cast of nine, who cover thirty characters across six generations of the Best family, with a highly engaging playfulness but it does take a little time for the key pieces to come into focus and for the play to really coalesce into something affecting. But when it does get there, and it was the second half for me, its gentle energy and reflective charm make for a winning combination. The constant presence across the eras and the continents is the sturdily built table which bears witness to so many of the activities of this family and bears their scars: not just sharing food but lovemaking, group debates, playing games, hiding from varied threats including a predatory leopard. And the stories that emerge the strongest are of Paul Hilton’s Gideon, thoroughly dislocated and unable to shake the dysfunction that characterises so much of his life (Hilton also plays his father), and Rosalie Craig’s sweet-voiced nun whose life doesn’t go quite the way she planned."
142,142,Ought To Be Clowns,27/01/2019,Ian,Lola, VAULT Festival,"Hannah Nixon’s debut play Lola may take titular inspiration from Nabokov’s Lolita but it brings to mind Mamet’s Oleanna just as much, as it tackles the trials 18-year-old Lola faces in the daily act of going to college. The changes in her body are weighing her down emotionally and physically – she’s on a waiting list for a breast reduction – and they’re attracting all kinds of attention which she is struggling to deal with, most notably a boy who is stalking her. So she turns to two adult figures in her life, two of her tutors, but not even their help comes without strings. Jez is the kind of guy who revels in blurring the line between teacher and student, and Olivia lights upon Lola as a kind of project in which to put feminist theory into practice. As Lola’s situation becomes increasingly complex, the relationships between the three deepen into something dangerously entangled – who’d be a teenager?!"
143,143,Ought To Be Clowns,23/11/2015,mag9l,Glazen Speelgoed, Stadschouwburg Amsterdam,"Marking Sam Gold’s directorial debut outside of his native US, Glazen Speelgoed sees him do wonderful things to Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie with Toneelgroep Amsterdam, the Dutch company proving a perfect match for this striking reinterpretation. Released from the tyranny of the Southern accent (at least, I don’t think their Flemish was accented…) and though placed into a loosely contemporary setting, the production achieves a similar kind of timelessness to van Hove’s A View From The Bridge, the original recast and refreshed, new angles and facets accentuated in the glass.  Above all, the Wingfields have never felt so real, the family dynamic centred on Laura’s disability and her need for frequent physiotherapy. The ritual of massages and stretches reinforces the bond between mother-daughter-son, the intense feeling between them, but also the drudgery of their lives and the straitened circumstances in which they get by. Amanda’s need for gentlemen callers to propose to her daughter thus becomes a desperate strategy for financial security, the oppressive weight on Tom’s shoulders as the sole wage-earner in the household that much more powerfully felt.  Andrew Lieberman’s stripped-back design (right down to the bare bricks of this beautiful theatre) plays up both the realism and the privation. Props are condensed to a few key possessions and with Adam Silverman’s clever use of lighting, the precariousness of their position is perfectly exemplified by the blackout being complete. Silverman and Gold’s masterstroke is then to play the ensuing scene by candlelight, heightening the intimacy between Jim and Laura almost unbearably, the eventual neon glow from the Paradise Dance Hall sign channeling a real sexual charge into the shadows. 
Gold’s direction is full of other beautiful details, playful and poignant – the anarchic fizz of a can of pop opening announcing Jim’s introduction, Amanda’s worn green dressing gown clutched as if a safety blanket. The superb Chris Nietvelt invests her with such hushed humanity beneath the fussiness, her wistful reminiscences about her time in Blue Mountain heave out of her with a beautiful sigh; Eelco Smits’ emotionally bruised Tom is perfectly judged; and Harm Duco Schut plays up the devilishly dangerous charm of Jim, leaving Hélène Devos’ achingly absent Laura no choice but to be swept off her feet. Breathtakingly bold and intensely moving, let’s hope Gold’s next international foray takes him to the UK."
144,144,Ought To Be Clowns,12/11/2012,Ian,The Seagull, Southwark Playhouse,"Elements of the play sparkle under Reiss’ touch, in unexpected places. Emily Dobbs’ vivid Masha is a cracking portrayal of the disillusioned young adulthood that is the by-product of rural isolation, as she longs for the moody passion of Joseph Drake’s immature would-be playwright Konstantin yet finds herself resigned to the duller safety net of Ben Moor’s well-observed schoolteacher Medvedenko. And there’s a neat touch too in the Act 2 opening sequence that speaks so much about how deeply she can feel. But by contrast, the relationships at the centre of the play don’t impact anywhere near as powerfully as they should. Sasha Waddell makes a younger-than-usual Arkadina, Konstantin’s mother and an expansive extravagant actress whose retreats for the summer to her brother’s pile in the English countryside with her writer lover Trigorin, who finds himself taken by Nina, Konstantin’s lead actress and object of his own affection. Lily James’ Nina responds with an almost fangirlish admiration for his celebrity but her gaucheness is a little too emphatic, especially against Anthony Howell’s muted Trigorin who lacks a little of the charisma to make him a convincing pivot of so much romantic strife. The ensuing tangle of love triangles, jealous sons and frustrated artistic ambitions – Nina too dreams of a life on the stage – rarely flickers into compelling life as performances fail to mesh together, hampered by a script that too rarely allows for the complexity of these conflicted emotions and a bare staging by Jean Chan which feels rich in unexplored potential. The casting also feels a little curious in places. Malcolm Tierney’s frail Sorin seems a generation removed from Waddell’s Arkadina, rather than a sibling, though he has a dancing bright-eyed charm about him. But Matthew Kelly sounds all the wrong notes with a buffoonish take on the visiting Doctor Dorn which rarely convinces, though Reiss’ rewriting is also at fault here. Michael Beckley and Julia St John fare much better as the ever-present estate managers Shamrayev and Polina, full of wryness and warmth even in their brief contributions. But ultimately this is an adaptation which is rarely bold enough to really make its mark in a cluttered collection of Chekhovs, especially when we have been so spoiled in recent times. Whether it’s ostensibly traditional adaptations that excavate the Russian’s acute psychological depths, such as the Arcola’s incandescent take on Seagull last year or the Print Room’s extraordinary Uncle Vanya, or bold re-imaginings like Benedict Andrews’ Three Sisters (which I can admire whilst not finding it necessarily to my tastes), this is drama that can patently take a wide range of concepts. Reiss havers between these two schools though, a point reinforced by a note in the playtext about the setting. “The action takes place on the Isle of Man or wherever you will” so we’re caught awkwardly between the specific and the general: keeping original names and reference points in the text take us back to the motherland but the frequent mentions of the world outside relate to somewhere definitely closer to home. We’re clearly in a modern-day setting, yet Reiss makes no concession to the immensely different world in which the play now resides."
145,145,Ought To Be Clowns,25/02/2012,Ian,As You Like It, Digital Theatre,"Against my better judgement, I bought the RSC’s As You Like It ages ago when a special offer came up for it but it has languished on my hard-drive ever since as I have serious AYLI fatigue and no real desire to watch it again. It is one of those Shakespeares that seems to pop up with unfailing regularity and I’ve grown tired of it to be honest – occasionally a production will surprise with a stunning central performance as did Cush Jumbo at the Royal Exchange but usually I’m left weary by the lack of inventiveness in productions which end up blurring into one another in my mind. And that’s how I felt in the end about this 2010 Michael Boyd-directed production featuring the Long Ensemble. It is undoubtedly well-performed: Katy Stephens’ bright intelligence is perfectly suited to the determined Rosalind and well matched with Jonjo O’Neill’s passionate Orlando, Richard Katz’s wild-haired Touchstone is well observed and having become accustomed to this group of actors, I liked the smaller parts played by the likes of Christine Entwisle, Dyfan Dwyfor and Charles Aitken. But it was largely quite indistinct – little of the production remained in my head after I watched it, save the things that niggled me. How annoying Celia is, played a little too well by Mariah Gale whose stroppiness and insistence on playing the third wheel wasn’t entirely enjoyable; and I didn’t much like Forbes Masson’s Bill Bailey-esque Jaques, his music consequently feeling more like a delaying tactic than an integral part of his performance. And I’d forgotten about the rabbit skinning that caused so much kerfuffle when the play went to the US, to my mind it seemed most random and a rather unnecessary addition in the end."
146,146,Ought To Be Clowns,25/11/2012,Ian,Serjeant Musgrave’s Dance, Royal Court,"This rehearsed reading of Serjeant Musgrave’s Dance was held at the Royal Court in memory of its playwright John Arden who passed away in March of this year. I decided to attend as he’s not a writer I’m familiar with and the little reading I about him that I did in advance seemed to suggest that he’s possibly due a Rattigan-like revival. Though now apparently considered a highly significant British playwright, his work hasn’t really been in fashion in recent decades and his was a career marked with frequent clashes with the theatrical establishment which has possibly led to his oeuvre being a little neglected. The journey of the play Serjeant Musgrave’s Dance itself seems archetypal in this respect. It was received badly by both critics and audiences on its opening in 1959 but is now considered to be his best play and a modern classic. The process of exactly how something like this happens is something I’m very interested in discovering more about, (a short programme note explains the Royal Court themselves published a leaflet for audiences asking ‘What kind of theatre do you want?’ to get to the bottom of the issue) but on the evidence of this play, it is a little hard to see why it was not a success. Focusing on four Victorian soldiers who have deserted from an imperialist war somewhere overseas in 1879, this is a stridently anti-war piece of theatre. Thoroughly disillusioned with the whole concept of war after witnessing a terrible violent incident in which one of their comrades lost his life, the returnees turn up to a northern coal-mining town with a plan on their minds to seek revenge. It is a tad oblique at times, I overheard someone say Brechtian at the interval, but the writing has a sinuous power that felt remarkably pertinent as a warped sense of duty exacts a brutal toll. By the end, it was perhaps not so difficult to see why the play has a stronger appeal now. In a world where the role and activities of our armed forces are constantly questioned and scrutinised, and the impact of service on our soldiers much more examined, Arden’s writing seems eerily prescient of what we would now call PTSD, but might have seemed unforgivably daring to contemporary audiences. Peter Gill’s production here maintained a rather elegiac atmosphere though, and not just because of the bare bones of the staging of this reading. Folk music songs interspersed the action to take the show a remove from naturalism – multi-instrumentalist Anna Cooper accompanying with all manner of backing – and it all became rather moving."
147,147,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2016,mag9l,Hand To God, Vaudeville,"For someone who really isn’t a fan of puppets, I do see an awful lot of shows with them in. But I should clarify that I’m OK with more muppety types (hence loving Avenue Q and more recently The Lorax) and so I reckoned I’d be safe with the latest Broadway import to hit the West End – Hand To God. But whether its Avenue Q meets The Book of Mormon or Sesame Street meets The Exorcist, depending on which poster you read, its firmly adult nature is in no doubt. Harry Melling’s Jason is a young man grieving his father. His religious mother, Janie Dee’s Margery, has pressganged him into joining a church group but when he helps out with their puppet show, the consequences for all concerned are most extreme. As the sock puppet companion he creates, Tyrone, quickly becomes a conduit for all of Jason’s repressed teenage emotions, whether lust for Jemima Rooper’s downbeat Jessica or retaliation towards Kevin Mains’ bullying Timothy, the puppet takes on a manic life of its own. Thus the scene is set for all kinds of disruptive chaos and Robert Askin’s play – first seen Off-Off-Broadway in 2011 – revels in the increasingly puerile antics, as Tyrone does and says what Jason dares not, leading to some eye-blinking scenes of puppet coitus, the likes of which it is safe to say you probably haven’t seen before. And the liberation (of sorts) proves infectious, leading Margery to act out her bereavement too by scratching an itch with the horny Timothy. Moritz von Stuelpnagel’s production marshals his UK cast well: Melling is an unqualified success (and what a genuine thrill seeing his theatrical career blossom) as both sides of this severely split personality alive to all its comic potential but awake too to its underlying pathos; it’s a real pleasure to see Dee in such a unrestrained modern role and she connects well with Mains; and if Rooper and Neil Pearson as a pastor also keen on Margery are somewhat underused, it is good to see such strong actors on stage again. "
148,148,Ought To Be Clowns,20/02/2012,Ian,The Bomb: a partial history – Second Blast, Tricycle Theatre,"The second part of the Tricycle’s The Bomb – a partial history is named Second Blast: Present Dangers and focuses its attention on where the nuclear threat lies now, i.e. in the Middle East and North Korea. Alongside the five plays, there’s more of the verbatim reportage, edited by Richard Norton-Taylor, in this section, effectively deployed to demonstrate the almost ridiculousness of the way in which the debate about Iran and nuclear capability has been framed the US and Israel, and later on to remind us of the official political positions of many of our own leaders in the UK. Altogether I was a tiny bit disappointed with this half of the day (I’d’ve given it 3.5 stars as opposed to 4 for Part 1) as First Blast: Proliferation had cast its net far and wide to cover five different aspects of the history of the bomb but Second Blast returned time and time again to Iran (3 times in fact) in terms of the present day. Obviously it’s a massive part of where we are in terms of potential instability, but I felt that a more useful eye could have been cast elsewhere as well – in a savage indictment of those countries like Israel and Pakistan who still refuse to sign up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or indeed a more damning look at those countries that have signed yet show no signs of reducing their stockpile. As with the first part First Blast: Proliferation, I’ve written about each play separately, so click on the links for There Was A Man. There Was No Man by Colin Teevan, Axis by Diana Son, Talk Talk Fight Fight by Ryan Craig, The Letter of Last Resort by David Greig and From Elsewhere: On the Watch… by Zinnie Harris. Once again there was great delight in seeing the company stretching themselves in different roles: Paul Bhattacharjee probably wins for being amazing and incredibly hard-working, but Belinda Lang and Nathalie Armin run him a close second and there really were no weak links for me. Polly Sullivan’s simple design allows great flexibility and Douglas O’Connell’s video work was also used extremely well on the panels that divide the back of the stage."
149,149,Ought To Be Clowns,05/05/2019,Ian,Avalanche – A Love Story, Barbican,"I could listen to Maxine Peake read the phone book. A voice so full of warmth and character and unexpected texture, it somehow allows you to both sink into its soothing depths yet retain the capacity to catch you off-guard at any given moment. That dual capacity is powerfully deployed in Avalanche – A Love Story, Julia Leigh’s adaptation of her own memoir about her experiences in going through IVF. Over a 90 minute running time that simply flies by, Peake fills the stage of the Barbican magnificently.   Anne-Louise Sarks’ production adds only the ghosts of children into the wide space of Marg Horwell’s design, where Peake’s narrator recounts the experience of reconnecting with a old flame and deciding to try for a baby. He’s had a vasectomy and she’s in her late 30s but there’s always modern medicine isn’t there…"
150,150,Ought To Be Clowns,06/03/2010,Ian,Moonfleece, Rich Mix,"I had certain expectations of Moonfleece, largely influenced by the fact that the BNP had roundly denounced the play even before it had opened at Bethnal Green’s Rich Mix, which is virtually a recommendation in itself, and the opening scenes seemed to confirm them with a group of young men, all members of a far-right political party, converging on an abandoned East London tower block and attempting to turf out a mixed-race squatter. But as the tale unfolds, it becomes apparent that this is a tale of secrets and lies, of bonds between families and friends, and the way in which these can be manipulated to support an ideology, however extreme: the politics is in the background rather than the forefront. The meeting has been called by Curtis, the stepson of a Nick Griffin-like fascist political leader, in the tower block that was his former family home as he is being haunted by the memories and ghost of his older brother. He has asked his ex Sarah to bring a psychic friend Nina in order to conduct a séance to try and get to the bottom of things, but with her arrival comes a diverse group of her friends, including a gay student journalist, and a strident Indian best friend. Curtis is then forced to confront the major emotional crises of his life, namely the deaths of his father and brother and the circumstances that have led to him adhering to his stepfather’s party and its bigoted credo, throwing up the differences in his current friends, also party members, and the more liberal grouping of friends from his old life, surrounding his ex-girlfriend. And then there’s the squatters with a gift for storytelling, who has a story of particular significance to Curtis. The teenage ensemble do remarkably well with strong confident performances, each creating their own defined characters with ease, although many of them have little to do but react in the final third of the play when there is the sense of clutter on the stage. I was also a little concerned at the callousness with which Jason’s death was treated by some, but then perhaps that it what teenagers are like. Standouts for me were Emily Plumtree as the genuinely empathetic ex-girlfriend and Sian Robins-Grace as the flirtatious wheelchair-bound psychic Nina but the star is most definitely Sean Verey as Curtis. Playing a conflicted teenager I would have preferred to see more of the step-brother and fiancée, both late arrivals into the show, as they did seem more erudite members of the far-right group as it seemed a little easy to just have the verbal sparring with the less intelligent henchmen. And as impressive as it was, the climactic storytelling performance did go on a little too long: Verey did extremely well to pull the audience back with a heartbreaking final scene."
151,151,Ought To Be Clowns,09/02/2012,Ian,Sex with a Stranger, Trafalgar Studios 2,"It is always nice when a play can change your mind about a theatre. The Trafalgar Studios 2 has never been one of my favourite venues, its awkward shape and uncomfortable seating have often proved a challenge for directors and so my experiences there have definitely been a mixed bag. But Sex with a Stranger, written by Stefan Golaszewski who also pens Him and Her (not that I watch it), has slotted in extremely well with a cracking cast to tell its story of everyday disillusionment with love, sex and life. Adam and Grace hook up in a club and wind their way back to hers for a one night stand via the kebab shop and we get to see their attempts at halting conversation and forming a fumbling connection which are awkwardly, hilariously portrayed. We then skip back in time a day or so to find that Adam has left a girlfriend Ruth at home, but their relationship is no bed of roses and the stranger of the title could sadly apply to either woman. There’s no denying that this isn’t the most substantial of works, but interestingly enough where I would happily criticise say Ayckbourn for being insubstantial to my mind, the slightness here was much more tolerable because of the connection that I felt with the writing. So much of it feels relatable and recognisable and thus it rang entirely true with me, especially in its depiction of a failing relationship. It probably wasn’t an avocado that caused it, but I’ve had that passive-aggressive moment in the supermarket; that horrible pull between partner and friends who don’t necessarily get on; that nagging sense that neither of you are on the same page. Golaszewski captures all of this so well in its raw awkwardness and uncomfortableness, which is served excellently for once in the close intimacy of the Trafalgar Studios 2 in Phillip Breen’s production. The flickers of emotion, the briefest hint of expression, the tautness of the silences, nothing is hidden as the actors expose their character, flaws and all, in front of us. Jaime Winstone’s Grace has the bolshiness of a girl about town but great sensitivity too; Russell Tovey’s Adam has a lugubrious charm which belies the dark depths that threaten to bubble over; and Naomi Sheldon’s Ruth is given the most to work with as the woman clinging onto her relationship blindly at all costs, not quite able to keep the panic from her eyes. But such intimacy also works against the staging, the short bursts of scenes punctuated by brief blackouts are effective as a concept but in reality, the shuffling around of the actors is just a bit too evident. And I think it felt a little imbalanced in its portrayal of the three characters – where it should have been even-handed, Tovey’s Adam was featured a little more heavily and our sympathies directed a little too much towards him and not always deservedly so. He’s been working out considerably and so the scenes with him shirtless and hanging out in his boxers were definitely not difficult on the eye, but their number felt a little excessive (and tailored towards a specific audience…?); and there was the nagging sense that the female characters could have been a little more rounded, a little more fleshed out to remain genuinely persuasive from all angles."

153,153,Ought To Be Clowns,18/12/2009,Ian,Edmond, Wilton’s Music Hall,"Edmond saw a couple of firsts: my first promenade production and my first ever trip to Wilton’s Music Hall, the oldest and last surviving grand music hall in the world apparently: it is a venue that has only recently come to my attention with some interesting programming, indeed Fiona Shaw will be performing The Waste Land there next month. Sadly though, the hall is semi-derelict and fighting a losing battle to secure the funds to be able to keep it open and serviceable, a shame as it really is an interesting place. Marking Elliot Cowan’s directorial debut, this site-specific production of Edmond, David Mamet’s 1982 play, makes the most of its venue, utilising varying locations within the Wilton’s complex. Telling the story of a regular white-collar American chap whose meeting with a fortune-teller, who tells him “you are not where you belong”, sets him off on a journey through the seedy underbelly of New York city life, Edmond’s behaviour becomes increasingly erratic as less palatable sides of his character rise to the fore, in his search for self-discovery and redemption for his actions. Following from his turn in A Streetcar Named Desire, Cowan takes on the title role with aplomb (and some lingering hints of his ‘interesting’ accent from that show) but did extremely well to convince us of the hidden depths in this initially quite bookish-looking man. A selection of additional players did well in their multiple supporting roles and the use of a bluegrass trio, The Bonfire Band, was particularly ingenious as they provided excellent accompaniment, not least during the scene changes. Cowan’s decision to use the promenade format works extremely well on two levels: the play is quite episodic, with 23 short scenes, so it allowed for (mostly) quick scenes changes as we physically followed Edmond on his journey. But it also worked well in opening up Wilton’s Music Hall and showing the audience parts of the venue that you would never normally see, but also parts of the main hall itself that you wouldn’t necessarily notice during a traditionally staged event. It was a hugely fascinating tour which reminded you of the history of the building and how sad a loss it would be if it were to close. Limited to six shows, and 52 people per show, I feel particularly blessed to have been able to witness this great show, and I also feel Wilton’s would do well to use this production, or at least a similar format, in the future to show off its assets in such an interesting manner. Ian,I envy you for having been able to see the production and the venue.I was only able to take the virtual tour and yes, it would be a great loss if the funding for this building would fall flat.I live and work in theater in Canada and I wish we had any venues that were even close to being this old and had any of the character."
154,154,Ought To Be Clowns,10/04/2013,Ian,Jumpers for Goalposts, Watford Palace Theatre,"Some might cite Tom Wells’ new play Jumpers for Goalposts for its slightly fantastical air and lack of serious dramatic tension, but that would be to entirely miss the point of its warm-hearted yet clear-sighted pleasures. The play follows a predominantly gay five-a-side football team –Barely United – in Hull, scraped together from a selection of misfits and gradually unwinds to reveal their reasons for signing up and the impact that being part of this team has on their lives. But though it is gentle rather than grand, it is a hugely affecting and uplifting piece of theatre that feels vitally important from a writer who genuinely can find the extraordinary in the ordinary. In previous plays such as the tender Me, As A Penguin and the glorious The Kitchen Sink, Wells has demonstrated a gift for exploring the challenges of young gay life outside of the big cities and a serious talent for understated but highly comic writing and both are brought to bear here with great effect. Beardy Geoff splits his time between seducing the opposition and coming up with a song to win a talent show; head coach Viv wants to score revenge on the Lesbian Rovers team that kicked her out but also offer some respite to her grieving brother-in-law; and Danny, struggling to get through his coaching qualification, is entirely distracted by new arrival Luke, a painfully shy librarian. James Grieve’s production is impeccably acted across the five-strong company and captures perfectly the sweet-sharp switches of Wells’ script, as the wry observations of the comedy occasionally gives way to the darker truths of these characters’ lives. Viv’s forthrightness, given sparky life by Vivienne Gibbs, masks her own unacknowledged grief and the extrovert actions of Geoff, Andy Rush combining cocksure swagger with an adorable fragility wonderfully, can’t quite hide the lingering sorrow of being bashed. The plot holds few surprises ultimately but this writing sings with such freshness and clarity that you won’t whether to laugh or cry (you’ll probably do both)."
155,155,Ought To Be Clowns,09/06/2010,Ian,Like A Fishbone, Bush,"The timing of an opening of a new show is everything: later this week I’m going to the Tricycle to see Then and Now, their Women and Politics multi-part extravaganza at a time when the new cabinet has fewer women than ever so it feels even more appropriate. Such immediate relevance can be a double-edged sword though as Like A Fishbone, the new play by Anthony Weigh opening at the Bush Theatre about the memorialisation of a school shooting, comes less than a week after the tragic events in West Cumbria and whilst not directly connected, there were moments when it felt really quite close to the bone. Like A Fishbone takes its title from the Robert Lowell poem For the Union Dead referring to the memorial for the war dead in Boston as this play examines what is appropriate when it comes to dealing with the legacy of a tragic event. A leading architect has been commissioned to create a memorial for the victims of a terrible crime, all the children of a village murdered in their schoolhouse, and she is preparing to unveil her work to the public. When a blind woman somehow makes her way into the office where the model of the memorial is being kept ready for delivery, the scene is set for a confrontation between the two as it turns out she is the mother of one of the children who died in the attack. They then challenge each other about what constitutes a fitting monument to the dead, what it means to be a mother and the relative merits of clinging onto faith over the stark acceptance of the brutal truth. It’s heavy-hitting stuff, almost claustrophobic in its one room, real-time setting, but genuinely thrilling. Seeing Deborah Findlay here, after Jenny Galloway in After the Dance last week, means I have now seen each of the women involved in the somewhat unfortunate Madame de Sade and can safely say that they’ve all escaped unscathed! I find Findlay to be one of our most under-rated actresses, equally at home in costume dramas, she is one of the formidable ladies of Cranford remember, as she is in modern dramas, Torchwood, Silent Witness and State of Play come to mind straight off, and it is the latter mode that she is in here. As The Architect, she is all expensive fabrics, statement necklaces and carefully streaked hair as the carefully poised, ultimate career woman. Findlay’s performance here is by and large stunning: as the dispassionate Architect, obsessed with architecture although we didn’t get to see the poster of Centrepoint(!) and approaching the commission from a pure design point of view with startling results. Her relentless drive to validate the memorial, but almost as importantly the process around it, is utterly believable and the moments when she verbally attacks The Mother for her obstinacy and her faith having regained her equilibrium after the initial shock of the intrusion are just searingly painful to watch. There’s a brilliant natural feel to her delivery of Weigh’s language too, the constant slips between her corporate script about the project (the word stakeholders brings me out in shivers at the best of times) and the emotive language forced out of her by the confrontation. The last time I saw Sarah Smart was in The Line where she bared her breasts in front of me for what felt like a lifetime so it was quite ironic that her opening scene here was played with her back to me for about 5 minutes. She is excellent though as the working-class Mother, out of place and intimidated at first by The Architect’s grandstanding but slowly unfurling her real strength as she peels back the verbosity and uncovers more about The Architect than she would ever care to admit. The emotional centrepiece of the show is her discovery of the model, seeing her feeling her way through her own village and telling her story of that fateful day is just absolutely harrowing. The confrontation between Findlay and Smart percolates beautifully throughout the show as the balance of power constantly tips between the two, their frequently overlapping dialogue rising to an intense ferocity from time to time as each tries to push the buttons of the other and it really is engrossing to watch. There’s something of the psychological thriller in their battling and a genuine uncertainty about the way things are going to play out. Elsewhere, Phoebe Waller-Bridge provides some great comic relief as The Intern who pops in and out, overly eager to please her idol and delightfully gauche in her interactions with The Mother, nailing perfectly the unease that people have when newly coming into contact with someone with a disability. Lucy Osborne’s design has a brilliant conceit which I am going to spoil here, so if you want to be surprised, then skip to the next paragraph now. The play takes place in a single room but they’ve built a false wall complete with windows into the theatre which provides the opportunity to create effective illusion of rain falling outside."
156,156,Ought To Be Clowns,05/10/2014,Ian,Four minutes twelve seconds, Hampstead Downstairs,"Fresh from the news that a Hampstead Downstairs show will make its West End bow in the New Year (the excellent Di and Viv and Rose) after being the first to make the in-house transfer to the main theatre, the Autumn season in this officially critic-free space (I paid for my ticket, £5 early bird deal ftw) opens with James Fritz’s Four minutes twelve seconds. His first full-length play delves into the murky world of revenge porn, where an explosion in smartphone usage plus the abdication of responsibility enabled by the freedom of the internet has resulted in one of the more pernicious innovations of modern times. At 17 years old and about to sit the exams that will hopefully send him off to a good university, Jack seems to have it made but when he comes home from school one day with his shirt covered in blood, all that is set to change. Initially trying to pass it off as a nosebleed, then a set-to with some kids from the rough school over the way, we soon find out who is responsible and why they’ve done this – a video of Jack and his girlfriend Cara getting jiggy with it has appeared online, only she’s not his girlfriend any more and so it looks like Jack has been trying to get even with her. Of course, it is nowhere near this simple and Fritz plays into the uncertainty of the mood by never letting us meet Jack, instead we see everything through the eyes of his parents Di and David as they battle through general disbelief, parental protectiveness and liberal do-goodism. The play’s most interesting section comes in this split between doing the right thing for their son and doing the right thing per se, the divide in where they see their responsibilities lying being endlessly thought-provoking and the lengths that each parent will go to to achieve their aim dramatically most satisfying indeed."
157,157,Ought To Be Clowns,06/11/2013,Ian,An Enemy of the People, New Diorama,"The works of Henrik Ibsen are often cited as some of the greatest committed to paper but though his plays are frequently performed, they are rarely adapted, seldom excised from their 19th century Norwegian settings to explore how they might resonate in a more contemporary context. David Harrower had a go at putting Ibsen into the 1970s with Public Enemy for the Young Vic earlier this year but Rebecca Manson Jones has brought the same play – An Enemy of the People – bang up to date with this new adaptation which is now playing at the New Diorama Theatre after a tour of London and the South West of England.  She places the play in a modern-day but fictional small town on the Cornish coast – Porth Kregg – which is finding its way out of economic depression through a co-operative owned health spa, run by the Stockmann siblings. But when the ethical business ethos of one is compromised by the environmentally unsound supplier found by the other, the convictions of all concerned are challenged as the whole community is forced to identify what they consider to be more important – the health of the planet versus the weight of their purse. And it’s a question that we as the audience are also asked to contemplate, in a way that shapes the play itself. The play does take a little time to set up its conceit, the opening scenes of issue-driven debate a little too broad to connect intimately with the overload of information which extends to handouts being given as one takes one’s seat. But as the pieces begin to settle and the key characters emerge in well-defined relief, Manson Jones’ adaptation casts a magical spell which drives it through to its multiple-choice ending. Sarah Malin’s vibrantly charismatic Thomasina – recently returned from doing ‘good’ in Africa – is a compelling ethical champion and Rupert Holliday Evans is the perfect foil as her pragmatically-minded, small-town politician brother, eventually in the opposite corner. The post-interval Town Hall meeting where the Co-operative gather to thrash out their response to the crisis is excellently conceived – additional performers scattered throughout lending a ramshackle energy that frequently feels thrillingly on the verge of being out of control. And as we are all asked to vote on the proposed motion, the finale is guided by our response with two possible endings on the cards, the ensemble thus showing great flexibility but the playwright also demonstrating to us the difficulties of maintaining utopian democratic ideals in face of contrary public opinion."
158,158,Ought To Be Clowns,10/12/2013,Ian,The Shape of Things, Arcola,"What price art? How far and fearlessly should one be allowed to pursue artistic ambition? The arguments may recall the more recent debates to try and protect the arts in the never-ending rounds of funding cuts in the name of austerity but they also form the basis of Neil LaBute’s 2001 play The Shape of Things, first seen at the Almeida before making it to Hollywood and revived here by Samuel Miller in the gloom of the Arcola’s basement Studio 2. It’s a play to see unspoiled if you can, the plot hinging excellently on its grand reveal. Suffice to say that there’s more than meets the eye to this tale of Adam and Eve – this Adam is a scruffily nerdish art gallery, this Eve(lyn) is a modish art student who picks him up in the middle of a protest against a sculpture he’s meant to be watching, and their Garden of Eden the relationship that thus blossoms and sees him transform almost beyond recognition. The serpent though is human nature itself, in all its self-regarding vicissitudes and viciousness. For try as they may, neither can escape their innate selfishness as they are sucked into the vortex of their journeys, heedless of the collateral damage to anyone, including Adam’s friends Philip and Jenny who are drawn into the drama. LaBute acutely observes the cult of the superficial that reigns supreme in contemporary culture and the late discussion about the nature of art is certainly persuasive. This production lacks a little of the necessary depth to really make this most of acerbic of writing fly though. Takis’ striking design of a dominating bright blue torso, which dissembles into the furniture for the subsequent scenes, is well-conceived but results in an awful lot of shuffling around in the pace-sapping scene changes. And Anna Bamberger’s Evelyn doesn’t quite nail the irresistible charisma needed to make her the driving force of so much change, crucially missing the sexual charge with Sean McConaghy’s Adam."
159,159,Ought To Be Clowns,10/07/2012,Ian,St John’s Night, Jermyn Street,"Written early in his career in 1852, Ibsen’s play St John’s Eve (or St John’s Night as it has been retitled here in this translation by James McFarlane) was so poorly received that it was brushed under the carpet somewhat and not even included in his collected works. Following on from last year’s successful version of another neglected Ibsen piece Little Eyolf, director Anthony Biggs returns to the Jermyn Street Theatre to see if lightning can strike twice by giving St John’s Night its UK premiere. This may have been a preview but for me, I’m not so sure that it did succeed, instead reminding us why some plays are left to collect dust. This is very much an example of the playwright-in-progress , being unlike any other Ibsen play that I know, as it is a fairy-tale comedy, taking influence from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream but putting a decidedly Nordic spin on it. The play is set on a Norwegian farm whose ownership is unclear after the death of Mr Berg. Berg’s second wife lives in one house and is trying to secure the inheritance for her daughter by finding a good marriage and she invites her chosen victim Birk, with two of his friends, to join in their midsummer revels. Berg’s ageing father and naïve daughter live in another, older house on the estate which happens to have a resident goblin upstairs and when the young people decide to take their party up to a mystical hill, the goblin – a Puck-like figure – spikes their drink with a potion that unlocks all sorts of hidden memories. James Perkins’ design impressively reinvents the limited space of the Jermyn Street to neatly suggest these two varying properties and the pastoral charm of a summery Norwegian hillside, even providing a nook for the household goblin – Luke Bateman – to play his own composed music which twinkles and undulates most atmospherically throughout the show, the waterphone used to prefigure the goblin’s actions is particularly well chosen. But there’s an uncertainty of tone in the rest of the production that limits its effectiveness. Some performers appear to be in something of a farce, whilst others are much more serious in tone and the disparate elements have yet to marry in a way that convinced. The mystical fairy-tale ambience, hinted at from the beginning with a nightmare-inducing (for me at least) puppet-like creature, is rarely allowed to flow as Ibsen’s writing is mainly concerned with matters of romantic Norwegian nationalism and how it should properly be conceived and this tension is something that recurs as Biggs’ production skitters from mood to mood. Louise Calf’s earnestness as the goodly Anne is appealing, especially as she connects more and more Ed Birch’s Birk whilst his intended Julianne, Isla Carter whose exasperated charisma I rather liked, grows closer to Danny Lee Wynter’s aesthete Poulsen, a difficult role. David Osmond has a great foppishness as Jørgen, a character whose presence in the play is sadly, largely quite superfluous and Sara Crowe is rather wasted as Mrs Berg, again hampered by the lack of clarity about character."
160,160,Ought To Be Clowns,24/06/2015,mag9l,Bend it like Beckham, Phoenix,"As anyone who has ever been to my parents’ annual Bonfire Night party can attest, a good aloo gobi is nothing to be sniffed at (nor my mum’s lamb saag for that matter) but when you’re a teenager, such things are far from your mind. So it is for Jesminder Bhamra – her older sister has just gotten engaged, her parents are keen for her to keep close to her Punjabi Sikh heritage but all she wants to do is play football in the park. And when she gets spotted by the captain of the local girls’ team, Jess finds herself torn between her family and following her heart’s desire. Based on Gurinder Chadha’s enormously successful film of the same name, this musical version of Bend It Like Beckham is a ball-bouncing, cross-cultural match-up of a show. Adapted by Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges, the story maintains its vivacious energy as Jess weaves her way through wedding prep and vibrantly staged parties with the extended family whilst tackling the rigours of life with new pal and teammate Jules in the Hounslow Harriers where her footballing prowess is soon spotted by the keen coach Joe, someone else Jules also has her eye on.  Chadha’s direction is most at home when evoking the communal life of the East African Indian diaspora through the gift of music – from bhangra routines to delicately moving folk songs, Aletta Collins’ choreography and musical staging is superbly done. And there’s clear indications too of the tension in forging a modern identity, Jess’ sister Pinky wants to do everything the ‘right’ way to honour her parents but has to keep her pre-marital dalliances with her fiancé a secret and her engagement party dance owes as much to Pineapple Studios as it does the Punjab – Preeya Kalidas here is an electric presence throughout.  Howard Goodall’s score, enhanced by co-orchestrator Kuljit Bhamra, is a beautiful thing, fusing his inimitable soaring and swooping melodies with subcontinental influences to create a beguiling mixtures, full of recurring motifs and reprises which fix themselves in the mind. And Nigel Lilley’s musical direction is sprightly and sure-footed, ensuring the cast recording (should there be one…) will be well worth the investment, not least because there’s a substantial amount of it. The show is undoubtedly too long – sequences become repetitive, longueurs let the attention waver and the story rarely justifies the length. This is in part due to the footballing scenes being weaker, the ball skills and physicality of the female ensemble are a cracking tribute to the England World Cup quarter-finalists (so far) but the various ways in which actually kicking a ball are simulated just don’t work despite the best efforts of Natalie Dew, who makes a brilliantly empathetic leading lady as Jess and Lauren Samuels as the sparky Jules."
161,161,Ought To Be Clowns,29/04/2010,Ian,Debbie Reynolds – Alive and Fabulous, Apollo,"Making her first UK appearances since performing at the Palladium in 1974, Debbie Reynolds arrives at the Apollo theatre after a short UK tour with her one woman show, Alive and Fabulous. Accompanied by her longtime pianist (25 years together and counting) and drummer, she revisits her long and eventful career encompassing motion pictures, television, Broadway and Vegas shows and encounters with some of the biggest and brightest names ever to grace showbusiness. And what stories she has to tell. Ranging from her colourful marriage history, to tales of quiet days with the children round at Judy Garland’s place, the anecdotes fly at us like sequinned bullets. On more than one occasion, the anecdotes are half-told as she whips through them a tad by rote and she flits onto the next one or a song with breathtaking speed. I guess this is part of the problem in trying to make a show feel fresh when the same old stories are repeated night after night and she did have lots of fun adlibbing and interacting with the audience much to the stalls’ delight. There’s also a few impressions, a great Katharine Hepburn and a wicked Barbra Streisand were my favourites and a couple of nods to her recent small screen success as Bobbi Adler in Will and Grace. With such a vast musical heritage to revisit, Reynolds often resorts to medleys of numbers in order to get as many songs as possible in. This is employed to brilliant effect in the first half with a montage of songs from some of her early movies played on a large flatscreen, with a spotlight on her as she sings along to her screen image. Later medleys include a Gershwin collection presaged with a lovely ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ from the piano and a show-stopping Judy Garland selection, which if nothing else proves that Debbie should be Dorothy! However, these are also slightly frustrating as it means that we don’t get more than a snippet of each of the songs, there’s a tantalising section of ‘S Wonderful that I would have liked to hear more of and approximately a 90 second clip of ‘The Man That Got Away’ that is hands down the best moment in the show and it was just heartbreaking as she quickly segued into the next number. These were minor quibbles though in what was a splendid evening of great entertainment. Ms Reynolds is such an engaging performer and winning raconteur that I can’t imagine that anyone would have left disappointed, and indeed the rush to the front of the theatre to shake her hand as she took her bows was faster than any audience member managed at the end of Hair, despite the average age being somewhat higher! Going on Sunday. Can't wait now. Andrew was fortunate enough to go to the Debbie Reynolds museum in Las Vegas before it went bust. EVERYTHING in the gift shop was signed. He still has a signed bottle of mineral water in the cupboard. Seriously. We went last night (Thurs) … it was an excellent evening. 78! amazing energetic performer It was my first experience of the one-woman retrospective cabaret bonanza so I had little to compare it to, but I can really say that I loved it. Signed mineral water eh? I bet it has healing properties, hehe. You may jest but a visiting friend with kidney stones in great pain held it to his body and was never troubled by them again. True story."
162,162,Ought To Be Clowns,02/12/2009,Ian,The Priory, Royal Court,"Following on from the mammoth successes of the over-rated Jerusalem and the equally highly praised Enron, The Priory has a lot to live up to in maintaining the Royal Court’s current run. A new play by Matthew Wynne, it follows a group of 30-something old friends as they convene on a country house to celebrate New Year’s Eve away from the rat race. Brought together by their mutual friend Kate for reasons of her own, secrets are uncovered and tempers flare as the frustrations of modern living are brought into sharp relief and the question of ‘what is success’ is repeatedly challenged. Jessica Hynes’s Kate is the emotional centre of this work. Sifting through the emotional detritus of a highly traumatic year, her search for some kind of meaning is what drives the play. Whether its seeking refuge in the company of old friends, the solace of an old love or the temptation of a new faith, Kate’s attempts to deal with her angst seem doomed to failure, and her loneliness, even when surrounded by others is heartbreaking to watch: I found Hynes to be utterly convincing in this part. 
She is ably supported by two fine performances by Rachael Stirling and Charlotte Riley. Stirling’s self-satisfied Rebecca is a high-flying career woman and yummy mummy and hysterically indiscreet with the feelings of her friends, trampling around with the subtlety of a bull in a china shop, all the while demanding undevoted attention to the every detail of her childrens’ lives. And Riley’s relative inexperience compared to the rest of the cast is scarcely noticeable in a great turn as Laura, the outsider in this group, desperately trying to ingratiate herself into her new fiance’s circle, the “I’m a friend of the gays” scene is particularly well-played and her deterioration as the night continues was painfully and gorily effective. I found The Priory to be sharply written and acutely observed: it’s as funny a new play as I have seen in a while, with some excellent character acting on display. And whilst it may not have dealt with larger themes of its predecessors, I think there is something to be said for a play that focuses more on the minutiae of daily living, something that should resonate with everyone."

164,164,Ought To Be Clowns,09/10/2010,Ian,The Country, Arcola,"The Country, by Martin Crimp is another collaboration between the Arcola Theatre and Iceni Productions (last year saw them do Mamet’s The Shawl) but actually marks the first time I have seen a Crimp play. I have seen plays that he has translated but never one of his original works so I was intrigued to see how I would react to this rather polarising playwright in his own words. But there was another reason I wanted to go, as the building is being converted (into luxury flats, what else) and so the Arcola is on the move. Although not too far, to the Colourworks building (which is next door to the Printhouse where I used to work) right by the new Dalston Junction station, but change is most definitely afoot and I wanted to make sure I make the most of its current set-up as it has been one of my favourite venues to visit in the last couple of years. The play follows a middle class family as they relocate from an urban lifestyle to one in the countryside. Richard is a doctor and Corinne a housewife but their domestic quiet is shattered when he brings home an unconscious young woman late at night. For Rebecca, as we find out her name to be, is much much more than just a stranger and her arrival provokes an unravelling of secrets from the past and uncertainties in the present as her presence forces a reassessment of the turmoil that we now see in beneath the paper-thin façade of this marriage. And I have to say I found it completely gripping. Given how oblique much of the writing is, so much is left unsaid and left for us to infer, I was hooked from the start. The prose is full of silences and repetitions which echo resoundingly and ominously as we slowly being to discover some of the reasons behind the move to the country and Richard’s behaviour, but there’s no tidy resolutions here but rather a tantalising sense of the compromises that are made in the name of maintaining the status quo. Amanda Root is sensational as the quietly desperate Corinne, she manages to communicate volumes with just her eyes in an often heartbreaking manner and she remained utterly believable throughout. And I also enjoyed Simon Thorp’s masculine Richard with his dry delivery, every word weighted heavily with mystery and together, their chemistry was electric: I could have watched them talk all night. Naomi Wattis did well as the American Rebecca, the cat amongst these pigeons, fully aware of the power she could wield over this couple but equally unable to conceal her own vulnerability. Anna Bliss Scully’s design is excellent, a sparsely furnished set, with it and the audience surrounded by trees which are eerily lit by Richard Williamson, it really does enhance the ambience of discomfort and general creepiness which is just right. So highly recommended, not least because it will be one of the last opportunities to see yet another inventive use of the Arcola’s current space and some high quality acting up close. It’s a real shame they have to move but there’s also the sense of opportunity that comes with change and a new beginning so if you feel inclined to support this exciting theatre with its innovative approaches to abolishing its carbon footprint, then please do so by visiting their website and helping out. I think the new venue will be a great opportunity for them, especially with the greater spaces for their associated work too."

166,166,Ought To Be Clowns,28/06/2015,mag9l,One Arm, Southwark Playhouse,"Tennessee Williams’ One Arm started life in the 1940s as a short story, was turned into a screenplay which remained unproduced in the 1960s and now finds itself adapted into a stage play by Moisés Kaufman, receiving its UK premiere directed by Josh Seymour at the Southwark Playhouse. Champion boxer and serving in the American navy, Ollie Olsen life is turned upside down when he loses his arm in a car accident and turning to prostitution, finds himself sucked into a world of increasing darkness and ending up on death row. From his cell, he reflects on his life and the strange contours of its journey. Kaufman is perhaps best known for The Laramie Project (which Seymour directed in Leicester in 2012) and elements of that patchwork approach remain here, as this play has snippets from the screenplay quoted directly, including scene transitions and settings, upping the metatheatricality around Ollie’s story. But as it progresses, this device loses prominence amongst an increasing sense of Ollie’s fevered dreamworld taking over, allowing Seymour to bring out more of his own theatrical vision as with the incorporation of John Ross’ movement. With the short running time here though, such innovation feels a little too much like imposition on the storytelling. And when Williams is being as unusually and gloriously frank about homosexuality as he is here, there’s a real poignancy and power to a lead character openly embracing his new-found competence in the oldest profession and also to the array of men seeking not just sex but solace in the arms of another man, in if he’s a rent boy. Naturally these gents flick in and out of the narrative but one longs for at least some of them to linger a little while longer."
167,167,Ought To Be Clowns,10/09/2014,Ian,Reptember – Triple Bill C, New Diorama,"A second trip this week to Reptember at the New Diorama saw me take in another of The Faction’s triple bills after a strong start with programme A. For me though, programme C didn’t quite hit the same mark with its collection of solo performances. Whether connected or not, these were all new pieces for me so I wonder if that lack of familiarity played into my mindset. Additionally, it didn’t feel like there was quite as much directorial innovation at play here, previous work from The Faction having raised the bar in terms of expectation. So with Aeschylus‘ Prometheus in a new version by Will Gore, director Rachel Valentine Smith has Faction AD Mark Leipacher up a stepladder, bound there by the dark deeds and secrets of his past but though it makes for an arresting initial image, the static nature it enforces on the piece leaves it feeling a little flat. Like with Borkmann, adapted by Leipacher from Ibsen’s John Gabriel Borkman, Alexander Guiney’s self-flagellating banker never managed to capture my imagination as he addresses the empty chairs that represents the family he’s let down."
168,168,Ought To Be Clowns,22/10/2011,Ian,The Last of the Duchess, Hampstead,"The Hampstead Theatre continues its trend of featuring plays concerning real people with The Last of the Duchess by Nicholas Wright, which is based on the book of the same name by Lady Caroline Blackwood detailing her attempts to secure an interview with the Duchess of Windsor towards the end of her life in 1980 to complete her literary profile of her. But though it is Wallis Simpson who is at the heart of the issue, the central figures are her lawyer Maître Suzanne Blum who staunchly defended her client from any outside influence or visitors with something of a siege mentality and Lady Caroline Blackwood herself, commissioned by the Sunday Times to interview the reclusive Duchess but also battling her own personal demons. This was the second preview so feel free to disregard everything written here if you are so inclined. The play focuses on the battle of wills between these two women as Caroline senses a scoop in the mysterious atmosphere that permeates this Parisian household, intrigued by this powerful figure who now completely dominates the life of the Duchess and sees an opportunity to tell the story a different way. Anna Chancellor plays the disheveled aristocrat beautifully, determined to unravel the mystery she begins to uncover but barely able to keep herself from unraveling too, the glass of vodka that is never far from her hand failing to keep the turmoil of her personal life at bay. And in the other corner, Sheila Hancock exudes a Gallic imperiousness as the fiercely protective Blum, her every breath inexplicably dedicated to protecting the legacy of her employer and clearly relishing the power of attorney she now possesses, yet even she cannot resist the lure of a moment in the spotlight, becoming increasingly susceptible to the overtures to have herself interviewed and photographed by Lord Snowden instead. There is huge pleasure to be had from watching these two fine actresses at loggerheads on stage as they each try and figure the other out and how best to deal with them, but it is Angela Thorne (mother to Rupert Penry-Jones no less) who steals the show with her appearance as Lady Diana Mosley, one of the Duchess’s closest friends yet even she cannot get past Blum’s formidable barriers, who brings her own tales of intrigue of missing pieces of jewellery which add to the mystery. Wright’s version of Mosley is highly amusing, if a little heavy-handed on reinforcing her prejudices, a grande dame of a society that no longer exists and Thorne delivers a portrayal of great humour. There’s also a nice turn from favourite-round-these-parts John Heffernan as Blum’s factotum/pupil Michael Bloch, with something of a fetish for demanding women and an endearing desire to please (though not with his wardrobe…) though ultimately possessed of the most common sense out of everyone. The title of the play is actually ends up being something of a misnomer as it sets the initial attention in the wrong place, something played up to by Wright and director Richard Eyre in the dream-like first scene in which Caroline meets a younger Wallis Simpson. For this piece is less about the Duchess herself or even the mystery of what has actually happened to her – is she being kept prisoner by Blum or has she even perhaps died – but rather about more ephemeral subjects which swirl around each other. The main one seemed to me to be about the art of biography and whether it is ever possible to really capture the ‘truth’ of someone through any medium, whether poetry, paint or pen. As a muse to several artists, Lady Blackwood has much experience of the unspoken contract between artist and subject – Chancellor excellent in putting this across – yet Maître Blum has been the soul of utter discretion as a lawyer to a whole raft of famous people whom she has sworn never to talk about and so is unable or unwilling to submit herself fully to Caroline’s questioning. This would perhaps also force her to face up to the strangeness of her relationship to the Duchess which is left unresolved, an obsessive kind of love – at one point she imitates a pose of the Duchess’s by the mirror – but also a deep respect in trying to keep the legacy of a woman involved in one of the greatest scandals at the time free from smears and gossip: Hancock always keeps us guessing which is closest to the truth. But it’s also about fragility, of memory, of life, of this particular time in society and how we deal with these things differently. There’s a gorgeous moment where Ladies Mosley and Blackwood sit next to each other on the sofa and talk from the heart, both unhearing of the other, Diana about the pain of seeing her husband slip away from her in life and Caroline about the enduring anguish she feels at the death of her own husband, from which she has yet to fully recover. This is counter-pointed by the recurring hints that Maître Blum is all too aware of her encroaching mortality, a particularly poignant moment sees her explaining away a linguistic mistake to Michael, a desperate attempt to save face in front of her pupil, to maintain this impassive facade even to someone who has managed to get relatively close to her."
169,169,Ought To Be Clowns,18/04/2013,Ian,Othello, National Theatre,"
Where the fireworks do come is from the acting though. Adrian Lester may possibly be a little too young and downright handsome for Othello (I’d love to see him tackle the role in 10 years time) but he attacks the verse with an exciting directness, all bold primary colours. And this contrasts marvellously with the much greater subtleties of Rory Kinnear’s Iago, his palette demonstrating many shades and textures but above all a malevolence that is all the more frightening for clearly coming from a place of fierce intelligence. There’s something of a mischievousness about him too, garnering more laughter than one might have expected from this play from an audience who seemed oddly determined to find as much of it as funny as they could.  Hytner gathers a strong cast around his leads and one which feels pleasingly diverse rather than being entirely populated by NT stalwarts. Jonathan Bailey (I’m guessing he didn’t kill Danny Latimer…) makes a vibrantly persuasive Cassio, a passionate (would-be) career soldier; Tom Robertson’s Roderigo is all Chelsea loafers and no socks, a civilian interloper in this military environment; and Olivia Vinall’s fresh-faced naïveté works a treat for this Desdemona, oblivious to the dangerous swells around her and ultimately almost as much an intruder as Roderigo. 
 
I was a little ambivalent about Lyndsey Marshal’s Emilia though, cast here as one of the soldiers on the base. Except she is rarely allowed to be a soldier as the demands of the role mean she is constantly having to trot off stage holding Desdemona’s hand and offering comfort instead of doing her job in the military corps which more or less makes it a pointless amendment. And since I bought so utterly into Alexandra Gilbreath’s revelatory interpretation of the role in Sheffield, there’s a comparative lack of any great detailing in Emilia and Iago’s relationship here, no sense of history, no reason to believe this modern woman would kowtow so easily to his demands. Marshal does deliver the anguished feeling of the final scenes with a brilliantly raw torment and it’s not her fault that my only other Emilia was by one of my favourite ever actresses in one of the best performances of last year."

171,171,Ought To Be Clowns,28/11/2018,Ian,A singalong Bat out of Hell, Dominion,"Just a quickie for this repeat visit to Bat out of Hell, as the allure of the singalong performance was once again too strong. I don’t know if Tuesday night was the best choice though, as the Dominion Theatre was lacking in bodies and in atmosphere, at least in our part of the stalls, which kind of detracted from the communal spirit which was so enjoyable last time around. I wonder too if the news of the show’s closure has dampened some of the enthusiasm. As D-day (5th January) draws closer, some of that intensity might return but for me, the performance level was weaker than I’ve previously seen. Rob Fowler and Sharon Sexton carry the show even more now and that means you only feel their absence all the more when they’re not on stage. Nothing really rocks, nothing really rolls… "
172,172,Ought To Be Clowns,10/01/2020,Ian,Six the Musical, Lowry,"It’s not too often that I get to go to the theatre with my whole family, so a festive trip to the Lowry to see Six the Musical was a definite treat over Christmas. And to see it from the front row too…quite the experience. I’ve seen the show one and a bit times before so I knew what to expect, but the thrill of being that close really did make a difference (even if I was convinced that Katherine Howard was going to kick me in the face at some point or other!). And it was great to see all 10 of us really enjoy ourselves, grandparents to grandkids (and me the middle child, what else?!). Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss’ anarchic history – sorry, herstory! –  lesson has lost none of its effervescence or energy in this touring version. It helps of course that it is a relatively lo-tech show to run but it has clearly settled well in Salford for this Christmas sojourn as it was packed out and an extra week has been added to the schedule too. Naturally, I loved all six performances equally. But I do have to say that Lauren Byrne has a simply gorgeous voice as Jane Seymour (I don’t envy anyone trying to match her ‘Heart of Stone’ at the singalong) and I kinda fell in love with Athena Collins (Catherine Parr) who has the kind of fabulously warm stage presence that will definitely make me watch out for what she does next. We were blessed with Jennifer Caldwell’s Anne Boleyn, as ever, go #TeamAlternates. As well as providing a welcome opportunity for performers to really cut loose, Six also – sadly – remains at the cutting edge of the zeitgeist. As film award season swings into gear once again with its age-old celebration of the male, pale and stale, there’s something inspiring about the deserved success (Broadway beckons in a couple of months) of a theatrical story forefronting female voices this way, written by a queer man and a woman, pushing at the boundaries of convention. Don’t miss out. "
173,173,Ought To Be Clowns,05/04/2013,Ian,The Hospital at the Time of the Revolution, Finborough,"Unperformed since it was written in 1972, it has fallen to Urgent Theatre company to make the case for Caryl Churchill’s The Hospital at the Time of the Revolution in this limited run production at the Finborough Theatre, directed by James Russell. And concerned as it is with the ethics of torture and how it impacts on those that carry it out, as well as its direct results, it still carries a currency with modern audiences despite being set in an Algeria still fighting for independence from its colonial power France.  Churchill used the work of noted psychiatrist Frantz Fanon, namely The Wretched of the Earth, to come up not only with a script that cycles through a number of agents in a psychiatric unit – a civil servant and his distressed family, a sleepless soldier, a snide colleague, a group of patients – but also utilising Fanon himself as a central figure, the doctor to whom they all look to cure their various woes. But it is clear that serious damage has been done, violence perpetrated – whether physical, emotional or cultural – and justified in the name of various causes.  Russell’s production is somewhat hamstrung by having to perch onto the set of another show as is the way with the limited runs at the Finborough and consequently has little room to use in the already intimate space of this theatre. So scenes play out in a rather static manner, tiringly so as they are revisited, and the one really potentially interesting innovation – to have the one true victim of torture represented by a lifesize puppet – is never really exploited to its full potential.  Instead, he relies on the intriguing qualities of his cast, several of whom deliver strong performances. Ruth Lass’ fussing mother is devastatingly blinkered as along with her husband played by Kenneth Price, she struggles to deal with their near-catatonic daughter Françoise – their familial relationship a microcosm of the corrupting delusions of the colonial mindset; Benjamin Cawley’s patient has a highly affecting monologue about the vicious cycle of violence freedom fighters get stuck into; and Simon Yadoo is compelling as the policeman who is struggling to reconcile the requirements of his job with his daily life. "
174,174,Ought To Be Clowns,22/11/2009,Ian,The Line, Arcola,"The ever-flexible space at the Arcola has been converted into an artist’s studio, with canvasses strewn all around the walls which gives a great sense of atmosphere and there’s furniture placed in the centre of the stage, representing the drawing room in which much of the action takes place. It is staged in the round (or more accurately the square) which is largely effective, but does prove slightly problematic towards the end as Valadon shows some of her work to Degas and so it is only displayed to one half of the audience. As the ageing Degas, Henry Goodman gives a cracking performance full of irascibility and a real sense of great devotion to the pursuit of his art, at the expense of all other human comforts. His physical changes as the years pass are utterly convincing, culminating in an amazing scene as he traverses the streets of Paris. Sarah Smart brought a delightful sparkiness to her developing artist who struggles in negotiating the fine line between pursuing her own art in the way she wants to, whilst trying to remain faithful to the memory of the traditions that her mentor holds so dear. She’s also having to balance this with her dogged survival in society as a mother and woman of low birth. The most surprising performance for me though was Selina Cadell’s Zoé: as Degas’ housekeeper, she was a tower of quiet strength, often spending entire scenes watching in silence, but acting just as much anyone else onstage. There’s an air of resignation about her as she’s fully aware that she will not go down in history despite being Degas’ rock and working just as hard as he does, she’s an artist in her own right too."
175,175,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Zoo, VAULT Festival,"Well who would have thought it? A show that actually manages to make brilliant use of the Cavern, one of the most awkward of the VAULT Festival’s spaces. Co-directors Hamish MacDougall and Lily Bevan have clearly thought about how to maximise the potential this restaging of Zoo (previously seen in Edinburgh and at Theatre503), and make full and creative use of its echoing length – a real achievement. It helps that Bevan’s play is one which lends itself to a letterbox-ish format. She plays Bonnie, a zoo keeper at Cherokee Valley Zoo and Conservation Centre in Miami and as a hurricane winds its way towards Florida, we also meet Lorna Beckett’s Carol, a North Yorkshire bat enthusiast and see how a friendship grows between the two women, sustaining them through some pretty harsh times, including meeting a man called Ian… "
176,176,Ought To Be Clowns,24/06/2017,Ian,Terror, Lyric Hammersmith,"Using a gimmick to cover the business of reviewing the play….?  😉

Being fascinated by the concept of Ferdinand von Schirach’s drama much more than its actual execution? 
Loving the work of Tanya Moodie too much? Wondering whether Sean Holmes’ production is ill-suited to the space of the Lyric and whether Anna Fleischle’s design ends up feeling way too remote? Finding any mention of the German legal system dull? Honest…  Being fascinated by the moral conundrum that makes up the meat of the play but pretty much confident of how I would vote from the outset?
Does Terror make a courtroom drama theatrically exciting? Will you still end up being somewhat entertained regardless? "
177,177,Ought To Be Clowns,13/11/2009,Ian,Blood Brothers, Phoenix,"Written by Willy Russell, this musical pits nature versus nurture in the story of two two non-identical twin brothers, Mickey and Eddie, who are separated at birth due to the financial difficulties of their mother and end up following completely different lives. Adopted by the mother’s well-off employer Mrs Lyons, Eddie becomes an Oxbridge-educated success whilst Mickey languishes on the breadline, struggling to maintain employment and to stay out of jail, yet their unexpected friendship manages to survive. However, when they both fall in love with the same girl, it proves to be a strain too far. First things first, how does Sporty Spice fare? Having signed up for a six month contract as the matriarch Mrs Johnstone, she is clearly taking this seriously and it seems a natural fit, she’s the first native scouser to take up the role! And vocally she is superb: she always was the strongest singer of the Spice Girls and her singing performance here reflects that. She uses a pop voice, which brings a lovely clarity to her songs and a refreshing lack of showiness which works really well in her flirtatious opening numbers and importantly in the final showstopper. Her acting was fine, though clearly not her strength, but this is an accomplished debut. Despite the star billing though, for me the heart of this musical is Mickey and Eddie’s relationship, depicted beautifully here by Stephen Palfreman and Richard Reynard. Normally, the thought of adults pretending to be kids on stage gives me the chills, but here it is done with such genuine warmth and humour, it really is quite affecting. One really feels the spark of friendship between the two despite their disparate upbringings and it is done with restraint and never becomes silly. There is also good support from Vivienne Carlyle as Mrs Lyons, helpless to stop the truth from affecting her relationship with her adoptive son, and from Louise Clayton as Linda, caught between the two brothers. If I’m being picky, then the only real complaint I have is that every other character is aged effectively throughout the show, Chisholm’s Mrs Johnstone seems to simply put on a coat and so it didn’t feel like they had made sufficient effort to show the passing of time on her character. Whilst it is clearly easier to show the transitions from childhood to late teens, even Mrs Lyons goes through a transformation, which made it even more obvious."
178,178,Ought To Be Clowns,23/09/2009,Ian,Our Class, National,"I have to admit to initially having my doubts as the play opened with adults pretending to be schoolchildren which is never nice to see, but there was enough humour present to see the scene through as they all talked about what they wanted to be in the future. The cast of ten actually play their characters throughout their lifespan and so my doubts were quickly dispelled as the classmates grew up throughout the 1930s with the twin shadows of Soviet and Nazi invasions shattering their childhood dreams and ultimately setting them against each other to brutal effect. This is powerful, moving, unflinching stuff that will stay with me for a long time. It is so easy with hindsight to say what one would have done in the face of the evils of fascism and war, and what this play does brilliantly is to highlight the difficult decisions and unimaginable sacrifices that many had to make just to even survive to the next day, and then their struggles to reconcile those choices after the fact. Each of the ten characters is given their moment to shine, and so whilst this had an impact on the running time (3 hours with interval), it meant that one was fully engaged with the entire piece and everyone in it. As one by one they passed away, they took seats on the edge of the stage on the chairs that had previously been used in the schoolroom scenes, and they too watched the rest of the events unfold. I really liked the use of chants to punctuate the scenes, they added an urgency to the proceedings which maintained the heightened sense of tension. The Cottesloe has been reconfigured into the round (or more accurately the rectangle) and this setting worked perfectly: sat on the front row I almost felt part of the action and completely immersed into the intimate atmosphere with the barest of sets and minimal effects. I would very much like to see more productions here use this staging format as it really enhanced the experience and it was the first time I had seen it used this way. It seems unfair to single out any of the cast as they were all excellent, delivering strong, honest performances which always felt truthful, no matter how horrific: that said, Lee Ingleby was just terrific as the manipulative Zygmunt, and Amanda Hale and Tamzin Griffin both impressed, particularly with their struggles to deal with life as survivors after the war. But the quality of the ensemble really was excellent throughout, and given this was a preview, all the more impressive. Haunting, brutal and sometimes painful though this may be, this is important, powerful work and I could not recommend it more."
179,179,Ought To Be Clowns,07/01/2004,Ian,His Girl Friday, National Theatre,"As the central couple, Zoë Wanamaker and Alex Jennings were simply fabulous, the electricity between them just crackles with suppressed sexual energy as it is clear that this couple really does belong together and their fights full of whip-sharp wisecracks and putdowns are a joy to watch as the intersection of their professional and personal relationships makes for a whole lotta farcical fun and they are both excellent at showing how dog-eat-dog their world is. The supporting cast was full of brilliantly observed cameos, chief of which was Margaret Tyzack’s feisty mother-in-law-to-be who was scene-stealingly funny every time she appeared. Nathan Osgood’s ridiculous reporter, Harry Towb’s corrupt mayor and Nicola Stephenson’s moll were all good value for money too."
180,180,Ought To Be Clowns,28/03/2019,Ian,Emilia, Vaudeville Theatre,"Is there anything currently on the London stage that is more gracefully eloquent than the moment that the transformative power of grief is writ large at a crucial point a third of the way into Emilia. It’s a rare moment of beautiful subtlety in a play that is more often considerably bolder in its sentiment but it’s also a mark of just how nuanced Nicole Charles’ production and Morgan Lloyd Malcolm’s writing is, even while some tie themselves in knots trying to square its historical and feminist credentials.   A transfer from Shakespeare’s Globe last summer (officially the 13th best show of the year doncha know) where its short run caught fire, its all-female and wonderfully diverse cast and creative team mean that all three of the Strand’s major playhouses currently have work written by women in them (I wonder when this last happened). And while that ought not to be noteworthy, god knows it still is and it all ties up rather neatly with Lloyd Malcolm’s writing. For though this is a play about a historical woman, it is also a play about all women.My review from last year can be found here and much of it remains pertinent. The play has been trimmed down a touch, restaged for a proscenium arch and partly recast. So the lead role of Emilia is now shared by Saffron Coomber, Adelle Leonce and the returning Clare Perkins and it is an achingly moving theatrical device that is just so affecting. Coomber’s youthful ebullience darkens into Leonce’s circumspect melancholy which feeds into the explosive fury of Perkins’ rallying cries. And as all three are often onstage together, the synergy between them is gorgeous to watch as the other ‘selves’ relive their experiences (seriously, I’d pay to watch the first act again just to Leonce’s nuanced reactive acting – simply superb). And little of the show’s energy has been lost in the move across the river. Anna Morrissey’s choreography matches Lloyd Malcolm’s gleefully anachronistic cherry-picking of contemporary references, the live music (Luisa Gerstein) feels more urgent than ever, and Joanna Scotcher’s set design brings in Zoe Spurr’s lighting to palpable effect, asking questions of how and why and what is theatre. I particularly loved the way in which the play bleeds out into the auditorium, the company relishing the chance to drag up as the male characters and act like the dicks they are. "
181,181,Ought To Be Clowns,13/06/2014,mag9l,Mr Burns, Almeida,"When did theatre get this exciting again? Love it or hate it, and the critical response that has come in today seems to run the full gamut, Anne Washburn’s simply extraordinary play Mr Burns can lay a bold claim to be just unlike anything else on a London stage at the moment. I was pleased to have avoided finding out much about it in advance, even if one particular surprise was spoiled for me on Twitter, coming to something so fresh is a rarity these days but even had I read the play from cover to cover beforehand, I don’t think anything could have prepared me for the experience of watching Robert Icke’s breath-takingly audacious production. In all honesty, it is something that needs to be experienced to truly get it, I haven’t ‘felt’ a new play this much in ages, my reactions ranging from complete and absolute intrigue to slack-jawed amazement to hoots of laughter. Three distinct acts – all 40 minutes long – take us through the aftermath of some unspecified apocalyptic event in North America. Spread over nearly a century, Washburn muses on what the remnants of society’s reaction would be, what might survivors cling onto when hope is all but gone, what coping mechanisms would be developed to either distract from the horrors that have gone before or the uncertainty that lies ahead. As it turns out, it is popular culture that provides the binding glue in this case and specifically here, The Simpsons. But though an appreciation of the US cartoon, the longest running sitcom in the world lest you forget, will clue you into some of the finer nuances contained within, it is far from necessary. For though the first section sees a group of survivors huddled round a campfire, zeroing in on one particular episode and trying to recall, recount, and replay it, the real focus lies in what they’re avoiding talking about, what is revealed in the asides and the pauses and eventually in the arrival of a stranger, who brings with him the news, or the lack of it, that they’re all hanging on.  Likewise, the shift to the second section where we see the same group seven years later strikes home on two levels. With the power plant network having collapsed, society has splintered into small groups who all make do and our group have become a performance troupe, acting out old Simpsons episodes, commercials and power-pop medleys not only just to eke out a living but to try and recapture the memories and sensations of a past that is quickly fading away as their collective present becomes increasingly threatening. And the final act – wowzers! The characters we’ve come to love are replaced with near-operatic grandeur and a further shift in tone that is shattering.  I was hooked from the beginning and thoroughly engaged throughout, the sheer inventiveness, not just of Washburn’s writing but also Icke’s direction is just something wonderful to behold. Tom Scutt’s costumes and Orlando Gough and Michael Henry’s score really come into their own in the final act, Philip Gladwell’s lighting does amazing work in three completely different scenarios and Scutt’s conceptual design rightly keeps us on our toes and ready to gasp at the next revelation. And that cast – they’re all my favourites but Adrian der Gregorian, Annabel Scholey and Jenna Russell probably edge the three acts respectively but all eight do sterling work, keeping us on track in this strangest of journeys. "

183,183,Ought To Be Clowns,25/10/2015,mag9l,Peter Pan – A Musical Adventure in Concert, Adelphi,"Just a quickie for this semi-staged concert version of Stiles + Drewe’s Peter Pan as my afternoon was pretty much ruined by the young family next to me, two toddlers quite literally running amok, uncontrolled by a mother who didn’t care that her children were repeatedly climbing over me. I’m all for theatres being more inclusive and welcoming to young’uns but the other side of that is that you have to prepare your children for the practicalities of sitting down for a couple of hours along with everyone else. Which is a shame, as this is a rather sweet musical version of JM Barrie’s evergreen story of the boy who never grew up. Even with weird man-boy Ray Quinn in the lead role and the pantomimish Bradley Walsh as Captain Hook, there’s something really quite affecting about the child-like wonder of Stiles + Drewe’s interpretative skill, which still simultaneously offers up a more mature worldview – it’s easy to forget the deep sadness that lies at the heart of the story, Sheila Hancock’s Narrator providing some deeply moving moments."
184,184,Ought To Be Clowns,01/02/2013,Ian,Lift, Soho Theatre,"A musical looking at “love, life and loss in a London lift”, Craig Adams and Ian Watson’s Lift is a thing to treasure in and of itself – a new British musical. Adams started writing the song cycle in 2005 and following the nurturing development of Perfect Pitch and its housing in the welcoming arms of the Soho Theatre – both necessarily ardent supporters of new musical theatre writing – it now makes its world premiere. The show looks at a cross-section of contemporary London life, taking its sample from the inhabitants of a lift at Covert Garden tube station as their lives intersect in the 54 seconds it takes to surface and then scatter to the wind on departing it. The central conceit is that even though we may not make eye contact with the people next to us on tube journeys, our lives are more connected than we know and so we see the paths of these eight characters cross again in varied and unexpected ways. It’s a neat concept but one which falls a little short in the execution, coming across as too haphazard in its bringing together of such disparate elements – we long for more of a connection, both between the characters but also between the characters and the audience, the device of the lift just doesn’t feel strong enough.  Part of the problem lies in the limited room for manoeuvre. With a company of 8 and a running time of 75 minutes, there’s precious little time to establish the depth of character needed for us to engage sufficiently with the travails of their lives. Occasionally, the pieces all fit together to wonderful effect: Julie Atherton’s jilted lesbian French teacher truly excels with her wrenching solo number ‘Lost in Translations’ and connects well with Cynthia Erivo’s thoughtful dancer, who might suggest a brighter future; Nikki Davis-Jones’ dowdy secretary sounds gorgeous in ‘That Rainy Day’; and there’s plenty of comedy too, not least in the online chat between two of the characters, neither of whom look quite like their profile pics and director Steven Paling wittily using two other actors to play out their digital dalliances."
185,185,Ought To Be Clowns,26/10/2013,Ian,From Here To Eternity, Shaftesbury Theatre," From Here to Eternity marks the return of noted lyricist Tim Rice to the London stage with this new adaptation of this World War II story, probably best known in its film incarnation and its iconic shenanigans in the surf. This treatment harks back to the original novel to introduce darker elements to the story yet it has also been transformed into a traditional West End musical, which brings with it a certain style that doesn’t always sit too well together with the material. Set in the adulterous, misogynistic, homophobic, racist and bullying atmosphere of the G Company barracks in Hawaii in the summer of 1941, Bill Oakes’ book – based on James Jones’ novel of his own experiences – has a strangely disjointed quality as it struggles to weave together its three main strands. First Sergeant Milt Warden is hot for his captain’s lascivious wife; new arrival Private Robert E Lee Prewitt is less concerned about joining the corps’ boxing team and falls in love with call girl Lorene instead; and Private Angelo Maggio spends his time ducking and diving, making a quick buck by fraternising with the island’s gay population. Oakes fails to intertwine these stories successfully with the result that people just disappear for long periods, their reappearance often a surprise reminder, so fully is the focus taken away from them. And little work is done to deepen the characters meaning the ensemble have to fight valiantly to make us care – Darius Campbell and Rebecca Thornhill are too stiff as the illicit lovers, with nothing done to explain the heat of their passion; Robert Lonsdale’s Prewitt and Siubhan Harrison’s Lorene fare much better as the fateful pair, resigned to their respective difficulties; and Ryan Sampson’s Maggio is an enlighteningly charismatic presence. Musically, West End debutant Stuart Brayson manages a solid job, his relatively traditional style of composing a safe pair of hands and frequent reprises mean you can leave the theatre humming at least two of the tunes. But there’s little sense of thematic continuity – it feels like a pick and mix assortment at times, an ill-advised blues number being the stray bad one – and hardly any harmonic complexity. With such a large company, the opportunity feels ripe for soaring ensemble numbers and rich choral work but these rarely appear, this music is tunefully pleasant rather than soul-stirringly good.  Likewise, Tim Rice’s much-feted lyrical contributions (Minnesota gets rhymed with quota, Alabama with panorama in the most playful song that opens Act 2) don’t have the epic quality needed to really engage us with the fates of all concerned (and just who is Joe?). Because ultimately none of them are particularly deserving of our sympathies, even as the skies darken tragically for the momentous events of the finale, the exhortation to care for ‘The Boys of ‘41’ is undone by the all too fresh memories of what they were really like. "
186,186,Ought To Be Clowns,17/10/2014,Ian,Guilt & Shame – Going Straight, Soho Theatre Upstairs,"I couldn’t possibly start recommending that one should drink before every show but nestled in the late timeslot (10.15pm start) at the Soho Theatre, it would be rude not to imbibe at least a little before going in to see Guilt & Shame’s Going Straight (although I would imagine it is just as much fun whilst stone-cold-sober, as long as you’re up for it). Somewhere between a play and a comedy sketch – on entrance, we get a blue or pink hairnet depending on gender – it’s a raucous, supremely silly but also relentlessly funny experience that would be well worth searching out if there were more performances scheduled (tomorrow is the last night). Gabriel Bisset-Smith and Robert Cawsey play Gabe and Rob, a pair of friends who are struggling with their sexuality. Well, Rob’s sexuality, he’s a gay virgin and overly vocally heterosexual Gabe is determined to get him on the straight (and narrow) by indoctrinating him in a six step program he has developed called The Church of Clarksianity. The tasks Rob must fulfil are increasingly daft and incorporate a great deal of audience participation which is where the loosened inhibitions may well come in useful (though I don’t think tonight’s audience needed too much guidance in the glory hole-based dance routine!)"
187,187,Ought To Be Clowns,07/03/2019,Ian,Pufferfish, VAULT Festival,"The necessities of quick get-ins and -outs at the VAULT Festival means that not unreasonably, many a show’s design has relied upon easily packable archive boxes. Clearly, Charlotte Espiner didn’t get the memo as her design for Pufferfish makes for hugely impressive impact on entrance to the Cage with its suspended marble effect torsos and plinth. Nick Bruckman’s play (of which I was allowed to attend a preview) takes a riveting and spine-chilling fresh look at Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer responsible for the death and dismemberment of 17 young men in the 1980s. Pushing past lurid headlines, Pufferfish seeks to try and understand something of the man as well as the murderer, delving deep not only into his psychology but into that of his victims too. To achieve this, Bruckman’s three-hander occupies a liminal space, a kind of purgatory where Arian Nik’s Chris roleplays through Dahmer’s victims, Asha Reid as his sister Anne fulfils the roles of their loved ones, watching on helplessly as they succumb variously to Jackson Milner’s all-too-ordinary Jeff. This way, we see the progression in Dahmer’s behaviour, the different traps he set to lure his victims in, the increasingly extreme – and distressing – things he then did to them and their bodies."
188,188,Ought To Be Clowns,06/08/2011,Ian,Around the World in 80 Days, The Scoop at More London,"As part of the free theatre available at The Scoop at More London which is now in its 9th impressive year, Around the World in 80 Days is a streamlined version of Phil Willmott’s original production for the Battersea Arts Centre 10 years ago which truncates the action in 75 swift minutes, accompanied by a suite of catchy original songs by Annemarie Lewis Thomas. It is freely adapted from Jules Verne’s novel and so whilst the shape of Phileas Fogg’s journey, the result of a wager to traverse the globe in an unheard-of 80 days, remains the same, the action is enlivened with highly recognisable figures from Victorian England passing comment on his progress. It is fast and furious and lots of good-natured fun. Eugene Washington’s stern Fogg is tempered by the lovable antics of Joseph Wicks’ Passepartout, his able assistant, and when they rescue the Princess Aouda – a personable turn from Suzanne Ahmet – from an Indian funeral pyre, even Fogg’s stony heart begins to melt as his eyes are opened to the vast cultural influences to which he is exposed as they journey through Asia – helped memorably by a grumpy elephant through the Indian jungle, mounted with great style – and then through the USA – with a great song set in Salt Lake City which predates The Book of Mormon by at least a decade! – before trying to make it back in time to England to settle the bet."
189,189,Ought To Be Clowns,02/01/2014,Ian,American Psycho, Almeida,"Third time round for this show, so little to add to my original review and then the subsequent brief re-review. One of my new year’s resolutions is to embrace seeing the shows I love more than once – there’s so much theatre in London and beyond that it has often felt like a crime to view things again rather than going to see something new and though that hasn’t changed, the joy of rewatching things recently has been particularly great. In that spirit, when a random cheap ticket popped up on the Almeida’s website, the prospect of seeing American Psycho again was irresistible. "
190,190,Ought To Be Clowns,03/09/2010,Ian,State Fair, Trafalgar Studios 2,"Originally produced at the Finborough last summer in what was incredibly its UK stage premiere, Rodgers & Hammerstein’s State Fair makes a transfer to the small basement theatre of Trafalgar Studios. Partly recast and given a design refresh, it extended its run by a couple of weeks due to demand, meaning I finally got round to seeing it, having been on holiday for most of its run, both this year and last. In the grand scheme of things, State Fair is a fairly simple play, it revolves around the Frakes, a rural farming family who journey to the three day Iowa State Fair to compete with their livestock and their condiments, and have a little fun too. It started life as a film with five Rodgers & Hammerstein songs in it, ‘It Might As Well Be Spring’ won them their only Oscar, but as it was developed into a musical in the late 90s, the score was substantially beefed up by the incorporation of a number of songs most of which had been cut from other R&H shows such as Oklahoma! and Pipe Dream. On paper one might question how good this could be, prizewinning pigs and homemade mincemeat are hardly the stuff one imagines a musical could revolve around, but director Thom Southerland performs real alchemy here in bringing together so many elements in absolute perfect harmony, that it is just a sheer delight and constantly laugh-out-loud funny to boot. Much credit has to go to (the frankly gorgeous) musical director Magnus Gilljam, who accompanies the actors throughout solely on piano and does wonders. The balance is just right, he doodles incidental music to many a scene without overpowering dialogue (something very few shows get right), he provides sound effects and the arrangements for the songs are just brilliant. There’s something fittingly traditional about a solo piano accompanying such a show, but make no mistake, this is as high quality and professional as it gets. Another area where it excels is in its use of choreography. Despite the extremely limited space available, Sally Brooks has come up with a set of routines completely in tune with the show: a hoe-down tap dancing numbers which I loved, a burlesque-esque routine for ‘That’s the Way it Happens’ performed well by Jodie Jacobs and one of the highlights of the show, a full-cast huge ensemble number for ‘All I Owe Ioway’ which is just breath-takingly good. Everyone in the ensemble does so well here but as ever, certain moments shine through: Laura Main’s rendition of ‘It Might As Well Be Spring’ (the Oscar winner) is quietly stunning and her acting throughout was nicely measured without being twee; Philip Rham’s Abel was constantly strong; Anthony Wise’s drunk acting as the show judge was possibly one of the funniest things I’ve seen this year and the way in which he adlibbed as a girl and her father first left to go to the toilet and then returned was just an absolute joy and I also loved Jodie Jacob’s aforementioned showgirl who had a touching chemistry with Karl Clarkson’s slightly dopey but totally lovable Wayne."
191,191,Ought To Be Clowns,21/11/2018,Ian,ear for eye, Royal Court,"Not too much to add about ear for eye that I didn’t already say in my original review but it was a play that I kept thinking about, reading and re-reading, and decided that I needed to see again to really get that confrontational power that it possesses. A bit disappointed to see a few people making a dash for it, clearly too much of a challenge for them but you have to laud debbie tucker green for creating the kind of structurally ingenious and politically urgent work that provokes such some emotion."
192,192,Ought To Be Clowns,05/11/2019,Ian,The Green Fairy, Union Theatre,"The Green Fairy announces itself as “a queer pub musical” which sounds like a genre that should have existed for years already and certainly feels like one rich with potential. And in the hands of debut musical writers Jack Sain (book, music and lyrics) and Stephen Libby (lyrics) together with dramaturg Hannah Hauer-King, it proves intriguing, even if the final effect is considerably more Once than Old Compton Street. Which is a good thing because this musical fully embraces its intimate actor-musician ensemble and  in a still all-too-rare occurrence, focuses on the L (or perhaps the B) in LGBT+. It is open mic night at newly refurbished pub The Green Fairy and knowing her estranged daughter is going to be singing, Jo turns up to the place where she used to work and live and drink, and where the ghosts of her past – her girlfriend, her husband, her childhood best friend – still linger on.   And being ever so fond of a drink, who else should be Jo’s spirit guide (badumtish) than the green fairy who lives in the bottle of absinthe (you know, like Kylie in Moulin Rouge). There’s something a lot grittier here though, as the roots of Jo’s alcoholism and isolation are traced through a riotous time as a young adult in the 90s which somehow never quite stopped, even as friends, lovers, children, dropped away.  Fairly heavy-going then, and there’s a brave choice to really not sugar-coat Jo’s character at all. The ever-marvellous Julie Atherton plays her with a real astringency, never looking for sympathy in her portrayal of a woman whose alcohol addiction has left her teetering on the edge of the abyss. And that voice! It’s a real thrill to witness it up close and personal like this and the Act 1 closer is the stuff musical theatre dreams are made of.  Around her are some sickeningly talented young people. Emma Whittaker as excellent as the younger incarnation of Jo, is amazing on both cello and violin and as if that wasn’t enough, produces a saxophone at one point to make us all ashamed of ourselves! Georgina Hellier is also highly impressive as she constantly flicks between the playful titular sprite and Jo’s slinky ex, she definitely establishes herself as a boldly charismatic actor and singer."
193,193,Ought To Be Clowns,25/10/2019,Ian,Botticelli in the Fire, Hampstead Theatre,"I’ve long been a fan of Blanche McIntyre and so appreciate any opportunity to see her direct away from the RSC. Jordan Tanahill’s knowingly chaotic Botticelli in the Fire is full of all kinds of riotous energy and queer representation but for me, it just wasn’t the one."
194,194,Ought To Be Clowns,23/03/2010,Ian,Finishing The Hat, Sondheim’s 80th Birthday Concert,"Finishing the Hat, at the King’s Head, featured a diverse array of West End performers coming together to pay tribute to Sondheim with a birthday concert, cherrypicking their favourite songs from his shows and performing them simply on a stage under Chris Peake’s musical direction, accompanied by keyboard, bass and percussion. The show was held together by compere Chris Allen, who provided some linking material whilst one performer shuffled off and the next emerged from the curtain behind, and a powerpoint presentation showed us pictures of the man himself throughout his career and even a hilarious snippet of the Simpsons. Yes, it was all a bit low-rent but this show proudly wore its heart on its sleeve and focused on highlighting the excellence of the compositions being sung, which even divested of their context remain songs of the highest quality. Highlights for me were Tim Driesen’s ‘Franklin Shepard, Inc.’ coping admirably with the sound effect heavy lyrics and Rebecca Caine’s beautifully subtle ‘Losing My Mind’. Driesen is someone who I think could have an exciting career ahead of him if he could land the right role here in London, he can next be found in his native Belgium in Notre Dame. Gabriel Vick had great fun belting out some huge notes in ‘Marry Me A Little’ and Jason Pennycooke’s medley of songs from West Side Story (I think he squeezed almost all of them in apart from ‘I Feel Pretty’) accompanied solely by percussionist Pete Dawson on the bongos was truly a sight to behold! The variety of performing styles and the quick rotation of performers meant that even if one didn’t enjoy say, the overtly cabaret stylings of one singer, or the interpretation of a certain number, we soon moved onto the next and the evening fair flew by. Being such a huge collaborative effort, the list of performers was always subject to change and so a few names disappeared from the list, Hollyoaks‘ Gerard McCarthy probably being the most notable, and there had been talk of a music or musical theatre student being given the chance to sing a song during the show, but no mention was made of that. And I would have liked perhaps one more group number at the end, although I realise the logistics of this would probably have been too difficult to surmount. Still, it was an evening of great fun: relaxed and informal, full of good, varied performances and a few names to watch out for in the future. The efforts of all who participated and organised this show, in the name of charity, were richly rewarded by the rapturous reception, and a genuine sense of having witnessed something special, Patti LuPone or no. All in all, a fitting tribute to the impressive career of Mr Sondheim."
195,195,Ought To Be Clowns,15/06/2012,Ian,Spinach, King’s Head,"Written by Janine Waters and composed by Simon Waters, Spinach defines itself as a sung play. Just 80 minutes long, its every word is sung to music though predominantly in recitative style, reflecting the ebb and flow of everyday speech, rather than through a set of songs as in a traditional musical. This Waters Edge production premiered in Manchester’s Royal Exchange Studio last year and has brought with it one of its original cast members as it starts up a run at the King’s Head Theatre Pub in Islington. The show begins with Tom and Kate waking up tied together in the cellar of a house, unable to recollect how they got there and seemingly unaware of who the other person is as they slowly realise that they have been drugged. As they ask questions of each other and as flashes of memory come back to them, the pair start to piece together clues about what has happened to them and why, uncovering a tale which twists and turns in the quirkiest of manners. The quality of the writing is at times exceptionally funny, blessed with a blunt Northern humour, and there are moments when one almost forgets that the cast are singing, especially in the witty repartee between Kate and Tom who find themselves drawn to each other, despite the situation, yet soon find out that there’s a reason why the chemistry between them is so good. Cassandra Compton’s investigative journalist is gorgeously sweet and wickedly funny and is very well-matched with Ben Gerrard’s pharmaceutical worker Tom who is also strong, though much more of an effort could be made to nerdify him so that he is closer to the socially inept, rubbish-with-the-girls character than the former Hollyoaks star that his handsome looks betray. We also benefit from the intermittent appearance of Tom’s workmates, the cleanliness-obsessed Maureen – Claire Greenway in scene-stealing form – and the inscrutable Darren, played with a nice depth by Craig Whittaker. These two additionally support the solo piano accompaniment, to often hilarious effect in the case of Greenway’s sax playing, which adds another layer of interest to the music. Every so often, the score does break into something which is identifiably a song but to mixed effect as it often enforces an abrupt shift in tone. This is also something which emerges in the culmination of Waters’ plotting, which is resolved incredibly speedily and a little too neatly, given the promise of the earlier scenes and it might have been interesting to explore the denouement a little more. As it is, we move swiftly to an epilogue which is almost a little too cloying but whose four-way counterpoint is probably the musical highlight of the show."
196,196,Ought To Be Clowns,29/03/2017,mag9l,Adam & Eve….and Steve, King’s Head,"If you were so inclined, you could rip into Adam & Eve….and Steve for its tendency towards dramatic inconsistency and slight musical blandness but as Beelzebub pops up to tell us early on, it’s all “just a bit of heavenly humour”. And given that the show has thrived on the festival circuit (including Edinburgh last year) and is now playing in the late slot at the King’s Head, the temptation to take the Devil’s advice is a strong one. For Adam & Eve… is affable indeed, enjoyable (particularly with a pint in hand) without ever straining too hard, and unashamedly light entertainment with its revisionist take on the Creation myth. Chandler Warren’s book posits a Garden of Eden where Eve’s temptation by an apple is matched with Adam’s temptation by an additional companion in Paradise called Steve, God’s plans for the human race thus thrown into disarray by the gays. Joseph Robinson’s Welsh-accented Adam is a wonderfully innocent central presence, playing off the duelling intentions of Hayley Hampson’s scouse Eve and Dale Adams’ kicky Steve and if there’s little tension in whether he’ll choose reproduction over furniture shopping, there’s something delicately well done about the conflict between friends and lovers. The script also shoehorns in any number of incongruous celebrity references from Bruce Forsyth to Beyoncé without ever really making them funny enough. What works better is the rivalry between Stephen McGlynn’s attention-craving Beelzebub and Michael Christopher’s booming-voiced God, their squabbles marvellously petulant and ultimately charmingly resolved in a soft-shoe vaudeville routine. Wayne Moore’s score scoots around a number of influences, almost music-hall style in its variety (at a cost perhaps to hummability), and Dean Austin’s musical direction from the piano works intelligently with the cast’s vocal abilities."
197,197,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2013,Ian,Desolate Heaven, Theatre503,"If you see two more accomplished or affecting debut performances this year than those of Carla Langley and Evelyn Lockley at the Theatre503, then you will be very lucky indeed. Along with the more seasoned Bríd Brennan, they star in Desolate Heaven, a new play from Irish composer and playwright Ailís Ní Ríain and a piece of new writing that dances variously between grimly realistic road-trip, lesbian coming-of-age story and cautionary fairytale. Langley’s Orlaith and Lockley’s Sive are both teenage girls and bound together by their similar responsibilities in acting as a carer for one parent in the absence of the other. Orlaith has developed a brittle exterior of forthright bluster in the face of her father’s mental illness but in dealing with her paralysed mother, Sive has become altogether more introverted. But despite the innate difference in their characters, they bond over the idea of fleeing the oppressive reality of their lives and seize the first chance that comes their way, unprepared for the consequences they’re ultimately forced to face.  Ní Ríain’s writing has a densely poetic quality which suits the mood of the piece – James Perkins’ pitch-perfect set helping too – as it wends its surrealist way through the trials and tribulations of the girls’ adventure, portraying the emotional closeness that grows between the pair as they test out the boundaries of their sexuality but also the suffocating intensity that comes from swapping one inordinately close relationship for another. Both actresses are utterly compelling, a raw freshness making their chemistry believable and the naïveté of their characters almost forgivable."
198,198,Ought To Be Clowns,02/07/2012,Ian,Sinbad,,"I’ve never been to the cinema to watch a TV programme before but there’s always a first time for everything and last Sunday we found ourselves in the midst of hordes of children during a family film funday to preview the new Sky 1 series Sinbad. The most expensive show Sky have ever commissioned in the UK, it was filmed over 9 months in Malta and marks a determined attempt to capture the family-friendly Dr Who/Merlin market from Impossible Pictures, who also produced Primeval. As you may have deduced from the pictures, my motives were not entirely artistic, as the show also marks the return of one of my favourite actors, Elliot Cowan, to the screen (plus introduces another nice-looking gentleman called Elliot into the bargain). And as I don’t have Sky and will have to wait for the DVDs to come out at the end of the 12 episode run, this seemed like too good an opportunity to miss to catch the first episode and attend the subsequent Q&A session. First things first, the show looks pretty darn fantastic on the evidence of the first episode at least. The show has reinvented Sinbad as a young man, rattling against the walls in his home city of Basra when an unfortunate turn of events makes a deadly enemy out of the ruling Emir’s brother. When tragedy then strikes, he is forced to flee the city and finds escape on the ship Providence where many an adventure lies in wait as he absorbs the repercussions of his actions with a motley crew of survivors, including Cowan’s rugged Viking Gunnar, Junix Inocian as a comedy chef, Estella Daniels as a mysterious princess and Marama Corlett as a chirpy urchin type.  Production values are sparkling, there’s a cinematic sweep to it in Colin Teague’s direction (and not just because I was watching on a big screen) and the Basra scenes looked suitably epic, especially during a parkour-inspired chase. But the show also looks good on the water and the special effects team have obviously worked hard on creating something that looks natural as well as impressive, but have equally let their imaginations run riot with a fearsome string of monsters to look forward to throughout the series. And the writing, by Jack Lothian for this episode, balanced comedy and mysticism quite well considering the amount of set-up it had to achieve as well. Elliot Knight, fresh out of drama school in his debut role, seems set to become a winningly charming lead as the well-meaning Sinbad, Dimitri Leonidas as the inexperienced ship’s doctor promises much, and I look forward to how the devious Lord Akbari and Taryn, Naveen Andrews and Orla Brady, decide to wreak their revenge on Sinbad as I do love a good baddie. The quality of the guest roles is indicated from the off by Janet Suzman’s brief but effective appearance here, Sophie Okenedo looked fierce in the trailer for next week and we’ve got Nikki Amuka-Bird, Miranda Raison and Dougray Scott to look forward to, along with Evanna Lynch who attended the Q&A sessions despite not being able to say much about her character (who I think is in the last episode). On the other hand, George Harris has been employed again…"
199,199,Ought To Be Clowns,07/08/2006,Ian,The Seagull, National Theatre,"And I didn’t like it. At all. So many of the directorial choices were just annoying: the tendency towards the naturalistic speaking style meant that far too many crucial lines were swallowed up, most criminally in Nina’s monologue; even when they were loud enough, the idea to have the domestic servants continually running across the stage throughout the scenes resulted in more distraction away from the clear delivery of lines; the dim lighting restricts how much of the actors’ faces you can see (on the one hand this forces you to watch their physical performance more, but on the other, for a lip-reader like me, it was a nightmare). The story is essentially about how painful it is to love someone who loves someone else. So playwright Konstantin loves actress Nina who ends up with novelist Trigorin, who just happens to be the partner of Arkadina who is Konstantin’s mother. And there’s a raft of supporting characters who follow the same pattern in being both attached to and attracted to the wrong people. In Juliet Stevenson and Ben Whishaw, there’s two absolutely top-class actors on stage, supported by a number of strong supporting players, but it did not feel like Mitchell is interested in showcasing their talent but rather using them to prop up her ideas. Without fail, everyone is portrayed as irrational and self-righteous, so characters that are already self-pitying become even more unlikeable and unsympathetic. So despite their best efforts, Stevenson’s overly neurotic Arkadina and Whishaw’s subdued Konstantin just don’t engage at all. Hattie Morahan was good and nicely fragile but was guilty of the worst of the mumbling in the opening scene as Nina which was just frustrating to me."
200,200,Ought To Be Clowns,11/09/2013,Ian,Fleabag, Soho Theatre,"It is easy to see why Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, written and performed by herself, was such a hit in Edinburgh, winning a Fringe First award for its fearlessly filthy and frank take on female sexual liberation in the 21st century. As it rattles from sharp one-liners to predominantly smutty anecdotes, we see a young woman fully embracing her potent sexuality and apparently loving it, loving it, loving it.  She seizes the world of opportunity that is open to her on a regular basis – maintaining an on-off relationship with her boyfriend whilst indulging in casual hook-ups of all shapes and sizes and variations as and when the mood takes her. And inbetween, she masturbates relentlessly to internet porn, satiating her addiction any way she can. But though she’s happy fulfilling these desires, life around her is beginning to crumble.  Waller-Bridge is an entirely charismatic performer and as she skips lightly between the various characters in Fleabag’s life – the drunk girl on the tube, the Cockney geezer who’s a regular in her cafe, any number of her gormless suitors – she is most entertaining to watch. But the deeper side – the hints of sadness at the loss of her family life, the lingering doubts about the recent death of her best friend – doesn’t resonate with enough emotion to make us care about her as much as we could. "
201,201,Ought To Be Clowns,08/02/2013,Ian,Fiesta – The Sun Also Rises, Trafalgar Studios 2,"The art of adapting a novel for the stage is often fraught with difficulties, the need to balance fidelity to the source material with the demands of a different art form is further complicated by the expectations and preconceptions that audience members familiar with the book bring to the theatre. And so adaptations run the gamut from slavish retellings to freewheeling interpretations and more often than not, someone will come out saying ‘well it wasn’t like the book…’. So it may seem a brave choice for Alex Helfrecht to take on Ernest Hemingway’s first and most celebrated novel Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises, but it is one that is attacked with invention and gusto to create an admirably different theatrical experience.  From the moment that one enters the intimacy of Trafalgar Studios 2 to see and hear the bass, sax and drums of the Trio Farouche jazz band establishing an entirely appropriate mood, it is clear that Helfrecht, who also directs, is as concerned with symbolism and atmosphere as story. The band remain part of the staging throughout, soundtracking the action from bohemian Parisian bars to the bullring at Pamplona and Sonja Perreten’s choreography is frequently used to convey the emotional interplay and depth of passion between characters. And Rachel Noël’s design of suspended wine glasses leaves the cast literally soaked with red wine as a visual cue to the recklessness of their carousing but also the aftermath of the climactic bullfight. The story has necessarily been condensed for the stage, distilled to the travails of American expats Jake and Robert when the vivacious Lady Brett Ashley swishes into their lives in 1920s Paris. A WWI veteran, Jake is a budding sports reporter and his Jewish friend Robert is a novelist who is preparing for a wedding and neither are prepared for the love triangle that emerges with Brett’s arrival, her self-assurance and sexual confidence an irresistible combination which catches fire as they travel to Spain for Jake to cover the world of bullfighting, the introduction of handsome young matador Pedro further complicating matters, sex and violence igniting to visceral effect."
202,202,Ought To Be Clowns,23/02/2020,Ian,The Extraordinary Time-Travelling Adventures of Baron Munchausen, VAULT Festival,"Many things happened at The Extraordinary Time-Travelling Adventures of Baron Munchausen, but I’m sure you’ll agree that me making my VAULT Festival stage debut is one of the most noteworthy 😉 It just goes to show that even though that this is a family-friendly improv show with its eye on the kids in the audience, the adults alongside them have no chance of escaping being a significant part of the fun as well. Like so many improvised shows, there’s a simple set-up. Three storytellers taking it in turns to come up with an adventure story based on an idea drawn from a hat and followed up by a series of audience suggestions which, given the imaginative freedom of the young, are as outlandish and random as they are really quite amusing, once woven into the tales by these talented comedians (Lord Lovell, Admiral Seward and Lady Brooke I think it was at this show)."
203,203,Ought To Be Clowns,22/09/2016,mag9l,The Hired Man in concert, Cadogan Hall,"Marking the first major concert presentation of the show in over 20 years, The Hired Man in concert saw Howard Goodall and Melvyn Bragg’s 1984 musical take over the elegant surroundings of Cadogan Hall, for a glorious evening celebrating one of the all-time greats of British musical theatre writing. With a boutique orchestra conducted by Andrew Linnie, an ensemble of over 20 singers and a lead cast of bona fide West End and Broadway stars, it was a powerfully effective treatment of the material. The Hired Man is based on Bragg’s 1969 novel, part of his Cumbrian Trilogy, following the lives of labourer and miner John Tallentire and his wife Emily as they battle first the hardship of agricultural life in a fast-industrialising world and then the impact of the First World War on their whole community. And supporting it, Goodall’s music and lyrics draws on English folk tradition, as well as his own melodious style, to create a soulful, stirring score that lingers long in the mind with its hummability and heartbreak. For this concert, director Samuel Hopkins was able to secure John Owen-Jones (fresh from reprising the role of Valjean on Broadway) and Jenna Russell (recently in Doctor Faustus) and he couldn’t have picked a better pair for John and Emily. Being able to hear Owen-Jones use all the colours of the subtler side of his voice demonstrated just how formidable a leading man he really is. And there are simply few actors in the country as good at acting through song as Russell, even singing from a book behind a lectern she was just unbearably heartfelt."

205,205,Ought To Be Clowns,25/01/2017,mag9l,Dirty Great Love Story, Arts,"Richard and Katie’s meet-cute is in a sketchy Bristol nightclub. He’s on a stag night and been single for a while, she’s on a hen do and nursing a broken heart and with friends egging them on, they’re soon sharing shots at the bar, sweat on the dancefloor and shags in a hastily procured hotel room. In the fug of the next morning’s hangover, she beats a hasty retreat but not before she wonders if there isn’t perhaps the spark of something there, and thus the rest of the play covers the next two years in the lives of these 30-something Londoners as they will-they-won’t-they their way to a climax of which even Bridget Jones would be proud.  The conceit of the writing is that it is deeply poetic, written in rhyming verse and laden with expressive imagery. But the relationship is depicts is a wonderfully British one of stop-start missed chances, from awkward Whigfield dance routines to meaningful conversations in a greasy spoon, drunken post-festival blowjobs to carefully filed remembrances of food allergies, the play is rich in lived-in detail and not just the shagging and puking. And in Pia Furtado’s alert production across Camilla Clarke’s playfully designed open set, it is impossible not to root for this pair. Felix Scott’s geeky(ish) Richard is sweetness and just a little naive, Ayesha Antoine’s assertive Katie is more worldly-wise but also more emotionally bruised, and they bounce off each other perfectly, whether dealing with each other, addressing the audience directly or playing any number of the supporting characters in their lives (the bluntly northern Westy and Made-in-Chelsea-a-like CeCe are particular highlights in their own love story). Sure, there’s a knowingness to much of the writing but there’s also a great big twinkle in its eye that makes it impossible to resist. "
206,206,Ought To Be Clowns,18/12/2011,Ian,Little Women The Musical, LOST Theatre,"With music and lyrics by Lionel Segal and book by Peter Layton, this version of Little Women The Musical bears no relation to the production that ran for a short while on Broadway and has only been seen before in a one night concert showcase in 2005, making this the UK premiere run at the LOST theatre in Wandsworth. The musical is based on Louisa May Alcott’s well-loved 1868 novel, following the fortunes of the four March sisters in New England during Civil War-time as family responsibilities are cast against personal ambition and lives and loves pass by as poverty and social change loom large. Whereas Layton book remains largely faithful to the novel, it’s not a story that one would assume immediately lends itself to the musical treatment. Segal’s music does not overtly embrace the music of the time as far as I could perceive, but rather goes for a modern-sounding aesthetic which is extremely successful in parts and less so in others. Where the show is at its strongest is in elucidating the sisterly dynamic between the March girls and their songs together illuminate this perfectly, a real sense of familial bond emerging from their playful vitality and gorgeous harmonising. Charlotte Newton John’s characterful Jo leads the show extremely well, with sensitive support from Claire Chambers and Laura Hope London as Beth and Meg respectively and a sprightly turn from Caroline Rodgers as the young brattish Amy, who delivers her malapropisms perhaps a little too knowingly. But the play isn’t about the sisters alone and this is where the show falls down as it just doesn’t have a distinct enough voice, musically or dramatically. The various suitors to the sisters are all saddled with rather anodyne musical declarations of love reflecting their rather bland characters, only Glenn Lloyd’s Seamus managed to inject sufficient personality to stand out. Myra Sands’ cantankerous Aunt March and Jane Quinn’s meddling neighbour both provide good comic support but are never allowed to become more than caricatures. And even Nicola Delaney’s Marmee feels marginalised, her getting the final spotlight seems at odds with the show we’ve just seen. And because the story is so familiar to so many of us, the direction alongside it also feels a little too reverential, predictable even in how much of the show plays out. When surprises come, they feel misjudged, as in the dream sequence which allows a show-stopping Broadway number to be shoehorned in (it is a catchy song though and has a great routine attached to it, complete with yellow stocking gag) or the main final number, ‘Everybody’s Gettin’ Married’ which with its chirpiness, rams home the happy ending a little too forcefully. I also disliked the way in which several performers used singing voices which were hugely at odds with their character’s speaking voices, it was a real disconnect that undermined much of their dramatic work."
207,207,Ought To Be Clowns,12/06/2010,Ian,Bloody Wimmin, Women,"“There’s only so much non-violence one can take” The only play to feature the entire ensemble is Lucy Kirkwood’s Bloody Wimmin which rounds off the evening for Then. Taking the shocking fact, that many women in their 20s have never heard of Greenham Common or what it stood for as its starting point,  it looks back at the protest camp set up in the name of nuclear disarmament, how it developed and what it came to mean to the women who were there, and then it moves to look at what, if any, impact it has on today’s society. Starting off on Greenham Common itself with a delightful sending-up of the stereotypical view of the protesters, chunky-knit and wellington-boot wearing lesbians smelling of wood-smoke and obsessed with petty squabbles usually about the minutiae of cleaning and cooking rotas and missing ladles. Things take a more serious tone with the arrival of pregnant Helen, played by Claire Cox, and we follow her on her journey as a woman seeking personal liberation and enlightenment away from the daily grind and society’s expectations of her, especially as a mother and an expecting one as well to boot. Her confrontation with husband Bob (Oliver Chris) is genuinely shocking as they play a game of brinkmanship with the emotional missiles they have on each other, papering the cracks of their marriage and so we see Greenham actually as the catalyst for empowering women. Shifting the action to a modern-day climate change protest camp cleverly plays up how things have changed and in some cases, stayed exactly the same. John Hollingworth plays James, Helen’s now-teenage son with a beautiful gaucheness, unsure of how to deal with women when his sexual attraction conflicts with his highly feminist upbringing and Lara Rossi brings a spikiness to her activist Sophie who is completely unaware of what the women of her parents’ generation went through in order to try and relocate political discussion in a more inclusive sphere, eventually softening when she discovers her own grandmother was present on Greenham Common. Kika Markham’s tender recollections of someone who only had a small encounter on the Common yet the ramifications of which changed her whole life and her marriage is captured magnificently in a 5 minute soliloquy which summed everything about the whole season perfectly: “it’s very easy to laugh at passion”."

Pinter is one of those writers for me, I can’t say I’ve ever enjoyed myself at one of his plays and at this point, I can’t see myself having a breakthrough moment with him in the way that I did with, say, Chekhov."

211,211,Ought To Be Clowns,17/06/2016,mag9l,Macbeth, New Wimbledon Studio,"Theatre company Arrows & Traps came belatedly onto my radar with their rather stunning rendition of Anna Karenina earlier this year so I was keen to check out what they’d do next, which turned out to be Macbeth in the similar black box space of the New Wimbledon’s Studio. Adapted and directed by Ross McGregor, this modern Macbeth continually builds on its interesting choices to deliver a final 10 minute sequence that is as achingly affecting as any version of the play I’ve ever seen. And they are strong choices for the most part too. Arrows & Traps’ commitment to gender equality sees them offer up a company that has 6 women to 5 men, casually flipping Duncan (Jean Apps) and Banquo (an excellently badass Becky Black) into female roles and having the witches double up as murderers and soldiers. In some ways its a small thing but in others, it still feels radical; as pointed out, majority-female fight scenes as those seen here are few and far between.  The modern setting is wisely underplayed, David Paisley’s titular warrior demonstrates the symptoms of what we might call PTSD now but the core of the play, and this production, is the sheer intensity of the relationship between the Macbeths. Their first reunion is played with an agonising potency, sexual hunger bleeding into something animalistic, especially once they confirm the plans to realise the ambitions that they both share – there’s no mistaking the gleam in Lady M’s eye here as she’s given the crown for safekeeping upon Duncan’s visit. Equally, there’s no doubting the role of the supernatural here. The witches combine a mishmash of influences – steampunk goggles, singer/songwriter musical interludes (I think I heard a bit of Kyla La Grange in there), omnipresent looming – to become something genuinely disturbing, their second-act incantations brought chills to the spine. And it is into this all-too-real occult that Cornelia Baumann’s Lady Macbeth taps quite astoundingly with her ‘unsex me here’ speech, a reading of devastating power. McGregor’s adaptation finds more of these moments – the Macduffs’ murder is another powerful strike – but it doesn’t quite always maintain the same level of fresh invention. It is only in the final moments that all its elements coalesce into something wonderful, in the way that made Anna Karenina sing, as the swells of Samuel Morgan-Grahame and Gemma Salter’s music give rise to a gorgeous dance of the dead, capped off with an enormous emotional sucker-punch. And then the closing image that manages to incorporate both present and future, the power of the real world and yet the lingering impact of the supernatural…it’s a stunning finale that makes you wish just a little bit more of this magic had been sprinkled earlier on in the play (I will thank the person that finally makes Malcolm and Macduff’s scene one to watch rather than endure). Still, much here to enjoy here with these intensely committed performances and a rare vision from Arrows & Traps that marks them as one on whom to definitely keep an eye."
212,212,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2018,Ian,Elsa, VAULT Festival,"Isobel Rogers’ Elsa is a one-woman song and story affair, a paean to the joys of eavesdropping but also beautifully reflective on the state of the world, and Elsa’s own place in it. Snippets of personal dramas breeze in and out of the coffee shop doors and Rogers captures them perfectly with a scathingly funny sense of humour. At just 50 minutes, Sara Joyce’s production doesn’t outstay its welcome and the decision to drop the guitar late on for a smattering of rap offers a useful variation of tone. For all that it celebrates being a nosy bitch, Elsa does have a lovely poignancy to it too that elevates it beyond the stereotypical millennial moan."
213,213,Ought To Be Clowns,01/02/2018,Ian,Double Infemnity, VAULT Festival,"A one-woman feminist re-interpretation of the crime noir genre, the idea of Double Infemnity felt right up my boulevard from the moment I read about it. And marking the first collaboration between two female theatre companies, Little but Fierce and Paperclip Theatre – see, the VAULT Festival really does bring people together! – it was an enterprise I was happy to support. I have to say though, that the reality didn’t quite match up to my expectation. Part of the problem lay in having seen a sharp and hilarious gay interpretation of the genre last week at this very festival in Tumulus. By comparison, Double Infemnity seemed to struggle in determining whether it was subverting, homaging or pastiching – the claim to be doing all three simultaneously feels a bit of a stretch. It’s interesting to note there’s three writers credited here – Catherine O’Shea, Jennifer Richards and Naomi Westerman – and though the writing initially crackles with the potential of the new slant it explores, its feminist credentials end up a little blunted by the reliance on repetition  which threatens to turn the refreshingly novel into tiresome cliché well within the space of an hour.  There are many points to be made about the paucity of complex female roles and drama’s tendency to stick to what it knows in nearly always making these kind of detectives men. And there’s laughs to be had in puncturing their pomposity, particularly in the love interests they’re able to score. And there’s also respect to be paid, as Philip Marlowe is one hell of a character, spearheading one hell of a mode of storytelling."
214,214,Ought To Be Clowns,29/01/2017,mag9l,The Convert, Gate,"Danai Gurira’s Eclipsed was the best thing I saw in 2015 so the prospect of seeing her 2012 play The Convert, also at the Gate Theatre, was a joyous one indeed. And once again, Gurira turns her focus to the African continent, exploring the kind of history that I’m pretty sure is rarely featured in the majority of Western schoolrooms. The year is 1896 and the place is Rhodesia, the country now known as Zimbabwe, and The Convert takes a look at colonialism there from the inside out. Chilford may be a native of this territory but taken from his family as a young boy, he has been moulded into an approximation of ‘an English gentleman’, the only black Roman Catholic priest in the area and tasked with the job of converting the population to the ways of their colonial masters. On the run from an attempt at forced marriage, Jekesai finds sanctuary under Chilford’s tutelage, renamed as Ester and quickly becoming his star pupil but as she comes to understand just how much she’s expected to give up, she’s left to question if there’s any safe haven at all. Set exclusively in the drawing room of Chilford’s home, whose soft furnishings and flooring set it far apart from the norm and draw the ire of angry villagers, Gurira opts not to directly feature any white colonialists but to adroitly show the smothering blanket of their influence. So we see Stefan Adegbola’s Chilford done up in Victorian tailoring and speaking the Queen’s English, badly as it turns out, and his Doolittle-ish approach to Mimi Ndiweni’s Jekesai covers up more than her bare-breastedness, as his insistence of her adherence to her new faith includes denying all reference to her old, including her extended family. As a portrait of cultural warfare, The Convert is devastatingly good. Christopher Haydon’s production smartly shows us the different ways resistance can take form – Clare Perkin’s Mai Tamba, Chilford’s housekeeper and Jekesai’s aunt, flirts dangerously with both worlds, doing the bare minimum to convince of her conversion to keep her job but practising ancient rituals as soon as he turns his back. And in the performance of the night, Joan Iyiola’s fiercely intelligent Prudence aims for a more balanced position between the two, even as she recognises how increasingly impossible co-existence is."
215,215,Ought To Be Clowns,07/02/2015,Ian,It’s Only A Play, Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre,"Of everything that I saw or considered seeing in New York, It’s Only A Play possibly best exemplifies the dilemma I faced. Being such an actor junkie, the prospect of Stockard Channing and Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally (the latter two for the first time) was hugely tempting but I could scarcely ignore the fact that they were in a backstage farce. But the lure of the Lane was strong and so I booked myself in, hoping that low expectations would allow me to enjoy it.  That the show slags off the idea of star casting whilst engaging in that very practice could well be the starting point for something amusingly meta but that is far from the mark here. ‘im from Harry Potter is solely here to put bums on seats. And it has worked. How funny. Additionally, the theatre world of 1986, when it was originally written, was a different place and no amount of topical gags can disguise that – McNally really does try to have his cake and eat it here with paeans to misunderstood playwrights and insults for deluded theatre critics."
216,216,Ought To Be Clowns,17/03/2013,Ian,Richard Beadle – Songs , St James Studio,"Nestled in the basement of the newly-built St James Theatre in Victoria is a studio with an ambitiously varied programme of events that runs throughout the week but at weekends, it turns into a cabaret space hosting a range of singers from the world of musical theatre and beyond. And this Sunday saw the turn of songwriter and West End musical director Richard Beadle to showcase his work in a concert mainly featuring songs from his album, simply entitled Songs, sung by a host of West End stars.  The show was split into two halves – the first taking in songs from his musical work-in-progress Today Is My Day and the second, an assortment of other numbers from his songbook and from the albums of other people with whom he has worked – but unifying the whole evening was Beadle’s clear gift for songwriting. His ear for a clean and uncomplicated melody is perfect for the effective telling of story through song and so the simple but powerful emotions behind songs like the traumatic ‘1967’ delivered beautifully by Niamh Perry and the melancholy ‘Here We Are’, Rachael Wooding revelling in the chance to show a subtler side to her voice, shone through with an impressive lyrical naturalism. His more comic numbers, from Today Is My Day at least, don’t have quite the lyrical heft and so rarely reached the same levels of distinguished impact. But away from his musical, there was greater success with Chris Thatcher and Jon Boydon both giving great life to some more light-hearted numbers, Stuart Matthew Price demonstrating a strong sense of character and some vocal fireworks on a handful of songs including one backed by the Arts Ed choir and Sabrina Aloueche coming pretty close to stealing the show with the delicately beautiful yet rousing Forever Young, backed with a deliciously retro sax solo.  The only real small criticism was that as a host, Beadle gave us perhaps a little too much chat in-between songs. This was useful in giving us the context for the first half material, locating the songs at their various places in the show from which they had been taken. But it also complicated matters a little unnecessarily – whereas the three highly diverse songs sung by the mother would all have been enjoyable in their own regard, knowing they belonged to the same character needlessly exposed the work still needed to be done."
217,217,Ought To Be Clowns,08/02/2012,Ian,The Changeling, Young Vic,"And the question is do designers ever actually sit in the seats that surround the sets that they create. I ask because Ultz’s design for The Changeling, currently playing in the Young Vic’s Maria studio, stretches the seating round all four sides as well as into a set of nooks and crannies and wheelchairs downstairs. This is fine on two sides with the usual red seating but with the others, a single row of seats has been placed behind a heavy thick rampart meaning that visibility of a third of the stage is compromised and only partly rectified by leaning forward. Combined with the dreaded unreserved seating and the sheer arrogance of the audience members who refused to budge up like everyone else did in order to maintain ‘their’ spot and forcing some extraordinary contortions in order to allow many people to pass them, I couldn’t help but feel this was a configuration that had its audience too far back in its mind than is truly acceptable. This won’t be the case for everyone, a good two thirds of the seats look to be fine though I can’t guaranteed you won’t get Satan’s own audience members next to you, and indeed my companion for the evening wasn’t half as bothered about having to lean as I was. But this is my blog and so I get to bitch about whatever I like! Fortunately the play was good enough to (mostly) overcome my reservations about the space and provide a wittily anarchic, jelly-filled take on Thomas Middleton and William Rowley’s revenge tragedy classic, the second take on it in recent months on the South Bank after a less than successful version at the Southwark Playhouse. Joe Hill-Gibbins’ modern dress production is playful and insane in its portrayal of Beatrice-Joanna’s nefarious machinations in order to ensure she gets to marry the man she loves. Hiring her obsessed servant De Flores to kill the man her father wants her to marry, she thinks she’ll be free to pursue her true love Alsemero, but the fanatical nature of his love demands visceral reward which leads down the path of darkness and tragedy. Chilling stuff on the page but the staging in this warehouse-like space edges it closer to dark comedy with people being drowned in the punch bowl, murdered by fire extinguishers and using handfuls of jelly and trifle as weapons, sex aids and gore. And with the use of furniture to make entrances from, the tone could almost be farcical but the darkness of the material is never far away. Many of the ensemble double up to clever effect but Daniel Cerqueira makes a chilling De Flores with a sweaty sleaziness as he paws his mistress, Duncan Wisbey’s asylum keeper is suitably creepy and wild-haired Alex Beckett radiates an unnerving intensity. And at the centre of it all is Jessica Raine’s Beatrice-Joanna, caught up in her lustful desires and pulled further into a web of sexual intrigue than she ever imagined. Raine rises to the challenge excellently, I’ve not yet caught her in Call the Midwife, but have followed her stage work avidly and truly believe she is destined for great things. Structurally, the balance between the main strand of sex and revenge and the comic subplot set in an asylum does not feel quite right. The Southwark Playhouse junked it completely, but here it has just been trimmed but perhaps a little too much as the scenes feel a little awkward and at odds with the rest. But by and large, it doesn’t detract from the dark entertainment herein once one has become accustomed to the arresting aesthetic. On a nerdish note, I loved the mini Posh cast reunion: Henry Lloyd Hughes looking particularly fetching and Charlotte Lucas in excellent jelly-smearing form; and the mini London Road reunion with Howard Ward and Duncan Wisbey. And overall, it is a riotous piece of fun, complete with bonkers choreography from Maxine Doyle: just make sure you get there in good time to get a decent seat."
218,218,Ought To Be Clowns,06/10/2009,Ian,Judgment Day, Almeida,"Judgment Day is a play by Austro-Hungarian playwright Ödön von Horváth, which has been translated here at the Almeida theatre by Christoper Hampton. One of the first commissions after Michael Attenborough’s arrival as Artistic Director, Hampton has long been a champion of this writer and this is the first full production of this play in this country. Von Horváth wrote much of his anti-Nazi work in Germany in the 1930s, but opted to remain in the country to study the encroaching rise of Nazism, instead of fleeing like many of his compatriots such as Brecht. It’s the story of Hudetz, a stationmaster of a small village who, distracted one evening by a popular local girl eager for a kiss, fails to make the necessary signal to a passing train causing a devastating fatal crash. The girl Anna then perjures herself to defend Hudetz as he seeks to escape justice, despite his unhappy wife also witnessing the events. We then see the effects of overwhelming grief on this pair as they struggle to carry on with their lives, exacerbated by the ever-changing moods of the townspeople, whose vicious, bigoted anger seems to be refocused with every new piece of gossip that comes their way. As ever at the Almeida, the acting is uniformly superb. Joseph Millson’s stationmaster perfectly captures the essence of this broken man whose decisions lead him further and further into tragic denial, all-the-while clinging to his duty as a mantra of self-protection. Laura Donnelly delivers an incredibly assured performance as the girl whose actions set the whole play in motion, blending sensuality with fragility and then descending rapidly into a neurotic self-flagellating remorse as her guilt theatens to overwhelm her. However, all of the supporting players do fine work as the beauty of von Horváth’s characters is that they are all fully realised, no matter how minor, each wrestling with their own complicity in events and the decisions they have to make. And the use of supernumaries in several scenes gave a real authenticity to the feelings of ‘mob justice’ as the prevailing antagonisms of the small community shifted from character to character throughout the play. Every element of this production is elegantly judged (pardon the pun). The staging is quite ingenious: seemingly based on a train turntable, the set twists and turns to present the action from different sides and perspectives and has great flexibility in representing the different locations, all the while evoking the all-important railway. Be warned though, anyone with a cough should probably avoid the first few rows as there is much effective use of dry ice as the trains pass through the station. The lighting was also particularly evocative, I loved the device of spotlighting one character at the end of each scene which served the dual purpose of distracting from the scene changes but also providing deeper moments probing into the psyches of these people."
219,219,Ought To Be Clowns,20/12/2009,Ian,Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake,,"Taking the revered ballet classic that is Swan Lake, with Tchaikovsky’s iconic score, Bourne refashioned it into a modern dance piece, retaining elements of the original story, about the search for love and what people are willing to do to defend it once found, with a few key changes: adding a considerable amount of humour and most notably, recasting the flock of swans from the usual delicate ballerinas to bare-chested men in feathery breeches, thereby changing the dynamic of the central relationship making it between two men. That said, this remains a truly universal story, the need for a mother’s love and the love of a partner can be recognised and felt by people of any sexuality. This is the first revival that Matthew Bourne has been wholly involved in so there is a freshness to this production, which should even appeal to those who have seen it in recent years as some changes have been made: to the choreography, the staging, the lighting, subtle changes but important ones. And with 3 men covering the role of the Prince and 2 people covering each of the other main roles, each performance will have its own dynamic, so the company are really working hard at making this unique experience that would even bear repeat viewings during the run. Having seen him in Dorian Gray earlier this year, I was particularly pleased to get Richard Winsor playing The Swan / Stranger. This is a dream of a role for a dancer as not only do they get the romantic hero role, but they also get to play the voracious, flirtatious, leather-trouser-clad lothario of the second act, and Winsor delivers both with a fluid grace that is just enchanting to watch. In particular, the way in which he demonstrates the Swan’s love for the Prince is crystal clear, despite only having the medium of his beating wings. Christopher Marney’s Prince was good and well danced, but I would have preferred a little more subtlety in his performance, his angst-ridden face was a little too forced and brought out one too many times for my liking. Maddy Brennan’s Girlfriend is a great comedic role and she delivered it extremely well, constantly reminding us of the heart of gold underneath the ditzy blonde exterior. And finally The Queen, Nina Goldman is superb as the icy mother whose refusal to show genuine affection to her son is the heartbreaking repeated motif throughout this show, her firm resolve crumbling only when it is too late. And the swans. The image of the troupe of bare-chested men has rightly become iconic: dancing together, they are physical, comic, beautiful, threatening but always swan-like, and as they group to make an attack and let out a hiss, they are truly menacing. Conversely, the first time we see them, veiled through a screen as the Prince staggers to a park, and we hear the familiar sound of the theme from Swan Lake clearly for the first time, it is a magical moment that makes the hairs stand on end."
220,220,Ought To Be Clowns,02/12/2010,Ian,Black Watch, Barbican,"Returning to the Barbican after a highly acclaimed run in 2008, the National Theatre of Scotland’s Black Watch is in the midst of an international tour of UK and US cities with a brand new cast. Based on interviews conducted by playwright Gregory Burke with former soldiers who served in the recent conflict in Iraq, the show examines what it is to be a soldier in the modern age and what comes after. As we shift between the pool room back in Fife where they’re being interviewed by a journalist and the war zone with its armoured vehicles, makeshift shacks and lookout points, the complex truth of delivering modern warfare is exposed. And though it is set right in the middle of the war on terror, it studiously avoids moralising or coming down on one side or the other, allowing reasoned arguments on both sides. Creatively, it combines several elements to create a piece of visceral physical theatre that lingers in the memory and is clearly one of the main reasons for its continuing success: Gareth Fry’s ear-splitting sounds never let us forget the constant presence of danger in the field; Davey Anderson’s use of music allows for a reflective melancholy to be interspersed amongst scenes and Steven Hoggett’s stylised movement provides a striking beauty whether to rituals, battles, even the changing of seats in a pub, using the reconfigured space of the Barbican’s main theatre most effectively. This is truly an ensemble show and this company, including a stage debut, are excellently attuned to each other in a way that really captures and holds the attention throughout. In the more fleshed-out roles, Jack Lowden’s disillusioned Cammy and Chris Starkie’s tightly-wound and traumatised Stewarty are both superb and I liked Ian Pirie’s eloquent and dedicated Officer, fierce in his loyalty to the armed forces. But there is no doubting the camaraderie between all of these men, clearly a necessity in surviving both the boredom and the horror and subsequently dealing with the fallout once back home. Its most powerful moments for me were in the occasions when it stepped outside of the Iraq-specific context and reminded us of the unfortunate timelessness of the effects of war on soldiers and their loved ones. A beautifully mounted scene with the men reading letters with expressionistic movements could have been taken from any conflict at any time and the resignation of one of the officer’s missives back home as he bemoans the youth of so many of his soldiers, “they’re nothing more than boys…” Towards the end, the plaintive sounds of a bagpipe strikes up played by one of the company and in that moment, something just clicked in me and I completely choked up. Whether it was the emotion of the piece finally hitting home or the stirring of memories of my own Scottish maternal grandpa, who served with the Essex Yeomanry in Normandy (second from left on the pic) and my paternal granddad who served with the 53rd Welsh Reconnaissance Regiment, both of whom have now sadly passed away, but combined with the final sequence of a formation crumbling under attack yet the bond of brotherhood remaining strong as ever, it achieves something remarkable. Either way, in these final moments, Black Watch graduates from a good show to a hauntingly moving great show. ""Strong language""? I don't think your warning is quite strong enough. 😉 What I want to know is where the National Theatre of Scotland keeps finding brilliant young actors who bear a passing resemblance to Kevin McKidd."
221,221,Ought To Be Clowns,14/06/2013,Ian,The Cripple of Inishmaan, Noël Coward,           
222,222,Ought To Be Clowns,13/01/2012,Ian,Lovesong, Lyric Hammersmith,"Abi Morgan’s writing has recently has quite the prolific burst: high-profile films such as Shame and The Iron Lady and the well-regarded BBC drama The Hour and the forthcoming adaptation of Birdsong have kept her profile sky high. But she started her writing career in the theatre and following on from 27 for the National Theatre of Scotland and a short piece that formed part of Headlong’s Decade, is the achingly delicate Lovesong which is playing at the Lyric Hammersmith as part of a UK tour. A co-production with Frantic Assembly, Lovesong follows one British couple who we see at the beginning of their life together as they emigrate to the US and also much later on in their old age. But rather than opting for a straight narrative about this marriage, Morgan flits between past and present: memories are revisited and stories recollected by Billy and Maggie of their earlier lives as William and Margaret, the joys of early marriage, the struggles of trying to conceive and the disillusionments that creeps into everyday life and how they have all accumulated and translated into the relationship that they now have. Everything overlaps with great fluidity, Frantic Assembly’s customary movement is present thanks to directors Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett, and so scenes bleed into each other beautifully, entrances are made in the most imaginative ways and there’s a beautiful physicality to the choreography that is sprinkled throughout the show. Words can’t really express the sheer beauty of the images that are created: the chemistry between the couples is nicely enhanced by their dances together but there’s something that is just heartbreakingly beautiful that emerges when time blurs and the older selves interact with the younger. Truth be told, I started crying from about 10 minutes in, but seeing Siân Phillips’ Maggie tenderly dancing with Edward Bennett’s younger version of her husband after a beautifully poignant moment with some shoes was the moment that made me think I was really going to lose it and start full on sobbing! Phillips is sensational throughout, emotionally fearless and perfectly paired with Sam Cox’s Billy, forever searching for the right thing to do and it is their relationship that forms the most moving, their fight that pierces the soul. Leanne Rowe and Ed Bennett both do well at tracing the journey from idealism to realism and by the time they all come together for the stunning final montage, it is hard to imagine even the flintiest soul not being just a little bit affected. Undoubtedly there’s a degree of emotional manipulation going on here, often on a cinematic scale. Carolyn Downing’s score is all sweeping, evocative sounds and Ian William Galloway’s video design is full of artfully elegant imagery. It all works toward serving the same purpose though, to reinforce the message of the ebb and flow of love and relationships and of the desperate sadness in human fragility. Consequently, Lovesong won’t be to everyone’s taste: the overwhelming build of atmosphere leaves no escape so if you’re not feeling it from the off then that is unlikely to change and some may find it overly vague. But it really does feel that the intention here has never been to create something precise and defined; rather it is a play to be felt deeply, to let yourself be open to and to let tug unashamedly at your heartstrings. Simply beautiful. seeing Siân Phillips’ Maggie tenderly dancing with Edward Bennett’s younger version of her husband after a beautifully poignant moment with some shoes was the moment that made me think I was really going to lose it and start full on sobbing!"
223,223,Ought To Be Clowns,07/02/2016,mag9l,Time Run, London Fields,"One of my favourite discoveries last year was the plethora of escape-the-room games in London, sparked off by a trip to Time Run over in London Fields. It was a hugely enjoyable experience and you can read about it – well as much as I could say in a spoiler-free manner – in this review here. So I was delighted to get the opportunity to go back again and see if we could get any closer to completing the range of challenges that are posed for you. For the uninitiated, Time Run is a game for teams of 3-5 people, lasting an hour, in which you have to solve a quest of historic importance that stretches across time and space – think along the lines of The Crystal Maze and you’re not too far off, just with less Richard O’Brien. And it remains an excellently conceptualised piece of entertainment – from its quirky beginnings to the neat introductions to the superbly executed production values. Undoubtedly, having it done it before was something of an advantage in that it meant it took much less time to get accustomed to the type of lateral and logical thinking that you might need to do. In a similar way, it was like how I enjoyed You Me Bum Bum Train in a different manner the second time round, once that slight fear of the unknown has been conquered. That said, I was surprised how much I’d forgotten and so I wonder how much it actually helped! It certainly didn’t hinder the experience at all. Going along with different people was instructive too – me and a friend has each brought another friend who the others didn’t know and so that had its own impact of the ease of communication (which is vital if you are to succeed) – I’d definitely recommend going with people you know well. And with two runs going on in parallel, it’s nice to see that you can have a bit of interaction with another group, to compare notes, as it’s always fascinating to check out the competition/confirm you weren’t all that bad. "
224,224,Ought To Be Clowns,28/03/2014,mag9l,Jane Eyre, Bristol Old Vic,"It is hard to feel too inspired by the revivals that keep popping up in the West End – Coward has Blithe Spirit and Relative Values, Wilde’s Importance of Being Earnest is set to return soon – knowing full well that they will well-acted (by and large) but conservatively directed, playing it safe in search of the widest audience but consequently lacking any form of real inspiration. Instead, one has to look elsewhere for the kind of innovation that gets me genuinely excited about the prospect of seeing a classic on stage, in this case, Sally Cookson’s production of Charlotte Brontë’s novel Jane Eyre. The production is split into two shows but I opted for the marathon performance, the two spliced together, to minimise my travelling time and though it was quite the epic journey, I’m glad I did it as it really gave a sense of the grand sweep of the piece to do it in one go. Devised by the company, this highly musical and theatrically inventive interpretation has a wonderfully contemporary edge about it, presenting the narrative very much as we know it but teasing a freshness, a modernity of feeling about the whole affair which makes it a crying shame that it is so relatively short-lived here at the Bristol Old Vic. Madeleine Worrall’s Jane is just superb, a graceful performance that takes us from the gauche introspection of her abusive childhood through a genuinely moving search for her identity and the blossoming into maturity and acceptance of adulthood and ultimately love. But this is an ensemble show at heart, the rest of the cast covering multiple roles, acting as the Chorus, even Jane’s inner monologues and there’s physical theatre in there too, as they evoke a horse-drawn carriage, a flock of birds or a pet dog. It is highly impressive with Felix Hayes and Laura Elphinstone particular stand-outs for me."

226,226,Ought To Be Clowns,06/03/2020,Ian,LAD, VAULT Festival,"Writer/performers Alan Mahon and Rhys Dunlop’s LAD is all about Steve (Mahon), a nice enough chap who wants to work in a zoo and who’s prepping an upcoming best man’s speech. But there’s a nagging sense of trouble, he was an accountant but now he’s stacking shelves, and that nagging sense has a nagging voice, personified in toto by Dunlop, suggesting an entirely split self. And so this one-man play is actually a dialogue, between Steve’s inner and outer voices, between the attempt at social civility and a surrender to a raging toxic masculinity. As Steve edges towards getting a new girlfriend, the truth about his attitudes towards women and equality are laid bare in front of us with a brutal frankness that is equal parts hilarious and horrific. "
227,227,Ought To Be Clowns,11/11/2015,mag9l,French Without Tears, Orange Tree,"You wait years for a production of a rarely produced Rattigan comedy and sure enough, two come along at once. Kenneth Branagh has revived Harlequinade in the West End as part of his takeover of the Garrick but nipping in first was Paul Miller, putting on French Without Tears at Richmond’s Orange Tree. As with Harlequinade, one can see why these plays haven’t been produced more often and certainly more recently, they’re definitely old-fashioned in many ways but with the care they receive here, enlightening too. French Without Tears was actually Rattigan’s first major hit, set at a private language school where five bright young things are crash-learning French in order to meet the requirements for entering the diplomatic service. But the only thing on their mind is matters of the heart as the boys find their head completely and utterly turned by femme-fatale-in-the-making Diana and this putative tussle between the sexes is literally about it as the boys find solace in each other’s company as they struggle to control their urges in the face of flirtatious women."
228,228,Ought To Be Clowns,16/07/2010,Ian,Danton’s Death, National Theatre,"Danton’s Death, the 1835 play about the French Revolution by Georg Büchner, marks an impressive brace of debuts: Toby Stephens making his first bow on the stage here in the title role and Michael Grandage, Artistic Director of the Donmar, making his directorial debut here on the South Bank. Setting up in the Olivier theatre for the summer, it is part of the Travelex season so there’s been plenty of £10 seats available. This was the first preview that I saw, I acknowledge this freely but stand by everything I say here. The story is set in 1794, a period between the first and the second terrors during the French Revolution. The Committee of Public Safety has been set up in the name of the revolutionary new order and is summarily executing people whether the accusations against them are true or not. Its creator, Georges Danton, has come to regret his part in the genesis of something responsible for the killings of so many people and has been shocked at the way in which the revolution has been increasingly radicalised. His former friend and colleague Robespierre is at the head of this new faction leading the way and when Danton makes a stand for what he sees as too much, the stage is set for an almighty power struggle between the two political rivals. At the heart of the story is Danton, a character with whom I think we were meant to sympathise but I found it hard to like him. He has a conscience about his part in the revolution so far, but I never got a sense of what he had actually done or what he really stood for. This was partly due to Toby Stephens’ performance, full of swaggering arrogance but mostly due to the character, given to grand sweeping musings on the nature of existence, convinced that his popularity will save him from the guillotine and generally quite unlikeable (to me at least). I don’t think I actually like Stephens that much as an actor so I wonder how much of this is actually my prejudices, please feel free to tell me. I found the first third of the play to be rather unengaging as there were a lot of unconnected scenes, unexplained characters, painful soliloquys and little sense of drama. The scene changes were punctuated with a lot of fannying about on the gallery which quickly grew tiresome, robbed the play of a genuine sense of atmosphere and more than a couple of people around me were nodding off. Things finally sparked into action with the tribunal coming into session and the verbosity gave way a little to moments of acuity, as it became clear that Robespierre can only see violence as the way to change the world (“He who makes only half a revolution digs his own grave”) and Danton wants and needs compromise (“The revolution devours it own children”). As the shadow of death looms though, the angsty chat resumes and consequently the level of drama (and my interest) dropped. Stephens aside, I have to say I was somewhat underwhelmed by almost all the ensemble players. Only Barnaby Kay’s passionate Desmoulins and Elliot Levey’s sibilant Robespierre managed to impress me. Elsewhere there were some sadly lifeless performances, one person just shouting their lines, a complete mishmash of conflicting styles and a morass of barely there supporting characters. Some of this could be excused as first preview issues, things like the over-acting extras talking far too loud in the background can be amended, but there’s also a more serious issue in the play itself, there are just far too many poorly defined characters that make brief appearances and then rarely reappear, so there’s scarce opportunity for them to make the characters work. Most notable here is the penultimate scene featuring the wife of one of Danton’s compatriots going mad outside the prison walls, a nice enough scene but we’ve met her barely once before and little attention was paid to her so quite why she gets the grand emotional beat at the end of the play I do not know. That this is at the expense of actually featuring the more interesting characters like Robespierre, who despite being at the centre of the action from the outset, disappears never to be seen again two thirds into the play. The set looks attractive: all hexagonal with a nicely laid wooden floor and rising to great heights at the multi-entranced back, with a gallery running round and shuttered windows which are periodically opened. However, it is not the most flexible of spaces and little work is done to differentiate the locations, I had no idea we were in a prison for the first scene there. And it doesn’t utilise the space of the Olivier that well either: it forces the action into a fairly small circle in the centre of the stage and so if your seats are not central, then there’s likely to be a fair bit of back-watching going on. It just feels suited to a smaller venue. I think my attitude is typified by the finale which is quite an impressive coup de theatre, but rather than feeling any emotion at what was happening, I was just wondering ‘how did they do that’, as indeed were most of the people around me given the rise in whispering. That and marvelling at the varying pronunciations of Robespierre (should it rhyme with ‘spear’ or ‘spare’, I am none the wiser and I began to wonder if it was a running joke that I was missing, so diverse were the attempts at saying his name).So Danton’s Death was ultimately a disappointment for me, some of the issues could get better by opening night but I’m afraid I don’t think the play itself is worth even the £10 seats. Hi Ian,Danton's Death was one of my final year productions at Drama School and never got my head round it then. Have booked for the NT production in a couple of weeks to see if it makes more sense 15 years on but by the sound of it doesn't sound promising. Robes-pee-air. This is my favourite era of history so I'm holding out hope for this one. The nice man gave me a fairly central seat, so that's something anyway. XD If this was written on 15th July, I just checked and that was the very first performance. Strange time to choose to review a play. Ill be going anyway, so hope it's a smoother ride. Glen: I wonder if a little previous knowledge of the play might help. I struggled a bit to remember who everyone was, especially as so many characters are in it for such a short time, and maybe it would have helped to know that Robespierre would disappear, that really disappointed me as Levey is excellent. Hope you enjoy it though.Weez: I would have said it that way too, but Stephens rhymed it with Shakespeare more often than not. Glad you got a central seat 😉Anonymous: I refer you to the first paragraph of the review where I clearly say it was the first preview, no 'checking' required. I review it when I see it, I often see things early in the run and as a paying customer, can;t see the problem in it especially as I always mention when it is a preview that I'm seeing. And whereas some things can improve (as indeed I say at the end), a large part of my issues were with the play itself so I don't imagine the review would have been that much different had I written it in October. Went to see this tonight. A very fair a balanced view in my book… I saw this production the same night and, unbelievably, agree with all (but one) of the points in this review. A little more time spent on character relationships and dynamics and a little less on the airs and long-winded, self-indulgent soliloquies and we might all have been better off. I do disagree on the point of the spaces, it was not always clear, especially in the first half, where they were meant to be (although I definitely knew it when they were in the prison), but they were well-defined between each other and it was clear when we had re-entered previous rooms. I was vaguely pleased that you said it should have perhaps been performed in a smaller theatre, it was one of the first things I came away thinking! (Even just the Lyttelton downstairs would have been an improvement.) Excellent review, in my opinion! Saw it same night. I can understand why there was no interval as there would have been no audience for act 2. Was most cheered when they finally got guillotined. Hi I saw this on the 17th and this review is spot on (and very well written).  If anything you're a bit too understanding!  This is the National after all and i thought the script (perhaps the translation) was dire.  It was a relief when they finally shut Toby Stephens up. I saw it the same night and thought it was excellent, rivetting, dynamic and graceful at the same time.  No one near me was dozing off.  Toby Stephens' Danton reflected a man who had lived too close to death to fear it for himself but recognized his responsibility for the monster he had helped set in motion and tried to stop it.  Modern times, anyone?    He was not meant to be perfect.  I cannot bear productions in which I am aware the characters are act-ing – refuse to sit through a bad performance of anything.  I sat through this one.  Disagree wholeheartedly with the superficial assessments which appear here. Yeah, have to agree with you.  Some actors really out of their depths. Toby Stephens very inconsistant.  Not good. My theatre partner and I came away with exactly the same reactions, especially about Toby Stephens, who had neither the human concern nor the physique of Danton (there are a few references to D's height as he had a very commanding presence). We were wondering who would have given a more convincing rendering and it is difficult to think of a suitable actor. I also agree that the translation was very weak and the language quite inappropriate. Considering the interest of the subject it is quite a wonder that this production managed to make it so dull. Went to see this last night. Not my thing. Even boredom died in this play.Pitty because this part of social history is really interesting…but the play isn't. Comments of people leaving at the end were generally unfavourable. Quite right about the interval…if it had of had one I would have left. I found the first half hour confusing but once I'd established the relationship between the characters found the production compelling and beautifully staged. It's the play of a young man, full of angry rhetoric, but still worth seeing. I had thought that I was the  odd one out in finding the play confusing. I saw the earlier production in 1982 at the NT. I couldn't remember anything about it so it must have been dull then – still is. We need much more information and facts and less philosophising to make the evening comprehensible. That period of european history is incredibly important, interesting and dramatic. Sadly the extras are still grunting too much and Toby S wins no sympathy, but the shocking executions are (almost) worth the £10 ticket that I had. This review echoes my every thought about this production. A huge disappointment. I have read some wild claims about this play's greatness which on this showing are totally unfounded, or is it Brenton's version that is so totally unfocused? I could not believe in Toby Stephens' Danton for a second. Surely Gradage must have realised how the story telling is so opaque; why didn't he help the audience with some interesting staging..anything! Too much rant from beginning to end. I agree that the only question worth asking is: how did they do the head chopping? Saw this with a friend on 20th July and again I agree with everything you said – particularly the bit about Toby Stephens swaggering – it doesn't seem to matter what role he plays where he always kind of swaggers.  If anyone knows how they did the final bit please share … I saw the National's last production of the play, many years ago, with Brian Cox in the lead. I found it rather boring. Maybe it's the play itself, and no production can compensate for that. Saw the show last night and while they now seem to have a consitent view on how to pronounce 'Rose pierre' would still agree with many of your points.Toby Stephens seems to have settled into the role but the main problem lies with the piece itself that frankly is dull. The script is shorter than previous productions but the series of long speaches does little to drive forward the drama and frankly by the time Madame Guillotine arrives I didnt really care for the fate of any of them.Audience comments when leaving very dissapointing so think this will be a niche audience. I saw the show on 17th and thought it was probably the worst thing I have seen at the National. Certainly people around me seemed in agreement that it was really not good.  I felt I was being shouted at for two hours and that there were no subtleties at all. What I can't understand is the very good reviews it seems to be getting in the press. It makes you wonder whether the critics actually bother to go. Having read all of the above,I have decided not to fight tooth and nail for one of the few remaining tickets for this production next week when I will be near enough to London to make the trip financially viable.Many thanks all for a range of views that I have weighed-up and on balance, will save my theatre-going money for another production. I saw it last Friday and thought it was dull and tedious.   Really admired Toby Stephens as Mr Rochester on TV, but found his performance totally unengaging.  Some of the minor roles much better, especially Elliot Levey as Robespierre, and the actress who played Danton's wife.  Even the guillotine scene though clever was neither shocking or moving.  Try Youtube for the final scene of Poulenc's opera 'Dialogue of the Carmelites' for what a guillotine scene can be. Saw the play on 27th August.   This was almost the worst play we have seen in the Olivier.   The play was dull, the acting poor, the setting unexciting and the characters unvaried and uninteresting. Just saw the play on the 28th – thought it was quite brilliant and Elliot Levey as Robespierre was awesome. ""I’m afraid I don’t think the play itself is worth even the £10 seats."" – I suppose you mean the production rather than the play. If you're referring to the play: Have you actually read it? How many productions of the unadapted original have you seen to be able to comment on its quality?"
229,229,Ought To Be Clowns,14/05/2011,Ian,Macbeth, Everyman Liverpool,"The Everyman Theatre in Liverpool will shortly be closing for an extensive three year renovation programme which will see the building being completely rebuilt to reinvigorate the already sterling work that the Everyman and Playhouse theatres have been doing for the last few years. The final show to be mounted here is a production of Macbeth which features the return of one of its prodigal sons in the title role, David Morrissey, a Liverpudlian by birth who trained at the Everyman Youth Theatre in the early 1980s alongside Ian Hart, Mark McGann and Cathy Tyson. Originally cast alongside him to play Lady Macbeth was Jemma Redgrave but she had to withdraw due to personal reasons (one hopes that she is ok, that family has suffered enough hardship in recent times) just three weeks before the show was due to open, but fortunately Julia Ford (recently seen in Mogadishu) was able to join the cast and ensure this valedictory telling of ‘the Scottish play’ was able to continue. Despite working with the RSC as a young man, this actually marks Morrissey’s first return to Shakespeare in 17 years and in some ways it shows. His verse-speaking is not particularly subtle but his grizzly-bearded presence fills the room and he owns the stage with a gutsy, physically commanding performance, tapping into the paranoia of Shakespeare’s character extremely well – his best moment for me was on espying Banquo’s ghost. Ford was competent as his bloodthirsty wife, a much more fragile interpretation of the role which emphasised the tragedy that lay behind her actions rather than the manipulative side: an interesting choice but one which doesn’t quite go deep enough, perhaps speaking to her lack of preparatory time. There was interesting work going on in the ensemble from several of the players. Mark Arends brought a fresh-faced earnestness to Malcolm, making even Act 4 Scene 3 somewhat tolerable (which is a major achievement in my book!), aided immeasurably by Matthew Flynn’s charismatic Macduff. Richard Bremmer pulled triple duty as Duncan, a strongly comic Porter and a highly effective Doctor, sombrely dressed in Victorian garb and I also enjoyed Ken Bradshaw’s verse-speaking as Banquo and Gillian Kearney’s passionate Lady Macduff. Francis O’Connor’s set was excellently designed, making the most of all the available space, using pools of water in the floor, trapdoors and staircases to great effect and lit beautifully and atmospherically by Colin Grenfell to create a dark and dingy world. Combined with Fergus O’Hare’s sound, the creative team did well but were let down somewhat by the lack of a singular effective vision from Gemma Bodinetz’s direction. Costumes seemed randomly plucked from a huge range of time periods and locations as if to suggest the universality of the story but this interpretation did not work particularly well for me: the witches’ premonitions being delivered by plasma screen was an interesting innovation but followed up by a sword fight, it just pointed up the confused artistic direction for me."
230,230,Ought To Be Clowns,24/11/2018,Ian,The Teind, London Horror Festival at Old Red Lion,"DanGerOus” One of the more inventive entries into the London Horror Festival was ONEOHONE’s The Teind, a one-on-one interactive horror story stretching out over three weeks. Over Whatsapp, text messages, phone calls, Twitter, blogs and even face-to-face meetings, you’re drawn into a strange and slightly surreal world of darkly-tinged fairytale. As a choose-your-own-adventure, The Teind is entirely individualised (there’s at least eight different endings) and so I won’t be giving anything away about the story, that will be for you to discover when next the show emerges. But there’s still lots to talk about in Asia Osborne and Eleanor Rushton’s creation, not least the amount of invention it contains. Though the show is designed to be fully interacted with, it can cope with differing levels of interaction, indeed you could just let it happen to you with no interaction at all. But there’s so much fun to be had in diving headfirst into the myriad ways in which this story has been constructed, every choice revealing new pathways, every brain-wracking puzzle sending you further down the rabbit-hole. And it was all rather good fun and disturbingly addictive. The freedom to do as much as you like really works well – I started off fully engaged, tailed off a bit when life events overtook for a bit, but by the time deadlines were arriving, I was frantically WhatsApping and desperately bargaining away the…well, that would be telling!"
231,231,Ought To Be Clowns,31/03/2013,Ian,Gibraltar, Arcola,"In the midst of the Troubles, the 1988 shooting of three Provisional IRA terrorists outside a petrol station in the rocky outcrop of Gibraltar might have just been one amongst many atrocities but a number of factors conspired to turn it into an even more controversial event. Alastair Brett – a former Sunday Times lawyer who was intimately connected to the media storm that erupted – has co-written Gibraltar with Sian Evans, to relook at the killings and the press coverage that followed to examine the point where journalistic ethics crossed swords with both the British political establishment and the IRA itself to become responsible for, they argue, a huge obfuscation of the truth. But the resulting play, and James Robert Carson’s production of it which currently sits in the smaller of the Arcola’s studios, is as rough as the bare brick of the theatre’s walls. An uncertainty about the play’s dramatic purpose is evident from the outset. Based as it is on real events and using the direct testimony from Parliamentary debates, legal offices and official reports from police and magistrates, Gibraltar seems to spring from the verbatim tradition, a feeling reinforced by short scenes and the small company covering a multitude of different roles. But bolted onto this is a contemporaneous, fictionalised retelling of events from the journalistic perspective – the seasoned old hack contrasted with the ambitious eager rookie – trying to demonstrate how their varied attempts to pursue the best story possible and/or uncover the truth play out. And it’s an extraordinary move for a piece that values the notion of truth, both in its abstract form and in its stone-cold reality, so very highly. In one moment, one is sifting through the evidence of what actually happened; the next, we’re watching an interpretation of events from a viewpoint of questionable subjectivity which is ostensibly fictionalised but so closely linked to the real version that the division is blurred. And so it is never clear what the main intention of Gibraltar is. Is it to scrutinize the practice of investigative journalism or is it to push us closer to a better understanding of the circumstances around the event in question, is it even to give us a flavour of life in Gibraltar – sadly it achieves neither particularly well with a clumsy script that relies far too much on repetition of ideas than elucidation. Carson demonstrates a far too loose touch in manoeuvring the constant shifts of the narrative, the uneasy mix of fact and fiction, and so there is rarely the vibrant push of a story that needs to be told And this hesitancy also comes across in the company: there’s convincing work from Greer Dale-Foulkes as the keen young documentary maker but of the four actors, only Karina Fernandez succeeds in strongly delineating the various roles, most notably as the key witness whose unique version of events skews the entire affair. Cordelia Chisholm’s bare-bones design of suspended television screens starts off as an effective device but the clarity of its purpose is inexplicably made murky with a thankfully brief but extremely ill-advised trip into expressionistic video work."

234,234,Ought To Be Clowns,14/06/2010,Ian,Ghost Story, Riverside Studios,"The second play in the Sky Arts Playhouse: Live project is Ghost Story, written and directed by Mark Ravenhill and featuring an amazing cast of Juliet Stevenson, Lesley Manville and Lyndsey Marshal. Stevenson plays Lisa, a breast cancer sufferer who has come to visit Meryl (Manville), a healer who believes in the curative power of positive thought. Then, as the programme says “as time folds back on itself, Lisa and Meryl cross the line between the healer and the healed and discover that the world is full of ghosts”. On one level, this is a satire on the doctrine of positive thinking, questioning how real or effective it could possibly be in the fight against terminal illness, posing serious questions but also playing it for laughs, the scene in which Lisa is encouraged to draw what her cancer looks like on the wall of the apartment is brilliant (I thought it looked like an evil frog) and wryly amusing (it then gains a penis, and pubic hair). It is also though a poignant account of people’s battles with illness, how it affects relationship with the self and the loved ones around us. It is particularly moving in the way it depicts the lies and half-truths we have to tell to protect others or even our own egos: all the characters obfuscate the truth at some point or other. As cancer sufferer Lisa, Juliet Stevenson captures the fragility of the victim of a harsh disease, desperate to find any way out to recovery, but also plays beautifully the inner strength that this woman does not initially know she possesses, but soon comes to light once she begins to ‘work on herself’. Stevenson plays this journey with imperceptible changes, it is such a natural progression yet the woman who takes a seat at the end of the play is barely recognisable from the victim who we see at the beginning: a stunning performance. Lesley Manville is also superb as Meryl, the healer to whom Lisa turns, seemingly something of a con-artist, full of cagey therapist double-speak and cognitive exercises. But her smooth exterior is soon ruffled as connections form between the two women and boundaries are crossed. Manville plays these questioning scenes with a heartbreaking intensity and her work in the latter half was unflinchingly brutal in its honesty. Lyndsey Marshal has quite the job in matching such incredible performers but she does well in portraying the needy Hannah, Meryl’s rather self-obsessed lover, not quite able to face up to the reality of any situation, another character tied up in overly reflective therapist speak. Working within the box-like frame that has been set up for all the plays to be performed in (or so it seems), the action takes place in the living room of the healer. But as the show progresses and the planes that the characters inhabit shift, the space outside of the box is cleverly utilised. Chloe Lamford’s design is immeasurably helped by Will Charles’ lighting in subtly but clearly evoking these changing viewpoints, both in time and space."
235,235,Ought To Be Clowns,15/11/2009,Ian,Marilyn and Ella,,"After a run last year at the Theatre Royal Stratford, Marilyn & Ella arrives in the West End, playing for five shows over three consecutive Sundays at the Apollo Theatre. Written by Bonnie Greer, recently seen giving Nick Griffin short shrift on BBC 1’s Question Time, this is essentially a two-hander which explores the friendship and connections between Marilyn Monroe and Ella Fitzgerald. This revival is also quite timely as this month marks the 75th anniversary of Fitzgerald’s debut in a theatre in Harlem which lead to a long, illustrious career. In 1955, Marilyn Monroe was responsible for convincing the owners of a major Hollywood nightclub, the Mocambo, to book Ella Fitzgerald for a five night run at a time when racial segregation was still the norm. A friendship was thus born and parallels are drawn, if not always successfully, between each woman’s struggles: Monroe’s efforts to reinvent herself as a serious actor and Ella’s daily battles against racism. The play is mostly delivered in monologues by each character, with only a few scenes in the second half played together, perhaps betraying this play’s roots in radio. The action is interspersed with songs from the Great American Songbook, which sometimes served to illustrate the action but also sometimes seemed randomly selected in order to shoehorn in a well-known song (see ‘The Lady Is A Tramp’).
The staging is minimal with just two chairs, and a large mounted picture frame on the rear wall, which changes once to indicate the location and then finally to reveal a real photograph of the two legends. However, Warren Wills’ jazz quartet are also placed onstage which adds a vital energy to the show, under Wills’ superb musical direction. There’s some great arrangements of the classic songs which add freshness to some well-worn old favourites, but the band also provide some beautiful incidental music throughout, and the most incredibly authentic sounding phone ringing, as played on the piano, which has to be heard to be believed.
 Hope Augustus’ Ella Fitzgerald is the main star of the show: she has the lion’s share of the performances, a beautiful rendition of ‘Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered’, and the famous improv around ‘Mack The Knife’ were the highlights of the whole evening, and Augustus wisely steered clear of straight impersonations, instead allowing for her own interpretations to be sufficiently inspired by Fitzgerald. She does however also appear onstage intermittently throughout the show as herself, commenting on Ella’s situation, a device which as well as being completely unnecessary, was very clumsily directed by Colin McFarlane as it was never immediately apparent when these sections started or ended. Suzie Kennedy’s Marilyn Monroe felt underpowered by comparison, her musical numbers were competent, but lacked the oomph to match her fellow performer. And whilst her portrayal of Monroe is uncanny, or maybe even because of this, she struggled to give Marilyn any real dramatic impact onstage, especially when espousing on civil rights issues. In their main scene together though, their first ever meeting, they spark off each other showing the two all-too-human figures behind the showbiz legends to great effect, and it is a shame that in a play about their friendship, this is one of the few times their characters actually interact. An unexpected addition was Stephen Triffitt as Frank Sinatra. Originally slated to provide pre-show entertainment, he took the stage to give us a number that introduced the show, reappeared in the show introducing Ella’s first show after singing a song himself, and then reappeared once more for a rendition of ‘New York, New York’ at the finale which was little short of cringeworthy, especially as he hogged all the vocals. In a show which is called Marilyn & Ella, Sinatra’s presence on stage ended up feeling very intrusive."
236,236,Ought To Be Clowns,09/06/2016,mag9l,By The End Of Us, Southwark Playhouse,"Video games and immersive theatre are something of a natural Venn diagram – manoeuvring around a world constructed entirely for your benefit. Block Stop’s latest production, By The End Of Us is a “Live Video Game: a video game performed by live actors, controlled by you”, with the action taking place simultaneously in The Little of the Southwark Playhouse and in what appear to be the Vaults of Waterloo Station. It’s an ambitious gambit, albeit not one that always pays off. In the game, two protagonists are simultaneously playing at cross-purposes. The assassin, Mia Culper (say it out loud) is controlled by the Single Player, a sole audience member sequestered away from the auditorium. Sam, a security guard, is controlled by an electronic popular vote by the members of the audience. Mia must assassinate a target, Sam must prevent her from achieving her goal. The game opens with a slickly-produced short film (or ‘cutscene’, if we’re really going for this) introducing Mia, Sam, and the target. The action then unfolds as Mia attempts to make her way to her target and Sam conspires to stop her by any means necessary. The publicity material boasts that there are no pre-coded or pre-scripted events at work in By The End of Us, although this felt painfully evident during the performance I attended. Characters meant to be unaware of each others’ presence were stood two feet apart, pretending not to see each other. The seeming lack of rules resulted in some illogical outcomes – at one point a character bumped into a wall and lost 20% of her health bar (yes there are health bars). Unfortunate technology issues meant the live feed connecting us to the action dropped out frequently. Any game or piece of theatre is at its most exciting when you’re not quite sure what else it has up its sleeve. By The End of Us attempts to adhere to this creed by appearing to be genuinely open-ended. We have an initial scenario with a few twists along the way, and together the audience and cast make it through to the end. But it just feels too loose. That’s not to say it’s not entertaining. The varying acting ability on display may prevent total immersion, but the cast are game for improvisation, and generated quite a few laughs in the auditorium. While the atmosphere in the auditorium was wholly jovial, there were however times when the laugh felt very much at the expense of the production. When the show was over (in this playthrough the target was assassinated), it ended with little fanfare, and no ending ‘cutscene’ to bookend the action, which felt like an oversight."
237,237,Ought To Be Clowns,12/04/2020,Ian,Daddy, Almeida Theatre,"Like all right-minded people, I was particularly gutted to be missing Daddy at the Almeida Theatre due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Jeremy O Harris’ play made waves in New York last year and was a hotly anticipated arrival. If you so desire, you can read any number of reviews from the USA but I am reliably informed that it’s best to go in as blind as possible which is what I still intend to do.

238,238,Ought To Be Clowns,13/06/2015,mag9l,A Damsel in Distress, Chichester Festival Theatre,"It’s no secret at all that I love a good old-fashioned musical but it is hard to feel that we need more of them in the world. PG Wodehouse’s A Damsel in Distress started life as a novel in 1919, has been adapted on both stage (with Ian Hay) and screen, where it was augmented by a suite of songs by George and Ira Gershwin, and now finds itself as a piece of musical theatre with a new book by Jeremy Sams and Robert Hudson and vibrantly directed and choreographed by Rob Ashford.  With a cast that contains Richard Dempsey, Isla Blair, Nicholas Farrell, Sally Ann Triplett, plus the requisite Strallen (Summer, in this case), there’s little about which to complain. Yet I find myself grumbling a little, the bar at Chichester has been set so extraordinarily high with their recent successes, that even a very good production can seem a little lacklustre by comparison. And with so many great ‘traditional’ musicals of this form in the canon, do we really need new ones to be constructed?  The plot revels in its silliness in the archetypal England of Wodehouse’s writings. At the Savoy Theatre, Perkins want his American director George Bevan to make the show they’re putting on more fun and over in Gloucestershire, Lady Caroline Byng is determined to make her niece Maud Marshmoreton marry her son Reggie to secure the family estate and its turreted towers. Maud runs away and falls head over heels for George when they meet by chance but in order for their romance to work, there’s many an obstacle to overcome and of course, they gotta put on a show! It is largely daffy and delightful and naturally, brilliance abounds in part. Christopher Oram’s set design is a consistently inspired piece of work (if a little over-reliant on the lifts); Nicholas Farrell is an unexpected treasure as he proves it’s never too late to fall in love; Sam Harrison (so beloved from his Salad Days) shines in the company; Richard Dempsey’s twittish Reggie (he of the poached egg song…) is adorable; Isla Blair’s redoubtable Lady Caroline is fiercely dragon-like; Sally Ann Triplett is back!; the list really does go on and on. But a story needs to be more than entertaining sub-plots and the central romance of George and Maud never really clicked into gear for me. Fleeshman is perfectly serviceable as the director dreaming of art over entertainment but Maud suffers from some severe under-writing by Wodehouse/Hay/Sams/Hudson (men, all of them) and Strallen plays her with too much of a cold distance for us ever to take Maud into our hearts as a leading lady to truly root for. "
239,239,Ought To Be Clowns,03/06/2015,mag9l,The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare’s Globe,"Following the exceptional Rupert Goold/RSC adaptation which played the Almeida over Christmas, it seemed a brave decision for the Globe to also lead their 2015 season with The Merchant of Venice but Jonathan Munby’s production proves to be just as revelatory, albeit in a completely different way. With Jonathan Pryce making his debut here at this venue, accompanied by his daughter Phoebe no less, it is no surprise that his beautifully realised Shylock is at the heart of the show here but it is also good to see Jessica (played by Pryce junior, natch) also take her turn in the spotlight. In some ways, this echoes the Al Pacino version, showing us how Jessica is cruelly caught in the middle – torn between duty to her father and her Jewish faith, and the delight that a genuine love match with Ben Lamb’s Christian Lorenzo brings to her life. This conflict is fiercely felt – she argues ferociously in Yiddish with her father but there’s no doubting the haunting anguish of the production’s end, her Hebrew lament powerfully affecting as Shylock faces yet another disgrace as we’re reminded that – even if she has shunned him – it is still a familial bond being sundered here. And as Shylock, Pryce is just superb – sombrely understated but intriguingly complex, he is a completely natural stage presence that is just mesmerising to watch. Playing the persecuted victim, he provokes a shocking degree of violence about his person but lest we sympathise too much, he’s instantly tyrannical once behind closed doors. As his hubris is allowed full rein in the courtroom, we know that pride must come before a fall but the ending here is just flawless, an interpretation that sears itself onto the memory and makes you question how the play has ever worked before."
240,240,Ought To Be Clowns,05/08/2011,Ian,The Hired Man, Landor,"The Hired Man was Howard Goodall’s first musical, setting Melvyn Bragg’s story of turn-of-the-century everyday rural Cumbrian life to a score inspired by Kurt Weill but primarily influenced by English choral and folk music. Based on events that happened to Bragg’s grandfather, the plot revolves around farmhand John Tallentine, his wife Emily and their family during a period of considerable social and economic upheaval as agriculture declines, pit mining advances and the shadow of the First World War threatens everything and everyone. Though the scope of the story is huge, taking in a significant chunk of British social history, it is actually intimately told by focusing in on this single family and how the larger events impact their daily lives. In this respect, Andrew Keates’ production at the Landor is a great match of venue and material as we are taken right into the heart of this story and the struggles of its tightly-knit society to find just a little daily happiness as they work the land whether through a pie and a pint in the local or breaking marriage vows. Niall Bailey’s band of piano and strings is perfectly suited to the graceful swells of Goodall’s score and the decision not to stint on the ensemble pays great dividends as the rich sound created by the 17 cast members is just gorgeous to listen to as melody lines harmonise and counterpoint each other. There’s a real elegance to Goodall’s compositions which is matched by consistently strapping performances across the main roles: Joe Maxwell’s strong-voiced, dependable John, Martin Neely and Sean-Paul Jenkinson as his brothers and Ian Daniels’ seductive Jackson. There’s a surfeit of beards and tweed in the predominantly male company and pleasingly so, it brings a real earthy tone to the show that should confound musical naysayers but also lends an authenticity to the emotion of the piece. The vast scope of the backgrounding context does mean that some story points are dealt with rather cursorily as we sweep through time, equally this means that a healthy pace is maintained. And in Freya Groves’ open design which maximises the playing space yet still atmospherically and gloomily lit by Howard Hudson, this powerful, moving, intimately epic story brings history to vivacious, personal life and proves itself a truly great, British musical. Great review: this really is a show that deserves more attention and a bigger audience. This is exciting British musical theatre that is worthy of the West End instead of all these jukebox nonsensities and though it is great to get the intimacy on the fringe, I hope it isn't too tucked away.J"
241,241,Ought To Be Clowns,15/12/2011,Ian,The Ladykillers, Gielgud,"After having been surprisingly seduced by Noises Off into properly liking a farce for the first time, my hopes for The Ladykillers were raised. I have to admit to never having seen an Ealing comedy in my life and so didn’t have any clue what I was about to see, other than that it was going some kind of madcap comedic evening. The story has been adapted for the stage by Graham Linehan – he of Father Ted and The IT Crowd – and I am reliably informed that far from being a faithful representation of the original film, it is a brand new take on the plot which follows its own route. Set in Mrs Wilberforce’s house in King’s Cross, the play takes place over a few days late in 1956 as she lets her spare room to the kindly-seeming Professor Marcus, leader of a string quintet who need the rehearsal space. She is blissfully unaware that he’s actually the head honcho of a gang of criminals who are using the prime location as the base for their next big train heist, but things don’t go quite according to plan to amusing (albeit intermittently for me) effect. Linehan’s approach has been to create extremes of character, so everything is exaggerated for comedic effect, the quirky characteristics of each of the robbers proving to be essentially definitive, lending things something of a sitcom edge. Ben Miller’s psychotic Romanian was my criminal of choice, raising laughs with every single exasperated glance, and there’s good work too from Stephen Wight as the chemically-dependent and variable Harry, Clive Rowe’s simpleton One-Round and James Fleet’s would-be cross-dressing Major. Sean Foley’s production emphasises these absurdities which consequently edged things a little too close to farce for my comfort, where I thought the darker tone, suggested by the turn of events in the second half, might have been better explored. Peter Capaldi is strong though as Marcus, slyly manipulative and seductively charming as he insinuates his way into Mrs Wilberforce’s affections, and marshalling his motley crew with skill, whether in determining roles in the heist or in conducting them in an impromptu performance as they are caught out in their deception and have an audience waiting to hear them play (a highly amusing scene). And Marcia Warren as the initially hoodwinked landlord has a grace and strength, alongside a little battiness, that ensures we’re always rooting for her."
242,242,Ought To Be Clowns,14/09/2020,Ian,Freaking Free Mark DeFriest, Bread and Roses Theatre,"Chances are you won’t have heard of the name Mark DeFriest. A man in the US who, in 1980, took the tools promised to him by his late father pre-probate and ended up with a custodial sentence for his pains from which he has never broken free, despite developing a reputation as a notorious jailbreaker. Freaking Free Mark DeFriest offers up a highly theatrical version of his lifestory, exploring his mental health issues exacerbated bu his incarceration. Structurally, the play takes the form of short vignettes, shifting around in time and varying significantly in form which if nothing, certainly keeps the audience on its toes. From quiz shows asking for our participation to enact justice to prison correspondence that riffs on Eminem and Dido’s ‘Stan’, there’s certainly no lacking of ideas from Eyles. What isn’t always abundantly obvious is a clarity of intent. The play frequently nudges towards Kafka-esque notions of absurdism as it travels the various circles of hell of the American justice system. But its satirical bite isn’t quite sharp enough to fully follow through and this all comes at the expense of delving into DeFriest as a character – he remains a frustratingly elusive figure here. Sharing the role with Jay O’Connell, Louie Threlfall throws himself wholeheartedly into all this theatrical business but has little opportunity to mine the tragedy of the ongoing situation, to make us feel for DeFriest. And Warren Graham and Georgina Squires adroitly cover any number of supporting roles though few are allowed to break through into the wider consciousness."
243,243,Ought To Be Clowns,02/11/2017,Ian,Nativity! The Musical, Birmingham Rep,"Just like a wise man, I came late to Nativity, only getting round to watching Debbie Isitt’s film a couple of years ago but oh, how it won me over, feeling like an instant Christmas classic. (The less said about the sequel and the shocking third film, the better). So it was little surprise to hear that Isitt was adapting her film for the stage, in the form of Nativity! The Musical. And though I have once again embraced my inner Scrooge and won’t be reviewing much, if any, festive fare this year, I couldn’t resist the chance to sparkle and shine. And I’m glad I did, even if it is a full month too early to be even thinking of anything Christmassy. Nativity remains a beautifully heart-warming story and if anything, has even more of a feel-good factor about it through all the liveness of this production. The story centres on Coventry primary school St Bernadette’s, trying to escape Ofsted-imposed special measures by beating a rival school to putting on the best Christmas show which, through the most tenuous of links, might just attract Hollywood interest and get turned into a film. It’s a bit of stuff and nonsense really but done with as much charm as it is here, it’s like sinking into a nice mug of hot chocolate with marshmallows melted on the top. The cheeky chirpiness of the child performers, one of three teams of nine local schoolchildren, is irresistible as they badger their teacher (Daniel Boys’ rather reserved Mr Maddens) into directing them and respond to the inimitable Mr Poppy’s enthusiasm (Simon Lipkin perfectly cast as the most unlikely of teaching assistants) to find their (sometimes deeply) hidden talents. Isitt serves as director and this has its strengths and its weaknesses. Little has been done to amend the plot which is fine, but does mean that Maddens’ LA-headed girlfriend Jennifer remains under-utilised and a firmer hand at the tiller might usefully have trimmed 20 minutes or so from the slightly indulgent running time. But she also marshals her resources to the beautifully judged telling of her story. Andrew Wright’s joyous choreography is an explosion of homespun fun and David Woodhead’s imaginative design looks a treat for a touring show."

Some things were unquestionably out of their control, like the disruption of cast illness, but others were not. The apparent development of the show from a dance-led piece to a full-blown musical did not happen overnight and so to cite that as an excuse for the piece not being ready, to reclassify the production as a work-in-progress midway through the run is disingenuous to say the least, especially when people are still being charged £45 to see it. It is a piece that is bounding with potential, clicking into a theatre landscape in London which feels unusually switched on at the moment (Misty and Emilia to name but two kicks up its backside), but we do still feel like we’re in rough draft territory here, hence my decision not to review. (It has provoked some strange reactions in the press though – four stars from Billers? Time Out showing their ass about colour-blind casting?) The music by Josh Cohen and DJ Walde and the book by Kate Prince and Priya Parmar both need substantial refinement from its baggy three hours plus, but you can see the work being put in, and which will continue to be put in until Sylvia re-emerges (next year apparently) better equipped to smash that patriarchy."
245,245,Ought To Be Clowns,28/10/2013,Ian,Black Jesus, Finborough,"The investigation of war crimes in Africa has already had one intriguing exploration on London’s stages this year in the excellent A Human Being Died That Night at the Hampstead but where that play focused on South Africa, Anders Lustgarten’s Black Jesus looks at contemporary Zimbabwe, the damage that Robert Mugabe’s regime has inflicted, and the possibilities of reaching any kind of resolution when the scars of conflict cut so deep. It is set in the near future, where a Truth and Justice Commission has been set up to explore the crimes of the past. Eunice Ncube (the excellent Debbie Korley) is tasked with interviewing Gabriel (Paapa Essiedu, in a rich vein of form at the moment) one of the key members of a brutal youth militia movement called the Green Bombers, who crushed untold enemies with violence and remains a thoroughly intimidating figure. What Lustgarten identifies though is that none of this happens in a vacuum. The politics of a country that simultaneously needs to deal with the past, yet also get on everyday business, is densely complex, especially when almost everyone concerned has their own connections to what happened and in the form of the oleaginous civil servant Moyo (Cyril Nri also very strong), the necessity of compromise – however much it sticks in the craw – is made real."

247,247,Ought To Be Clowns,16/11/2016,mag9l,The Sewing Group, Royal Court,"When I was at primary school, we did a thing in needlepoint where we sewed seemingly random shapes in a line and only when we’d finished and Mrs Holcroft (I think it was) told us to look at the spaces inbetween, did we see that we’d made a handicraft tribute to Jesus. That’s still the first thing I think of when I think of sewing and there’s a tenuously similar link of ‘do you see what it is yet’ to The Sewing Group, EV Crowe’s new play for the Royal Court. Stewart Laing’s production opens in the bare timber of a log cabin where two women are sewing. Enigmatically short scenes, sometimes containing just a single glance, interspersed with total blackouts offer tantalising threads to follow – an outsider joins this rural community but her mere presence in the group soon becomes a disruption, leading to more than just dropped stitches in the slow and increasingly strange unfolding of the story. Crowe is clearly interested in the dynamics of female groups and in this pre-industrial moment, in simpler times somewhere in the 1700s, there’s a fascinating look at the role that this kind of relentless sewing work played in communities where women picked up a needle as often as we pick up our iPhones today. Thus it asks questions about who we are and how we spend our time and how technological advances have impacted on that."
248,248,Ought To Be Clowns,21/04/2018,Ian,The Prudes, Royal Court,"As The Prudes is still in previews and given the nature of the way Anthony Neilson works, I ain’t gonna write a review but just offer up these images as an obscure preview."
249,249,Ought To Be Clowns,26/06/2015,mag9l,King John, Shakespeare’s Globe,"One of the terms most overused by reviewers and publicity writers alike is “timely revival” and this production of King John is no different, coinciding with the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta as it has processed on a mini-candelit-tour of Temple Church and Holy Sepulchre Church Northampton ahead of this run at the Globe. But Shakespeare dropped the ball here with this play, it is no surprise in the watching that it is one of his lesser-performed works and though James Dacre’s production has its bright spots, it can’t cover all of its inherent weaknesses. Dacre heavily plays up the religious aspects of the play and whilst you can see the logic for the sacred venues and the atmosphere that the candlelight would have created, it’s less easy to see how it works as well at a sunny matinée in the open air on Bankside. Jonathan Fensom’s design imposes a red cross of a stage into the space and fills it with monks, but religion is only part of the story of John’s travails and weighting the emphasis so heavily here doesn’t seem to make a huge deal of dramatic sense (though I freely admit to not knowing the play at all well). The set comes into its own in demonstrating the oppositions that make up the meat of the play – John against his nobles with their wavering loyalties, John against the papal envoy who would replace him as king, England versus France, the mother of the king versus the mother of his rival, and also in spelling out clearly who is on which side at any certain point. This clarity is much welcomed but it rarely piques the interest in a meaningful way and an excruciatingly long first act proved to be a most arduous hurdle to overcome. "
250,250,Ought To Be Clowns,09/09/2017,Ian,Eyes Closed, Ears Covered,"The latest copy of the Beano, an illicit jar of Marmite and a day trip to Brighton – the stuff of the best kind of childhood memories. So even though they’re bunking off school, now-teenage best pals Seb and Aaron are onto something in trying to recreate the magic. But something’s not quite right, something’s not quite the same, and given that the play starts with Aaron being questioned by a police officer, something’s most definitely up. Alex Gwyther’s Eyes Closed, Ears Covered is beautifully put together in the way that it reveals just what that is – exploring the intersection of past trauma on present behaviour, questioning the durability of the human spirit and the lengths it will go to try to survive. Tightly constructed by Gwyther and directed with real suspense by Derek Anderson, its a powerful addition to the programme at the Bunker Theatre as its first birthday fast approaches. Given the lightning-fast switches between past and present, Anderson’s team of creatives respond to the challenge brilliantly. Jonnie Riordan’s movement work helps Danny-Boy Hatchard’s Aaron and Joe Idris-Roberts’ Seb to capture much of the ungainly physicality of adolescence, the awkwardness with which growing boys occupy their space in the world, emotionally as well as physically. The work is here is deceptively simple but they’re utterly convincing. And there’s something of this hinterland between boy and man in the sparseness of Alyson Cummins’ design with its unassuming set of grey blocks, shifted around to make a train carriage, a police station, a bedroom. In this constant activity, you can’t help but be reminded of boys at play, the long-forgotten innocence proving impossible to recapture, crucial thematic reinforcement thus threaded throughout every beat of the production.  Hatchard’s persuasive Aaron bubbles with scarcely repressed anger, so much more than teenage rage hinting at the darkness to come. The post-interval arrival of Phoebe Thomas’ beautifully compassionate Lily heightens the stakes and tightens the screw almost unbearably under the shadow of domestic violence. And Joe Idris-Roberts (who’ll be Pinocchio for the National’s big Christmas musical) is stunning as the hammer-blow of the climax strikes, as the full complexity of what has happened, of what is still happening, reveals itself. One to keep your eyes open for!"
251,251,Ought To Be Clowns,05/10/2013,Ian,Farragut North, Southwark Playhouse,"Beau Willimon may now be better known for his screen work – he was head writer on the Netflix House of Cards and also penned Oscar-nominated film The Ides of March – but he started in the theatre and that film was actually based on a play, Farragut North. Its contemporary Washington machinations are based on his own experiences working on a failed presidential campaign but as with so many takes on modern politics, the shadow of the real thing looms large. Stephen Bellamy is a highly ambitious political campaigner, working for a major candidate for the Democrat party’s presidential nomination and at the age of 25, already a seasoned old hand of 10 years’ experience. But in the world of spin, people are more concerned about scoring the advantage rather than doing the decent thing and the trust and loyalty that Stephen cared so little for on the way up the greasy pole, bites back with a vengeance on the way down. The play is entertaining enough but rather schematic in the end, there’s little that genuinely surprises and it does begin to feel somewhat predictable, lacking the cutting edge that would make it zing off the stage. Guy Unsworth’s production tries its best to infuse a Mamet-like sharpness but despite the best efforts of his cast, it never quite achieves that level. The plot twists and turns pleasingly, demonstrating the cyclical nature of this world, but the proselytising does wear thin. "
252,252,Ought To Be Clowns,19/01/2019,Ian,Songs for Nobodies, Ambassadors Theatre,"An impressive transfer sees one-woman show Songs for Nobodies move into the Ambassadors Theatre from a run last year at Wilton’s Music Hall and it is a striking, if ultimately a little slight, evening. Joanna Murray-Smith’s play links together five vignettes which feature ordinary people – the ‘nobodies’ – who find themselves in the orbit of legendary performers.  And in the hands of Australian performer Bernadette Robinson, we not only get to hear their stories but listen to performances from the stars – Garland, Cline, Piaf, Holiday, Callas – in a truly virtuosic turn that ends on an operatic high. It is a thrilling sensation to watch Robinson switch effortlessly but oh so effectively into these iconic divas and she sounds amazing as all. "
253,253,Ought To Be Clowns,18/06/2014,mag9l,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Theatre Royal Drury Lane,"Third time lucky for me and the great glass elevator! The first time I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, the climactic lift effect wasn’t ready, the second time it broke down before it even really started so if nothing else, it was great to finally get to see the sequence as it was intended. My main reason for revisiting the show though was the cast change, with favourites like Josefina Gabrielle and Richard Dempsey joining the company and Alex Jennings stepping into the role of Willy Wonka, replacing Douglas Hodge.  And rather unexpectedly, I absolutely loved it. It was a show I had previously liked rather than truly enjoyed but it really seems to have settled into its skin now, subtle alterations helping with the pace (although I am sad to see the animated prologue having been removed) and a generally sharper feel to the whole proceeding. For me though, the best aspect was Jennings’ reinterpretation of Wonka, a completely new take on the character that works brilliantly and feeds into the fabric of David Greig’s book, based on Roald Dahl’s writings of course, in a more instinctive and convincing manner. Jennings imbues Wonka with a thoroughly English sense of eccentricity, toning down the malevolence that Hodge seemed to revel in for more of an absent-minded, carefree attitude that works better. He still has abrasive edges but there’s a core warmth there that makes for a much stronger and more affecting central relationship with good old Charlie Bucket (played by Oliver Finnegan tonight). There’s more of a frailty there too which makes perfect sense given the way the story unfolds towards the end, retirement feels like a genuine option throughout rather than a plot device. Coming back to a show, particularly one that might carry large preconceived notions given the popularity of the source material, also gives one the opportunity to really appreciate it for what it is. It is different to the film(s) and the book, it possesses its own special brand of magic (special mention to Jamie Harrison’s illusions) and musically, it is stronger than Marc Shaiman’s score is usually given credit for. His tunes insinuate their way into the mind rather than bash you over the head and there’s a sweetness, especially in the first half, that shouldn’t be underestimated."
254,254,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2013,Ian,The Pride, Trafalgar Studios,"It’s a play I have loved for a long time now and so it is hard for me to be objective about it. The earlier sequences are reminiscent of Rattigan at his best, every line weighted with repressed emotion as the men surrender to their illicit (and illegal) attraction. And the modern day story speaks of the struggles of identity in today’s hyper-sexualised culture, at a Pride festival where the only real battle being fought is to get to the front of a long bar queue and where the main threat to happiness appears to be Grindr. In both worlds too, the presence of Sylvia is infinitely moving – in the 50s she’s just as trapped by society’s rules as her gay husband and as the contemporary best friend, she has to fight just as hard to live her own emotional life due to Oliver’s clingy nature.  Al Weaver is excellent as both Olivers, subtly suggesting that the emotional damage inflicted upon him in the past has repercussions in the modern day with an easily bruised but appealing sensitivity; Harry Hadden-Paton is achingly moving as the troubled Philips, desperate to be loved simply; and as the pair of Sylvias, Hayley Atwell is sensational, generating worlds of empathy with her sparking personalities. Throw in Mat Horne’s amusing set of cameos from a Nazi-dressed rent boy to a wideboy news editor, and it is all excellently put together, Jamie Lloyd’s obvious affection for the piece evident throughout. Soutra Gilmour’s design of a giant gilded mirror is affected though the simple staging does seem to miss the ‘Trafalgar Transformed’ brief. "

256,256,Ought To Be Clowns,17/09/2008,Ian,Her Naked Skin, National Theatre,"Set in the Suffragette Movement in London in 1913 with excitement in the air as victory can be tasted, but times have never been more frenzied or dangerous as militant tendencies are at their strongest and many women are experiencing jail time on a regular basis. Lenkiewicz pitches the continuance of this struggle against the more personal story of Lady Celia Cain, bored in life and with her traditional marriage and family, who launches into a passionate lesbian love affair with a much younger, much more lower-class seamstress whom she shares a cell with and soon much more. As the affair hots up, so too does the political climate as emancipation comes closer to becoming a reality. It is so effective on so many levels: the horrors faced by the women in prison, included a most brutal instance of force-feeding that is seared on the memory; the struggle against the establishment that they faced in trying to get their message across, resorting even to violence; the changing political climate with even men publicly calling for women to be given the vote. On top of all of that though is the class struggles that nevertheless persisted and one wonders if it would have been the lesbianism or the social mismatch that would have caused the most scandal in Celia’s social circle. It is a heady mix but one which captivates. Lesley Manville is perfect as the upper class Celia, ruthless in her pursuit of what she wants both on the personal and political scale and so very brittly effective. Jemima Rooper’s piece of rough Eve plays off her well, habitually out of her depth with her love who is more experienced in love, in life, in everything. Susan Engel is a frequent scene-stealer as an acidly funny blue stocking Florence Boorman, more intelligent than probably anyone else around and utterly devoted to the cause. Adam Rawlins does extremely well as the husband put aside by Celia with a sympathetic portrayal showing that it wasn’t just women who were the victims, there were men and children affected by their actions too. It is effectively staged with Rob Howell’s design, the cells being the most striking image, played off with the dullness of the potato peeling they have to do and the sheer horror of the force-feeding scene which is truly harrowing and difficult to watch. The projection of film and images of real suffragettes like Emily Wilding Davison adds a real poignancy to the production and serves as a reminder that whilst these are fictional characters, their struggle was all too painfully real."
257,257,Ought To Be Clowns,13/12/2011,Ian,Noises Off, Old Vic,"Sondheim once posed the question “Don’t you love farce?” which given the name of this blog is rather apt for me, and I can safely say that it is not a genre of which I have proven fond. I’ve given it several tries but I really wasn’t a fan at all of A Flea In Her Ear, Once Bitten or One Man Two Guvnors, though the Orange Tree’s Three Farces did hint at the possibilities within the form that I did actually find funny. Billington reckoned in his last review of One Man Two Guvnors that one “would had to have had a humour by-pass not to enjoy it” which seems a bit harsh – I’m not against people finding farce funny but senses of humour are individual and so different things make different people laugh. So you’d be quite right to think there was little chance of me going to see Michael Frayn’s Noises Off, the Old Vic having apparently decided that farce is their Christmas go-to. But I’m a theatre addict, and I love Celia Imrie, so I plonked down £20 for a restricted view seat (which happened to have several empty seats next to it, which I would never recommend that you could sneakily upgrade yourself to…) and gritted my teeth in readiness. Frayn’s play, directed here by Lindsay Posner, follows the experience of a touring theatre company who are taking on a play, a farce called Nothing On, and we visit them three times: firstly at their final dress rehearsal, secondly at a matinée performance somewhere in the run and then lastly at one of the final performances. Each act contains a run-through of the first act of the play within the play and through this, we see the subtle (and not so subtle) variations in the versions as the personal relationships amongst the cast deteriorate spectacularly, leading to increasing chaos both offstage and on. Dear reader, something happened to me. I did find the first half a little slow-going; it doesn’t help that my default position is to detest all those around me who start braying with laughter from the first word and it is often hard to recover from that sense of alienation. So the first act raised some chuckles, especially with Robert Glenister’s frustrated director yelling his cues and notes from the stalls and the frequent breaks from character that the actors made as the rehearsal grinds slowly to a halt. And as the first time we see the ‘farce’, my heart sank a little as it checked all the boxes of farcical comedy, the things that I’m not a fan of as doors are slammed, trousers fall down and plates of sardines are whooshed around. But then the second act started and it is an absolute masterstroke. We rejoin the tour (the blurb says on the first night, Wikipedia says a month later, Frayn says he’s rewritten it several times, so who knows – maybe I should have bought a programme!) but this time we see the play from backstage and it is hilarious. Just seeing the mechanics of how a play like this would work backstage is clever enough, but overlaid on top of that is the increasingly strained atmosphere as lovers fall out, love triangles are exposed and petty squabbles erupt at the simplest of things. This is all done in near-silence as the play is going on at the same time and it is a work of genius. Jamie Glover comes into his own here with a brilliant physical performance as the increasingly angry Garry who finds himself tied in knots. The final act then plays out back the normal way round, but the company are so tired, both physically and of the play itself, that the shenanigans have gotten even worse and the play literally falls apart onstage to uproarious effect as some actors carry blindly on, others try to improvise their way out of it and some just don’t give a damn any more. Janie Dee’s ever-resourceful Belinda, excellent throughout, particularly shines here as the one determined to make the show carry on and Amy Nuttall is also good as the dippy Brooke, unable to deal with any change and sticking blindly to the script even as the play falls apart around her. Posner has drilled his cast extremely well and in this last preview, I’d wager most if not all of multitude of comic hits were delivered perfectly. Celia Imrie is fantastic as the slightly up-herself actress playing the dim housekeeper (the inspiration for Acorn Antique’s Mrs Overall perhaps…?), Jonathan Coy and Karl Johnson also do well as a wet blanket and a drunk respectively and Paul Ready makes the most of a small part as the stage manager (though for some reason, this feels like an odd choice for him). As in often the case, if one goes into a play with low expectations, it is easier to end up having a good time. But Noises Off is more than that I think, this is an intelligent comedy that does more than just repeat the same joke ad nauseam to get the laughs, and so becomes genuinely funny – especially when delivered by such a quality cast and creative team as it is here. In the end though, we all have different senses of humour and so everything I say is in relation to what makes me laugh, but I’d say this is destined to be one of the funniest things in London this winter. It's a cracking script, isn't it?  I'm impressed that you remained impassive when presented with One Man, Two Guvnors – but succumbed to this. My preference was t'other way around!"
258,258,Ought To Be Clowns,10/10/2010,Ian,Flashdance – The Musical, Shaftesbury,"I was originally meant to see Flashdance -The Musical at the Shaftesbury Theatre a couple of weeks ago but that first preview was cancelled due to technical difficulties, so when I finally made it to one of the last previews, my heart sank as we waited for the curtain to rise and the announcement came that the start of the afternoon’s show was being delayed due to, you’ve guessed it, technical difficulties! Having been outraged at the merchandising in the foyer (£60 for a special Barbie! £15 for a pair of legwarmers!) I was thus prepared with sharpened knives for what was coming my way. Perhaps my lowered expectations had something to do with then, but I ended up having quite a good time! Based on the Paramount Pictures film, Flashdance – The Musical has a book by Tom Hedley & Robert Cary, music by Robbie Roth and lyrics by Robbie Roth and Robert Cary, but also features choreography from Arlene Phillips (who really does belong back on our screens at the weekend). Set in Pittsburgh in the 1980s, we meet Alex, apprentice steel welder by day, club dancer by night (who isn’t!) who dreams of love and life in dance school. Watching this reminded me of just how many times I have seen variations of this story played out in countless films, of someone fighting against the odds to, delete as appropriate, date a black guy/rise above working class roots/honour a dead relative/not be a stripper and get to the audition in time to wipe the smile off that smug auditioner’s face in order to secure a place at an amazing dance school for which they are eminently unsuitable. But I love each and every one of them, there’s nothing like a cheesy teen dance film to raise the spirits! And as Flashdance got in there at the beginning, it can consider itself mistress of the genre. It was all rather good fun: it is clearly a film set in the 80s, there’s personal stereos, day-glo everywhere and a giant mobile phone but there’s also a very modern sensibility to it with street-dancing being incorporated into the very fabric of the show. I’m not sure how authentically 80s this is, but it doesn’t really matter as it infuses a huge energy into the production and one which doesn’t relent until the curtain comes down. It’s very much a play of the film, but there have been some quite significant changes: the roles of Alex’s friends have been significantly beefed up and there’s no ice skating disappointingly, Alex’s mentor figure is replaced by her mother and the drug dealing element were the ones that stuck out to me, but there’s quite a few more too but they all seem to fit well into the retooled story. There’s five songs (at least as I remember) from the original film and all the other songs are originals, written especially for this show and by and large they are mostly efficient, if not hugely memorable when up against tunes like ‘Maniac’, ‘Gloria’, ‘I Love Rock’n’Roll’ and the title track. Victoria Hamilton-Barritt as the ever-wise-cracking Alex is rarely off the stage and manages very well: vocally very secure, confident with her dancing and does her best with the utter cheesefest that is the vast majority of her dialogue. There was one point where my heart went out to her as she was getting dressed whilst singing, she struggled to zip up her shorts, fasten her belt, get her boots on the right feet and then get her arms into the sleeves of her leather jacket, who hasn’t had mornings like that but at least we don’t have a theatre full of people watching our every move. This is something that needs to be worked on! The delightfully monikered Twinnie Lee Moore as Jazmin is superb, her dancing was just excellent and she really seemed to be enjoying herself and vocally with Hannah Levane as Keisha delivered songs with a fierce vivacity which lit up the stage, their songs were probably the highlight of the show for me. Charlotte Harwood as Gloria the third member of this little group had a more difficult job with a bit of an uncertain character that didn’t fit too easily with the other two diva dancers and I felt a little too much hesitancy in her delivery throughout. Sarah Ingram’s mother is good but I found Matt Willis solid rather than amazing and is lumbered with a most random sequence where having been forced to fire people from t’mill, he then launches straight into a song with a gay disco beat, somewhat incongruous to say the least. The dance company seem well-drilled, many are given the opportunity to showcase their own styles too, most notably Robbie White, the contemporary dancer who made a huge splash on So You Think You Can Dance and probably would have won it had he not dislocated his shoulder. Director Nikolai Foster clearly has a great eye for putting together the big sequences: the group dance routines are well mounted and I really loved the montages, especially the fast-forwarding through Alex and Nick’s first few dates, from the cinema to ballet to dinner which was so smoothly done despite incorporating so many elements. Visually it looked good with striking images like the silhouetted figures at the start of ‘Maniac’ impressing, but it was disappointing to see the iconic fall of water on Alex in her chair and subsequent hair flick (the image used to sell the play no less) getting about 0.5 seconds before the lights were cut at the end of Act 1. But there’s also a slight sense of overkill with just how a fair amount of street dance is incorporated in a poorly integrated way: it is one thing to play to the strengths of your company but the use of little street-dance interludes in the scene changes was used too infrequently to be really effective. When the opening dancer who appears when the lights are still up, it is a nice touch and gets the audience hooked in but then he just disappears whilst the overture continues (presumably to take his place for the first number) and there’s an awkward moment until eventually the show starts. Likewise, the famous audition routine to the title song is somewhat taken over by the introduction of the dancers in the middle, ruining the drama of the moment, as they then have to go off stage whilst she gets the nod from the dance school teacher and then play the final scene. It is an energetic routine but would be better suited in the finale rather than as part of the actual show. Having seen the set and the way it is staged, I am more inclined to be forgiving about the technical difficulties: it is quite a complex set with a large series of panels and backdrops and sets sliding in from all angles at repeated intervals and it all looks most impressive. Quite why they then decided to add in projections at random moments I do not know. Whether it was an animated version of Alex, abstract blobs of colours or a live video effect during one of the dance sequences, it just felt like a completely unnecessary and superfluous addition to the whole. And whilst I’m moaning, I’d get rid of the bicycle from the opening scene; I wasn’t keen on the way in which the track around the orchestra pit was constantly used, but to little effect: one scene had characters just going round in circles on it doing nothing. I am aware that I have waffled on for ages here, but that is because I do believe there is a great show in the making here. There are still a few teething problems which can be sorted out by opening night and the cast need a little time to get to grips with the considerable changes that have apparently been happening over the last two weeks, but give them time and I think they’ll get there. My main note of advice would be that the cast need to learn to keep their game faces on: whether it was the aforementioned difficulties with getting dressed, head mikes coming loose, baseball caps falling off or sheets getting stuck to belts, too much attention was brought to them, faffing around or giggling, instead of focusing on just getting the job done. It’s easy for me to say, but at these ticket prices (even in the preview period), a certain professionalism should be a given."
259,259,Ought To Be Clowns,24/04/2019,Ian,Twelfth Night, Rose Playhouse,"OVO Theatre were responsible for my first visit to St Albans with last year’s Much Ado About Nothing in the grand surroundings of the Roman Theatre of Verulamium there. This year, my travel time may have been significantly cut down but once again there’s no less history in their venue choice as their musicalised production of Twelfth Night takes place in the archaeological wonder of Bankside’s Rose Playhouse. And also once again, there’s an intriguing mismatch between said history and the setting for the reinterpreted play. Roman ruins formed the backdrop for a 50s American diner last time around; here, the darkness surrounding Tudor stone suggests endless ocean as we find ourselves on the SS Illyria in all the hedonistic excess of the roaring twenties. A bold move and one which has its moments in Adam Nichols’ production. Trimmed down to a nifty 90 minutes or so and bolstered by a suite of swing-based covers of contemporary pop songs, there’s not much subtlety here as broad strokes are used to cover the story of music hall act ‘Viola and Sebastian The Dancing Twins’ as they are rescued from their own sinking cruise ship. But beauty can be found even in primary colours and there’s much to enjoy in the knockabout comedy (James Douglas’ nice-but-dim Sir Andrew Aguecheek is a particular treat) and some great music (Hannah Francis-Baker’s Feste is a real talent, that Katy Perry number should be front and centre in her cabaret set!). Naturally, some of the bold decisions didn’t quite work for me. In a play so forward-thinking when it comes to gender and a production that happily casts a female Malvolia, Feste and Toby Belch, it’s a bit disappointing that punches are pulled as Maria’s affections are transferred to Fabian in order to keep them heterosexual. And there’s a bit too much of a push to make pretty much the entire company that unlikable (in the vein of the Bright Young Things) in the final moments which feels a touch unbalanced."
260,260,Ought To Be Clowns,24/03/2010,Ian,Macbeth, Cheek by Jowl at the Barbican,"And first a moan. I’d intentionally booked front row seats for this back in December, so upon arrival I was a little surprised to find that there was another row of seats in front of ours, row AA which is set a little closer to the ground but with nowhere near sufficient a rake to prevent people’s heads being seriously in the way. This extra row was added in to sell extra tickets due to it being a sellout and whilst I’m happy for the Barbican with their success here, I’m most annoyed that it subsequently affected my enjoyment of the evening. Cheek by Jowl return to London with their interpretation of Macbeth, Shakespeare’s examination of the cost of chasing power and limitless ambition without responsibility, using their trademark inventiveness to create an otherworldly experience. Setting up in the Silk Street Theatre at the Barbican, there is excellent use of the space throughout the play: the opening haze-filled scene seems to take place in a seemingly endless void, later on the rear wall is used most effectively with spotlights and shadows thrown up. So much is left dark or in shadow, the audience is left to let their imagination fill in the gaps. Nick Ormerod’s design (and indeed Declan Donnellan’s direction) aesthetic seems informed by Antony Gormley: scenes often recall the Another Place installation on Crosby beach, as does the main publicity shot, and even the wooden boxes surrounding the stage evoke images of the dance work Sutra. With Judith Greenwood’s atmospheric lighting, the combined effect is quite stunning, especially given the lack of props. Sound is also deployed to incredible effect, most notably in the Weird Sister scenes, with the company repeating the lines in a menacing whisper as the prophecies are delivered, most chilling and effective. Drums bang, cymbals clatter, an eerie violin is scratched, sounds emerge from all over the stage. The world created in which to play is so well done that it is hardly surprising that the storytelling doesn’t quite match up. Pared down to just over a couple of hours, everything is necessarily speeded up which does have a bit of a detrimental effect on the portrayal of the lead characters. From the outset, Will Keen’s Macbeth captures the intensity of a man on the edge of madness and Anastasia Hille’s Lady Macbeth was steely strong and coldly ambitious, but then there’s little place else to go with this couple. I felt like there was little attempt to play the nuances of the characters, not that they were bad performances per se, just surprisingly one-note. I ended up being more impressed by the likes of David Caves’ Macduff, and Ryan Kiggell’s Banquo. There was also a smattering of interesting choices like David Collings’ Duncan being blind and Kelly Hotten’s bawdy Glaswegian Porter that kept the audience on their toes, and the rest of the company did strong work in fluidly moving between the minor characters, a faceless chorus, forming scenery, creating sounds, dancing a Scottish country reel…they really do earn their keep here! However, whilst the abbreviated running time is quite welcome, the final quarter of the show loses much of the energy and inventiveness that precedes it and subsequently ended up feeling really quite punishing. Malcolm and Macduff’s conversation about the crown in particular was interminable and the general consensus around me was that it really did need an interval. And whereas the focus was clearly on encouraging the imagination of the audience, the amount of miming on show, dangerously close to being over-egged at times, did feel a little too much. There are elements of this Macbeth that soared, in the staging and the evocation of a menacing atmosphere in which the supernatural can take hold and one is never quite sure what will come next. But in paring back so much, I fear that too many layers and subtleties have been lost to make this a truly great production. Oh and I almost forgot, this was the first time I've seen a Prince Albert, or rather a reference to one, in a Shakespeare play… This was the gayest Macbeth ever, all that homoerotic clutching!!"
261,261,Ought To Be Clowns,23/11/2014,Ian,Assassins, Menier Chocolate Factory,"The season to be jolly is fast approaching but if the idea of Christmas cheer in the theatre leaves you, well, less than cheerful, then the Menier Chocolate Factory’s festive offering this year may well be up your street. The highly prolific director Jamie Lloyd is taking on Stephen Sondheim’s Assassins, which sees Sondheim’s music and lyrics coiled around John Weidman’s book exploring the men and women who tried (whether successfully or not) to assassinate a President of the United States. It’s hardly the most Christmassy of shows and I think that is pretty much the point. And Sondheim’s enduring popularity (especially at this venue) makes it a safe bet even before the luxurious quality of the cast and company comes into the equation. I saw the first preview on Friday, my booking radar having gone a little awry as I was away when the tickets were released, so instead of reviewing the production, I’m offering you 10 things to look forward to and look out for and if I get to see the show later in the run, I’ll review it ‘properly’ then. Here be mild production spoilers (all hidden behind links). "
262,262,Ought To Be Clowns,18/01/2014,Ian,The Pass, Royal Court,"Football is a game of two halves, The Pass is a play of two halves and between the words and the images, this review definitely made up of two halves. Set in the high-stakes world of celebrity football, John Donnelly’s play spreads over three scenes set over twelve years, starting with young bucks Jason and Ade on the cusp of making their first team debuts in a Champions League dead rubber in Bulgaria. But in their shared hotel room the night before, it seems like they might be interested in sharing more than just tactics. But though homosexuality in football may be the headline grabber, especially in these post-Hitzlsperger times, Donnelly is just as interested in exploring the corrosive effects that accompanies the leap into superstardom for the lucky few. As the play jumps forward seven years, and then another five, we see Jason’s career goes stratospheric whilst Ade’s languishes, but professional success comes at personal cost – especially in the strait-laced world of the beautiful game – as we see just how far Jason is willing to go to protect his position. "
263,263,Ought To Be Clowns,11/11/2018,Ian,Brass the Musical, Mountview at the Bernie Grant Arts Centre,"It’s not often that you get the chance to compare and contrast two contemporaneous productions of the same musical but that is exactly what you can do right now with Brass the Musical. Sasha Regan at The Union Theatre opened her version this week (review here) and now a group of Mountview students are having a crack at it at the Bernie Grant Arts Centre. I was particularly tempted to return to the show as the show’s writer Benjamin Till – an alumnus of Mountview himself – is also on directorial duties. It was fascinating to see the show for the second time in a week as the approaches by each director offered up intriguingly different interpretations. Till clearly benefits from the resources of one of the UK’s leading drama schools and so is able to conscript a band to meet the demands of his brass-heavy score, fill his stage with bodies and get them to execute some pretty nifty choreography (by Simon Hardwick). The contrast is huge with the Union, where studied intimacy is the watchword even though the company is only fractionally smaller.   The major difference comes with the music and it is amazing how well it works in both versions. The quartet of Mountview brass players sound gorgeous as stirring melodies strike out and elegiac motifs recur, a constant reminder of the brass band that is so crucial to this community. But where Henry Brennan’s solo piano at the Union pares some of that back, the introduction of trumpets at a few crucial moments is heartbreakingly beautiful, a poignant reminder of what that community has lost. Both equally valid, both bringing tears to my eyes I also enjoyed seeing alternatives takes on characters that had been so vividly realised for me so recently. Holly Maguire’s superbly assured Peggy suggests a strong comedic future in the making, Elliot Moore and Jamie Jonathan’s pairing on the plaintive ‘I Miss The Music’ was just delicious, Eleanor Reynolds tempered Tats’ innate anger adroitly and Daniel George brought a lovely warmth to the genial Brummie Wilf. And much as I like to say I don’t pick favourites, I couldn’t help but be wowed by Stephanie Callow as the tragic Emmie – by God, she makes you feel…"
264,264,Ought To Be Clowns,08/10/2015,mag9l,Measure for Measure, Young Vic,"They say things come in threes and as with Oresteias, so too with Measure for Measures. After Cheek by Jowl’s brutally contemporary Russian interpretation and Dominic Dromgoole’s comic version for the Globe, it is now Joe Hill-Gibbins’ turn to put his inimitable stamp on the play for the Young Vic. And from the industrial techno rave that opens the show to the awkward freeze-frame of the Duke’s happy ending – all done in a smidge under two hours – this is very much a modern take on Shakespeare that is bound to ruffle certain feathers whilst stimulating others. With the licentiousness of Viennese society being represented by scores of inflatable sex toy dolls, the image of which recur throughout this whole production, and the Duke using live video relays to speak to the city, the modern-day feel is overt but non-specific, the point being we could be in any major city where a conservative regime is free to impose its puritanical fervour. And in this mise-en-scène, curated by dramaturg Zoë Svendsen and artfully framed in Miriam Buether’s box-frame set with hidden rear compartment, the story unfolds. Given the abbreviated running time, this is definitely Measure redux and so sometimes the clarity of the storytelling isn’t always there, especially in the subplots. The excellent Paul Ready’s ruling deputy Angelo is thrown a major curveball when his strictness is challenged by novice Isabella, a resplendent Romola Garai, the sexuality she awakens in him obvious from his inability to even stand up straight in the same room as her. He’s sentenced her brother to death, she’s pleaded for mercy but he’ll only concede if she surrenders her chastity to him, the blow-up dolls clearly not doing enough. Watching from the sidelines is Zubin Varla’s Duke, who left Angelo in charge and has also been captivated by Isabella. Varla makes him quite the energetic but enigmatic figure, in keeping with the non-committal production at large and whilst this does leave a lot of room for audiences to make up their own mind about this version of this ‘problem play’, it can at times feel a little ephemeral. Key relationships don’t resonate quite as strongly as they should (Isabella and her brother for example) and some scenes can feel hurried (for me, the final scene needed more haste less speed). But there’s huge amounts to enjoy too, from this most inventive of directors. The use of video (Chris Kondek) is inspired, especially when soliloquising, James Farncombe’s lighting has an extraordinary conjuring effect and Hill-Gibbins’ eye for arresting details is spot-on – the imagery of Isabella’s isolated worship becomes a thing of beauty, Mariana’s abandoned prostrate body explodes into life in a most arresting manner, Sarah Malin’s gender-swapped Escalus is a small but significant point, even a beheaded head in a bag – the downfall of many a director – gets an irreverently funny touch."
265,265,Ought To Be Clowns,24/04/2016,mag9l,Kings of War, Toneelgroep Amsterdam at the Barbican,"It’s well over six years now since Toneelgroep Amsterdam blew open my tiny little mind with their Roman Tragedies. Back at a time when this blog was in its infancy, back when I ‘only’ saw something like 10 shows a month, back when making the decision to see a six-hour-long Shakespearean epic in Dutch was something surprising. Nowadays of course it is second nature, I regularly visit Amsterdam to see this extraordinary company work and I’ve been to New York to see director Ivo van Hove cast his magic on Broadway too in The Crucible. But it is nice to only have to go to the Barbican to see them too and at just the four and a half hours, Kings of War is practically an amuse-bouche! My spoiler-free review from Amsterdam is here but so much more resonated with me second time around, so we’re going deeper here folks. As with the significantly worthier The Wars of the Roses (more than twice as long in toto, less than half as good), the impetus for the storytelling comes from merging Shakespeare’s first history cycle, only van Hove goes one further and includes Henry V (and arguably a smidgen of Henry IV Part 2 too). So the overarching narrative becomes one of power – the violence of seizing it, the realities of maintaining it, the struggle to keep it – as played out over and over again in this vicious cycle of dynastic tussles.  And this it shows by honing in the focus entirely on the kings, and those that would be kings, and the world they live in. So Jan Verweysweld’s set encloses them in a palatial estate, a vast room that gradually evolves from war room to decadent largesse to haunting bunker, keeping the rulers in but equally important, keeping the outside world out. For Bart Van den Eynde and Peter Van Kraaij’s free adaptation excises as well as distils, this controlled perspective meaning its not necessarily Shakespeare as we – as in British audiences – might know it and for the better it is too. It’s a fantastically pacy evening and for all its familiarity, full of surprises. The warren of clinically white corridors behind the main chamber allows for live and prerecorded video (Tal Yarden) to be seamlessly intercut, often revealing the consequences of the dirty business of ruling. Eric Sleichim’s music mixes the arresting brass ensemble BL!NDMAN, Steve Dugardin’s stunning countertenor solos and a fine besuited DJ to highly atmospheric effect. And an attention to even the smallest of details that are a constant delight to behold, alongside the main action – the array of films playing in Henry V’s war office, the way that Eelco Smit’s Henry VI folds his pyjamas under the pillow, Richard III keeping his deadly syringes in the same cabinet as the crown.  It helps to that Toneelgroep Amsterdam’s long-established company of actors remain in such fine form. Ramsey Nasr’s Henry V shows us pragmatic leadership and a brilliantly shouty flirting style; Smits is perfect as an ineffectually nerdish Henry VI, sobbing at the pressure of monarchy from the moment he’s crowned; and Hans Kesting astonishingly memorable as Mark Antony once again astounds as a chillingly psychopathic Richard III. Whether dodging (brilliantly realised) ghosts, charging around the stage terrifyingly playing make-believe, or soliloquising into a full-length mirror, his mesmerising malevolence holds us rapt for the entirety of the second act. There’s brilliant work too from Chris Nietvelt as a deeply human Montjoy, a fervent Eleanor of Gloucester and a startling Elizabeth of York who shares a memorably intense scene with Kesting whilst trying to defend her daughter; from Bart Sleger’s coldly calculating York, his elegant poise shattered by a brutal incident that brings the curtain down on Act 1 with hairs on end; from an aged-up Marieke Heebink as an embittered but still empathetic Duchess of York, Hélène Devos’ scarcely-won-over Princess Katherine, Aus Greidanus Jr’s dessert-munching Buckingham; from everyone really. "
266,266,Ought To Be Clowns,17/07/2012,Ian,Vieux Carré, King’s Head,"Though some of Tennessee Williams’ works are considered amongst the finest plays ever written, his legacy as a truly great playwright is something that has developed posthumously. He continued to produce considerable amounts of writing until the day that he died in 1983 but its critical reception was increasingly poor and so much of the latter part of his body of work has remained neglected. His 1977 play Vieux Carré hasn’t been seen in London since 1978 (although part of it formed part of another Williams play I Never Get Dressed Till After Dark On Sundays which played at the Cock Tavern as part of a double bill of unperformed works) but now receives a rare revival at the King’s Head Theatre in north London. Often, the delving into the little-performed parts of established playwrights’ back catalogues reveals a good reason as to why they have largely on the shelves, but Robert Chevara’s production shimmers with Southern heat and captivating character work to make this a rediscovery worth taking considerable note of. Nicolai Hart Hansen’s set design wisely strips things back to distressed brick walls, maximising the space available into which three beds, a dinner table and a throw-covered grand piano are squeezed to evoke the rooming house of Mrs Wire, on 722 Toulouse in the French Quarter of New Orleans. We start with the figure of The Writer recalling the time he spent there and switch back in time to see him as a callow young man, newly arrived from St Louis and nervously struggling with his unfamiliar surroundings. As The Writer slowly makes the acquaintance of his varied fellow residents and comes to terms with the reality of his own impoverished circumstances, Williams weaves together suggestions of all the lives contained within to create a moving tableau of human frailty and the loneliness that can come even when living in shared accommodation in a bustling city. From the ravenous, birdlike figures of Miss Carrie and Mary Maude (Hildegard Neil and Anna Kirke in beautifully affecting form) proudly trying to disguise their scavenging, to the troubled relationship between the forthright Jane and her no-good hunk of beefcake of a boyfriend Tye (Samantha Coughlan and Paul Standell connecting physically most effectively). From the long suffering and soon-to-retire Nursie (Eva Fontaine) to the lecherous, lascivious but not long for this world artist Nightingale (David Whitworth relishing the bitingly acerbic wit). The Writer’s surroundings slowly inspire him to creative and personal awakenings and the realisation that this is but just another stop on the journey ahead, rather than the destination."
267,267,Ought To Be Clowns,19/09/2018,Ian,The King and I, Palladium,"Despite my love of a classic musical, it has taken me a wee while to work up the enthusiasm to go and see The King and I at the Palladium. A big Broadway success, Bartlett Sher’s production kept its leads of Kelli O’Hara and Ken Watanabe but with that pedigree comes an element of playing it safe, which is what I think has kept me at bay. And in watching the show, you can’t ever really escape this feeling of sedateness, splendidly mounted as it is. Catherine Zuber’s costume work is beyond lush, Michael Yeargan’s set has an epic scale and the sweep of Christopher Gattelli’s take on Jerome Robbins’ original choreography is quite often breathtaking – they don’t make em like this any more etc etc.  The epithet also applies to the writing though, Rodgers & Hammerstein’s formal daring from the 1950s doesn’t quite transplant to the 2010s without a sense of awkwardness. Work has been done to redress the balance of the time period from whence it came with contemporary attitudes and you feel it in elements like Lady Thiang’s beefed-up role, and the switch away from colonialism to cultural awareness. And it is all carried off with a huge deal of professional sheen. O’Hara sounds like a dream, Watanabe is full of character, and Na-Young Jeon and Ruthie Ann Miles both impress. The familiarity of the score swings you through the near three hours without hardly a lull and Stephen Ridley’s musical direction makes it sound so very lush. For all this though, The King and I – in this shape – does feel perilously close to a museum piece, albeit a hugely attractive one."
268,268,Ought To Be Clowns,18/02/2019,Ian,I Want You To Admire Me/But You Shouldn’t, VAULT Festival,"David Attenborough or Michelle Obama? Magic or science? Going along with the majority or sticking to your own guns? The interactive element of I Want You To Admire Me/But You Shouldn’t requires some fun decision-making but also offers up something interesting about the psychology of audiences when confronted with even the most harmless of choices. Dirty Rascals’ I Want You To… takes the form of your archetypal TV game show from an era gone by, as three contestants compete for the accolade of Most Admirable Person. But the contest proves far from benign as the desire to win corrodes into a desperation to be approved, laying bare the ultimate hollowness of seeking such approval from others.  So it’s all fun and games until it isn’t, and Tom Macqueen’s TV host channels any number of mighty forbears – Jim Bowen’s geniality, Bruce Forsyth’s openness, Chris Tarrant’s empty sardonic tone… And as he’s a consistent presence as the tone slips and shifts, moving from awarding ‘moments of admiration’ to genuinely disturbing ‘moments of shame’."
269,269,Ought To Be Clowns,31/08/2019,Ian,De Kersentuin, Stadschouwberg Amsterdam,"It’s not often that Jimi Hendrix and Creedence Clearwater Revival make their way into Chekhov but it is precisely this kind of refreshing approach that makes this production feel so alive in a way that is rarely achieved (in the UK at least). So it is somewhat perverse that it is a British director responsible, as Simon McBurney directs Internationaal Theater Amsterdam in De Kersentuin, in an adaptation by Robert Icke. Shifted to the Netherlands in the 1970s, a real sense of liberation permeates the production, and crucial details shine anew to substantively alter the emotional palette. I’ve never felt the presence of Amanda’s drowned son so strongly, which really makes you consider her feelings towards her former home. And as Miriam Buether’s design discards conventional representation, the focus falls as much on the relations of people as it does on property.  Chris Nietvelt’s Amanda (Ranevskaya) and Gijs Scholten van Aschat’s Steven (Lopakhin) are both fantastic as the central figures, respectively embodying old and new orders and the distance that necessarily must lie between them. Nietvelt is heartbreaking as a woman too smart to let self-delusion take over entirely and Scholten van Aschat’s energy as a man who needs to keep himself busy makes him a most charismatic figure."
270,270,Ought To Be Clowns,08/10/2014,Ian,The Edge of our Bodies, Gate,
271,271,Ought To Be Clowns,15/04/2014,mag9l,Birdland, Royal Court,"It was Scarlett Johansson wot did it. My over-riding thought as Simon Stephens’ Birdland built to its destructive climax was that the alien for Jonathan Glazer’s recent film Under The Skin had somehow infiltrated affairs. The viscous black liquid that surrounds Ian MacNeil’s set slowly rises to encroach on the ever-twisted world of tortured rockstar Paul, threatening to swallow him in its total embrace, an oblivion the man might truly welcome. But it is just a coincidence, although perhaps rooted in some conceptual similarity, there are no aliens here. Or Hollywood superstars. Instead, Irish legend-in-the-making Andrew Scott plays a hugely successful musician who is on top of the world and coming to the end of going round the world on a huge tour. Whipped into a constant fervour by the corrosive side of celebrity, his personality has become so warped that he can, and does, demand anything he wants, and by and large gets it. Aside from making him a total f*cktard, especially where his best friend and bandmate’s girlfriend is concerned, it also symptomizes the deeper societal malaise of a corrupted capitalist mindset in all its exploitative ugliness. Director Carrie Cracknell employs an exciting visual language in this Royal Court production, pushing at notional ideas of representation through MacNeil’s almost gnomic design. A golden arch that slides back and forth across the stage, plastic wheelie chairs that remain onstage throughout, reels of vibrant orange police tape, the aforementioned black water that surrounds them all – Cracknell cleverly manages to suggest a hugely interpretative approach to the text but it is one which never alienates through its strangeness, never pushes its audience too far in search of dramatic thrill – it is still Sloane Square after all.  But for all her efforts, Stephens’ play doesn’t quite have the tautness one might have expected. The career-threatening spike of revenge feels lazily plotted, a further late twist assumes an incredulous amount of naïveté from someone several albums and two world tours deep into his career, the larger themes of the writing never really kick as hard as they could. Instead, the real joy comes from little moments – the hilarious chat of the hospitality suite “it felt like you were really there”, the heartbreaking meeting with Paul’s father “[your album got] four stars in the Chronicle and Echo”."
272,272,Ought To Be Clowns,25/10/2013,Ian,A Doll’s House, Duke of York’s,"Not a huge amount to say about a return visit to this excellent Ibsen adaptation which I first saw back in July last year – since then, A Doll’s House has won multiple awards, mainly for its leading star Hattie Morahan, returned to the Young Vic for a repeat run, moved into the West End for a further extension and announced a transfer to Broadway, not a bad piece of work really. I loved it first time round, against all expectations, and wasn’t intending to revisit but the canny pricing of the transfer meant tickets in the front rows were a bargainous £10 and so I booked for the end of the London run."
273,273,Ought To Be Clowns,28/10/2011,Ian,Death and the Maiden, Harold Pinter,"Ariel Dorfman’s play 1990 Death and the Maiden is set in an unspecified country in which a military dictatorship has just fallen: as a Chilean citizen, it is not hard to see where the inspiration might have come from. This tale is of a former political prisoner who unexpectedly encounters a man, who happens to have given her husband a lift home, who she comes to believe was one of the hooded men who tortured her in her captivity. She then turns the table, taking him captive and puts him on (mock) trial to elicit the confession she needs in order to move on with her life though her husband, a lawyer who is part of the Commission dealing with the legacy of the repressive regime, has his doubts. Jeremy Herrin’s production is notable for marking the first stage role for Thandie Newton, an actress best know for her film work (and also for making ER unwatchable for a couple of series, poor Dr Carter…) One could sugar-coat the comments and talk about the fact that it is her theatrical debut and so perhaps a little leniency is in order, but we’re past press night and as a paying customer I have to say I was disappointed. Newton doesn’t seem to have the language to fully portray the profundity of her character here: not physically, as in the unconvincing opening scene where she just doesn’t come across as haunted enough nor emotionally, she just exudes too much composure even whilst ostensibly unravelling and so never convinces at showing the depth of the psychological damage that drives Paulina to her extreme actions. In some ways, matters are exacerbated by the strength of her co-stars. Tom Goodman-Hill demonstrates great subtlety in his performance as her husband Gerardo, a caring liberal lawyer torn between doing what he feels is right and his (inexplicably) deep love for his wife, shading in frustrations both from past and present that make him fascinating to watch. Anthony Calf is also excellent at muddying the water with his character, leaving a real sense of ambiguity as to just how innocent or guilty he might be. For me there was also the sense that the play hasn’t necessarily aged that well especially as events have overtaken it a little. Whether it is the new generation of Chilean writers who are tackling their country’s troubled history head on or the very real drama that is coming from the ongoing impact of the events of the Arab Spring, Dorfman’s writing didn’t hit me with the urgency that I wanted, though it is often clever in the way in which it shifts our sympathies from person to person, throwing shadows of doubt on even the most resolute of positions. So a rather inauspicious beginning for the newly-renamed Harold Pinter Theatre with something of a mis-step. Matters aren’t helped by several reviewers harking on about how amazing Juliet Stevenson was in the original production at the Royal Court upstairs – and I can well imagine how her intensity in that intimate space would have worked wonders for the show – but even from the perspective of someone who did not see that production, I would be hard-pressed to recommend this to you."
274,274,Ought To Be Clowns,23/09/2011,Ian,When Did You Last See My Mother, Trafalgar Studios 2,"There are two ways this review could go and since I ticked the ‘fanboy going overboard’ box with a mildly amusing drunken encounter (which rebounded on me in the most unexpected way – actors read this thing?!) at the Hampstead Theatre 2 Fridays ago, I shall try to use a more measured approach here. But the uninitiated should know that I do have a slight admiration for the work of Sam Swainsbury… 😉 Anyhoo, to the matter in hand. When Did You Last See My Mother was the first play that Christopher Hampton ever wrote as a teenager in 1964, but despite his reputation has remained rather unknown. And it is a little hard to believe as whilst it may not be the most sophisticated piece of theatre with an ending which whilst sweet is a little too neat, it contains a masterful piece of character work with main protagonist Ian that is a gift of a role for a talented young actor. Director Blanche McIntyre has chosen wisely in casting Harry Melling, perhaps the one of the kids from of the Harry Potter who has shown the most promise as an actor, on the stage at least, and he delivers an extraordinary performance. Set in the bedsit that he shares with Jimmy, Ian is a highly intelligent 18 year old bouncing off the walls with razor-sharp wit, astute observations and a finger-wagging knowingness. But this is partnered with an emotional immaturity in the form of his unresolved but burgeoning sexuality, personified in an all-encompassing crush on Jimmy, himself an attractive young gentleman of sexual fluidity. Matters are further complicated when Jimmy’s attractive mother comes to visit, seeking respite from her domestic issues, and Ian senses an opportunity to get closer to the object of his desire but in a terribly twisted way and with dire consequences. Melling really is superb as Ian, a bundle of awkward nervous energy, flitting from mood to mood in the blink of an eye, cutting others sharp with remarks one moment and then turning the barbs on himself with terrible self-loathing. But we never forget he is still an 18 year old boy, not completely past redemption yet as there still remains a humanity to the character that peeks through: in some respects, he reminded me of a baby Butley, before the bitterness had fully taken hold. Sam Swainsbury felt like perfect casting as Jack-the-lad Jimmy, much more at ease in the world that Ian finds so challenging and Abigail Cruttenden finds a quietly touching dignity as his mother, torn between the two worlds of opportunity and duty."
275,275,Ought To Be Clowns,12/12/2016,mag9l,Hedda Gabler, National Theatre,"With Hedda Gabler, the ever prolific Ivo van Hove is making his National Theatre debut, so you can forgive him returning to a production which he has launched twice before – with the exceptional Dutch actress Halina Reijn in Amsterdam and with Elizabeth Marvel in New York. This time however, he’s working with a new version of Ibsen’s play by Patrick Marber and has the equally extraordinary talents of Ruth Wilson leading his company. And as with his revelatory A View From The Bridge, this is a contemporary reworking of a classic that will frustrate some with its froideur but left me gasping at its gut-wrenching rawness. As ever, van Hove’s spatial intelligence lends itself to a re-appreciation of the theatrical space in which he’s working. He’s invited audiences onstage at the Barbican, and backstage too and here in the Lyttelton, the wings are closed off by Jan Versweyveld’s gallery-like white box and so characters make their entrances and exits through the same doors that we use – Judge Brack even arrives via the rear stalls at one point. And van Hove keeps things off-kilter onstage too, often pushing the action out to the far edges, focusing the eye on unexpected details like the eloquent sweep of Hedda’s back, the tapping foot of a nervy ever-watching Berthe. Marber’s lightly modernised new version allows for dark flashes of humour but there’s no mistaking how lonely and sad this Hedda is, even more so for being so isolated in this modern-day setting. Finding herself trapped in the world of the idle rich, having decided “it was time to settle”, she soon finds herself appalled at her situation. Initially, Wilson blurs the line between malice and thoughtlessness in the extremes of her behaviour but we’re soon left in no doubt that we’re in the hands of as expert a manipulator as Alice Morgan, albeit with less self-control, hints of fragility and frustration are never far away as she rages against a world she sees as determined to strip her of her power, her individuality, the sanctity of her own body as the repeated notes about children and child-bearing make plain.  And the care with which that world has been (re)constructed makes fresh new dramatic sense. Kyle Soller’s Tesman is refreshingly decent, Kate Duchêne’s Aunt Juliana perfectly obliging, Sinéad Matthews’ Mrs Elvsted possessed of a self-confidence we don’t often see in her interactions with Chuk Iwudi’s Lovborg. Against this normality, Hedda’s self-destructive urges are heightened, agonisingly so in the textured lighting design by Versweyveld and musical accompaniment from Joni Mitchell, and as Rafe Spall’s swaggeringly sexual Brack exerts his sickening power inch by inch, the production culminates in a succession of stunning but horrifying images, all correctly disturbing. As brutal a Hedda as you’ll get."
276,276,Ought To Be Clowns,28/06/2018,Ian,Fun Home, Young Vic,"It’s fitting that Fun Home should open in Pride month, not least because it is an all-too-rare show that focuses on the L in LGBT+. But as stirring and gratifying and significant as it is to have a lesbian protagonist, this musical works because it is straight-up fantastic – an unabashedly bold queering of the form that reins back any notion of excess to reveal the simple truth that beneath it all, we all hurt the same.    Fun Home is based on Alison Bechdel’s memoir of the same name, a graphic novel musing on her experiences in coming out and later discovering her father is a closet homosexual, yearning for a deeper understanding about how he could have, maybe, possibly, taken his life while she was still a teenager. Lisa Kron’s book adopts a non-linear approach, using an adult Alison as a narrator to recall fragments of memory from her childhood and from her early university days, the bruising experience of her own life facilitating a deeper reflection.  And it is achingly well done, Sam Gold’s production paring back layers of skin to leave exposed raw nerve, especially in Kaisa Hammarlund’s extraordinary, transformative lead performance. As the oldest Alison, she’s rarely off the stage, often a witness to the scenes playing out before her but she’s such an active listener, complex worlds of emotion playing across her face even in the space of a single song. You need to see the show at least twice just so that you can spend one of them just watching her to get the full richness of the work she’s delivering. It helps that what she is watching is pitch-perfect too. Brooke Haynes’ Small Alison (shared with Harriet Turnbull) is a riot of 70s tomboyish attitude, railing against princess dresses and barrettes, her eyes opened in the most glorious way in the goosebumpingly-good sexuality-owning ‘Ring of Keys’. And there’s subtly excellent work from Eleanor Kane as Medium Alison, full of the awkwardness of being on the edge of coming out and then nearly overwhelmed with the emotional freedom of doing just that (‘Changing My Major’ is a real pleasure) and waiting for the world (ie her parents) to catch up. Zubin Varla (as Katy Perry might say, ‘wig’) captures something infinitely moving in Bruce, the father who in repressing one part of himself, acts out almost in a mania through others. And there’s a welcome return back to the stage for Jenna Russell (really Eastenders, way to waste some talent) as the mother Helen, equally forced to squash down emotion until it explodes in the scorching eloquence of ‘Days and Days’.   Gold’s sure but delicate direction harnesses all of its component parts beautifully. David Zinn’s elegantly executed design allows for shifts from the naturalistic to the liminal, and gives a properly breathtaking moment too. Ben Stanton’s sculptural lighting highlights the emotional stakes and all of the isolation that so many here are feeling. And Nigel Lilley’s musical direction of Jeanine Tesori’s formally challenging score makes strong sense of its fragmentary nature."
277,277,Ought To Be Clowns,15/10/2010,Ian,Billy Elliot The Musical, Victoria Palace,"Trip number three of my musicals extravaganza to Billy Elliot The Musical, a show that for whatever reason, I had no interest in going to and would never have booked for myself had it not been for this deal. I have never actually seen the film and so it was a brand new experience for me in every sense of the word, but it was strangely apt that I saw it on the day after the miners in Chile were rescued which also happened to be Margaret Thatcher’s birthday. The other way in which this show pleased me was with its plot. As it turned out, this is another entry into the traditional dance film/show format of which I am much enamoured and which Flashdance reminded me of recently. With music by Elton John and lyrics and book by Lee Hall, the backdrop this time is the miners’ strike in the mid-1980s up in Country Durham where young Billy makes a journey of personal discovery as he trades his boxing gloves for ballet shoes and attempts to follow his dream of getting into the Royal Ballet School in the face of huge strife in his family and the community around him. No one was more surprised than me at how much I loved this show. It is full of a bright energy but also has real emotional depth: the portrayal of the miners’ strike is well done, making its point without being too heavy-handed, but in the depiction of Billy continuing to miss his mother and finding a substitute in the gruff Mrs Wilkinson, it absolutely melted my heart and I bawled my way through ‘The Letter (Mum’s Letter)’ a devastatingly simple song, without even knowing I was about to cry. I particularly liked the fact that the songs are spread throughout the show, there’s a point about halfway through the second half where you could almost forget we’re in a musical but that is because the story is being told so well and is utterly engaging. Dean Charles Chapman was on as Billy and was simply astounding throughout, in what was a surprisingly demanding role. He has to take us on quite the journey from an uncertain young boy desperately missing his mother to a confident teenager able to see a future for himself as a fledgling top dancer and he does it with such a winning charm it is incredible to think he is only 12. He was vocally strong and had a great rapport with Genevieve Lemon’s superb Mrs Wilkinson as his dance teacher, but it was in his many dancing sequences that he really impressed. There’s so many of them and they are so long and yet each one was delivered with such aplomb whether it was tap with Michael, ballet with his older self or a mix of everything in the Act 1 closer. Peter Darling’s choreography really is the making of this show, managing capture a range of moods and brilliantly weaving together the strands of the show as best shown in Solidarity which mixed a ballet lesson with a confrontation between the police and the miners. The aforementioned uplifting routine to Swan Lake where Billy dances with his older alter-ego (danced by Barnaby Meredith) is spine-tinglingly beautiful and ‘Born To Boogie’ where Mrs Wilkinson and a startlingly limber Mr Braithwaite (the bearish Phil Snowden) come up with a routine for Billy in a sustained comic masterpiece. Joe Massey’s Michael was brilliantly played, nicely comic but sensitively played in his cross-dressing antics and bright-voiced in his singing (though I did find it an odd directorial choice to have the show end on a slow falling curtain on Michael alone) and I also liked Emily Smith as Debbie. But there were no weak links throughout the ensemble which is all the more remarkable considering the possible permutations of the cast with multiples actors playing the three young parts and jaw-dropping to consider that there’s five young boys who can deliver the goods as Billy. So a long time coming for me, but I am so glad that I finally got round to seeing this show and have no hesitation in thoroughly recommending it to everyone, not least to see one of the cutest little roles in the world in Small Boy. Excellent review, Bravo!! However, a few minor points… 1) Your point about Dean’s skills at such a young age is spot on, though his age is actually 13, not 12.2) The normal ending of the show is not the scene where the curtain comes down on Michael after he says goodbye to his best friend, Billy. Though that scene serves as a summation of the plot (boy makes good and escapes from a community/life where his prospects would be dim (like does Michael and most of the rest of the community), the show normally ends with a very uplifting Finale featuring the entire cast led by Billy in a wonderfully upbeat choreographed curtain call.  However, if you saw the show while the theatre was having issues with its new stage floor, the Finale had been temporarily eliminated due to safety issues for the cast.3) There are actually currently (and normally) four boys who play Billy, not five, with each boy normally playing the role twice a week.  Again, if you saw the show in the three week period between September 6 and 25, there was a transition period when there were five Billys, with a new Billy (Scott McKenzie) and one who recently departed from the cast (Ollie Gardner) – but normally there are four. To see Dean Charles’ profile as well as the other three boys currently in the role go here: http://www.theskykid.com/billy-elliot-musical/billy-elliot-the-musical-meet-the-billys-londons-west-end/ I can understand how the reviewer came to the conclusion that Dean was 12-years-old as that is what it says in the programme and was his age when he started in the show as Billy. Thank you for a wonderful review. Thank you for your comments, it's lovely to know that real fans of the show enjoyed my review. I took my information both about Dean's age and the number of Billys from the show's website, but thanks for the corrections. As for the ending, I did get to see the dance finale when I saw the show but I don't think one can count that as an integral part of the drama. I just find it odd that the focus is on Michael in that final scene rather than Billy, but hey ho, it is what it is. I'm already thinking about when I might go again! This comment has been removed by the author. BETM is every bit as much a musical about Michael as it is about its star, Billy. Anyone who can sit through the slowly lowered curtain with Michael's heart breaking as Billy leaves town, possibly forever, and not erupt into a shower of tears is wrapped up too much in male persona, or might be a Klingon. One or the other. Ian, the show you saw (sans the finale) tossed you onto the street in a pensive, thoughtful mood, didn't it? With the finale intact, you leave the theatre wanting to see the show, again, right away, and then another and then another and go the next day and so it goes. The finale is like a narcotic finish to a lovely theatre experience, and just heightens the whole afternoon or evening."
278,278,Ought To Be Clowns,03/03/2017,mag9l,Grounded, Gate,"Grounded ranked in my top five plays of 2013 when it first played the Gate, and I enjoyed it so much that I went back when it came back in 2014. And could I resist one more chance to see Lucy Ellinson’s extraordinary performance in George Brant’s ever-acute one-woman show, could I heck! Directed by Chris Haydon, Grounded cuts deeply into the psychology of outsourcing military decision-making to remote drone pilots, particularly this one soldier who new motherhood calls into question her previously easily gung-ho mentality. Definitely recommended."
279,279,Ought To Be Clowns,11/01/2016,mag9l,Richard III, New Diorama,"It’s nice to see The Faction switching things up a little. Their rep seasons at the New Diorama have considerably brightened up the last few Januaries with Shakespeare, Schiller and more but this year sees them drop the three play model for a single show in Richard III and expand their ensemble to 19 bodies, impressively increasing its diversity in age, colour and gender. The Faction’s playing style is stripped-back and largely prop-free, allowing a focus on physical expression to reinterpret the text. It’s an approach that is suited to the black box of the New Diorama with its blood-red floor mat, Mark Leipacher’s production making varied and visceral use of bodies to form everything from the tower walls that imprison the young princes to the horse Richard rides into battle. And it’s clear that nothing is accidental here, every choice intelligently considered as seen in the bodies that make up the throne to which Gloucester finally accedes, being those of the four men he has most recently had killed. Christopher York (not pictured ;-)) gives us a surprisingly supple and sexy Richard, who plays interestingly with notions of disability and perception. His “foul bunch-backed toad” only ever appears “deformed” when the text explicitly mentions it, the rest of the time York’s Richard appears able-bodied as he well might have considered himself. It’s primarily when others remind him – a vituperative Margaret making him wither with her words, the unthinking cruel humour of a playful nephew – that the reality of his body comes to the fore. Combined with a freshly modern take on the verse, it’s a striking lead performance. But The Faction are an ensemble too and this production showcases that well. A near-spectral Margaret from Sakuntala Ramanee, all whispered incantations and omnipresent menace, and a beautifully modulated Duchess of York from Carmen Munroe (making her Shakespearean debut at 83 no less), raining curses down on her son with real venom. Anna-Maria Nabirye’s Buckingham is a thoughtful reinvention of the character, David Eaton’s murderer introduces a welcome note of dark comedy, reinforced by Lex Kosanke’s sound design."

281,281,Ought To Be Clowns,25/11/2013,Ian,Trout Stanley, Southwark Playhouse,"It’s Sugar & Grace Ducharme’s 30th birthday. But though it’s an auspicious date, it’s also loaded with significance for the pair – their triplet died at birth, they also lost both their parents on the same day and since then, Grace keeps finding a dead body every year. And though they shared a womb, they could not (literally) be more different – Grace’s gregariousness is reflected in her putative local modelling career whereas Sugar hasn’t left their cabin in British Columbia for 10 years. And so begins Trout Stanley.  And that element comes in the form of the eponymous Trout Stanley. A mysterious figure who could be a serial killer and who enjoys sniffing slippers, but who can only tell the truth and who lost his own parents due to an unfortunate incident with a metal detector. His arrival, played with no little intrigue by Dylan Smith, jolts the sisters out of their usual routine and as an all-consuming passion takes over Trout and Sugar, the shift in the balance causes them to question so much that they hold true about their situation and their relationship. This they do through Claudia Dey’s gift for elliptic, almost poetic prose that she has fashioned into a number of monologues that pepper the script, making Matt Steinberg’s production something of a challenge to get into but once attuned, it does pay rewards. The vivid imagery and rhythmic quality of the speech could perhaps have done with a little pruning, just to make it entirely precise, where currently there are moments where it feels close to meandering. But the way in which she builds up the intensity for the final scenes is expertly done, pushing us all close to the edge. Trout Stanley is undoubtedly a quirky piece of theatre – with a name like that, how could it not be – but an unexpected thriller and one well worth the effort and your undivided attention as its hillbilly creepiness winds to a deeply affecting finale. Plus the opportunity to see such a fine actress as Matthews in close proximity should never be passed up, and supported so well by Robinson and Smith, it makes the Southwark Playhouse the new home of Southern (London) Gothic. "
282,282,Ought To Be Clowns,07/05/2011,Ian,The Damnation of Faust, ENO at the Coliseum,"Continuing their sourcing of directors better known in other artistic fields, ENO now feature the operatic directing debut of renowned actor, screenwriter and filmmaker Terry Gilliam with a new production of Berlioz’s The Damnation of Faust. Not strictly speaking an opera, but rather a ‘dramatic legend’ as it was originally composed as a concert score, this has allowed Gilliam’s imagination to run wild but working with his surreal vision is designer Hildegard Bechtler in an unlikely combination. Berlioz’s story is based on Goethe’s original dramatic poem but takes its own route through the story of the lengths a man will go to when tempted by the Devil with promises of youth, knowledge and finally love. The ultimate price paid for Faust’s inability to resist temptation is a most tragic one in this morality tale, which in Gilliam’s major innovation, has been located in Germany, tracing a period from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century and so follows the history and indeed the art of that country. So the backdrop to Faust’s dilemmas are scenes like Bismarck negotiating pre-World War I alliances; bloodied battlefields from the Great War; Brown Shirts drinking in a Weimar bierkeller; Berchtesgaden; Kristallnacht; Auschwitz… It is a template that largely fits well onto the overarching story without having to twist anything to make it work, apart from one major plot device, and allows for some starkly effective imagery: the company become gymnastic, blond-haired Aryan youths at one point, jack-booted vicious soldiers the next, and the swastika of course is powerfully deployed on a number of occasions. Finn Ross’ video design is well-incorporated into the production to allow swift, effective and atmospheric changes of location as Faust is led unwittingly on his journey. The tendency towards giant spectacle though means that several scenes are overstuffed, Giliam’s ambition seemingly untrammelled in the pursuit of his vision. Consequently other aspects which need more attention in what is acknowledged to be a difficult piece, like the occasional longueurs in the music which lack purpose or the whipping into shape of the chorus, both vocally in a couple of places and physically – as in a scene when they are meant to be portraying Nazi stormtroopers, they currently evoke a greater comparison to Dad’s Army – are left lacking. At times, the music is battling against everything else that is happening onstage but when it is allowed in the limelight, it really does shine. The best of the singers is Christopher Purves, making his role debut as Mephistopheles, the self-confessed puppet master whose machinations whether from the sidelines in an easy chair or in the thick of the action with a debonair charm doffing his hat to all and sundry, are never less than crystal clear as he sings with a great precision throughout and is devilishly good fun. Christine Rice has two pretty songs as the doomed Marguerite which she fills with beautiful colour and Peter Hoare is just great fun as the heavily Shockheaded Peter-inspired Faust, vocally a little thin at times but extremely charismatic and listenable. But my uneasiness at the staging was something that grew as the show progressed. I’m not entirely sure why I was so sensitive to the suggestion that the rise of the Nazi party and grooming of Hitler as leader was due to the machinations of Mephistopheles rather than the human race just acting at its very worst with outside help: with a story that punishes an individual for the choices he makes, there’s something difficult about the skimming over of the decisions made by the Nazis and passing them off as devilish intervention. But I found it harder to accept the events of Kristallnacht just being passed off as a distraction caused by his minions in order to get Marguerite out of the picture. The worst offender though was the final scene where the chorus sang a beautiful number, exalting her dead body to Heaven, but in this production she has been shipped off to Auschwitz-Birkenau and the chorus are actually singing to a pile of dead bodies of which Marguerite’s is the uppermost. I found it a hugely crass piece of staging if only for the suggestion that she was the only soul being sent up to Heaven despite being just one of the many thousands that had just been killed. This was such a distraction to me that I barely heard the music which was a real shame as it was a very moving piece."
283,283,Ought To Be Clowns,06/10/2015,mag9l,Showstopper, Apollo,"It’s perhaps a sign of the times that an element of variety has crept into theatreland. Where the West End is usually dominated by plays and musicals, we’ve seen the likes of Vegas-style revues like Sinatra and magic shows like Impossible extend its entertainment remit and now we can add improv shows to the list and not only that, improvised musicals. Created by Adam Meggido and Dylan Emery, The Showstoppers have been making up musicals on the spot for eight years now, regulars in Edinburgh and smaller venues like the King’s Head and the Charing Cross Theatre but they’ve now made the significant leap to the Apollo on Shaftesbury Avenue. Their routine is a simple one – a brand new show at every performance (we were invited to the matinee and the evening show to prove just that) inspired by suggestions from the audience and embroidered into life by 6 performers (from a company of 12) who literally make it up there and then. The first of the day’s shows was Puck Off, a tale of love and wings in an Irish fairy grotto with a jive-talking Puck; the second was The Lyin’ King, set in the jungle that is the Daily Mail’s offices. But in some ways, the details don’t really matter as the show is remade every night from the variety of responses from the stalls and the unexpected swerves that come in their telling. Similarly with the musical influences. Crowd-sourced suggestions included Wicked, Avenue Q, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Gilbert and Sullivan and there’s also moments where songs progress naturally out of the musical doodlings of the band – the superb and incredibly quick-to-respond MD Duncan Walsh Atkins with Craig Apps and Chris As. The constant invention is never less than very funny but it really comes into its own when the group manage to satirise musical theatre even whilst operating within its conventions – the utter randomness of Stomp and the overblown duetting of Les Mis both brilliantly skewered here."
284,284,Ought To Be Clowns,26/02/2015,mag9l,The Nether, Duke of York’s,"Just a quickie for this revisit to US playwright Jennifer Haley’s The Nether, first seen at the Royal Court last summer, which has now transferred to the Duke of York’s and as my colleague for the afternoon said afterwards, isn’t it great to see plays like this with productions like this in the West End. Weighty subjects like the abdication of responsibility in the digital age and the morality of sexual conduct online when it is ostensibly make-believe or “outside consequence” as one character puts it, and a production that reflects its Sloane Square origins in reuniting almost the entire cast without succumbing to big-name casting."
285,285,Ought To Be Clowns,07/04/2013,Ian,Present Laughter, Radio 4,"Casting is everything and Celia de Wolff hits the jackpot with her radio production of Noël Coward’s Present Laughter for Radio 4 by putting Samuel West into the main role of Garry Essendine, the self-obsessed actor at the centre of a social maelstrom caused by his imminent departure on a theatre tour of Africa. West perfectly captures the outraged vanity of a man upset by the temerity of life letting him turn 40 and exasperated by the endless roll-call of people who either want to bid him farewell or can’t bear to see him go. And what a roll-call it is – from top quality classic actors to top notch fresh talent, it sparkles from top to bottom as characters rattle in and out of the offices and spare rooms of Essendine’s house, marshalled by his ever-tolerant secretary Monica, voiced beautifully by a purring Frances Barber. Janie Dee shines as his estranged wife; Susannah Harker is raucous fun as the woman married to Jonathan Coy’s Henry, having an affair with Anthony Calf’s Morris and determined to philander her way into Garry’s bed; and Lily James and Freddie Fox are both good as a pair of besotted youngsters, the former an aspiring actress and the latter a would-be playwright, both determined to have their way with him. There’s not too much more to say than that it’s a highly entertaining 90 minutes of radio and well worth the listen. The cast all flirt excellently with the barbed wit of Coward’s script, all sharp ripostes and offhand remarks of entitled insouciance which are gossamer-light but still carry much weight when performed with such quality.  "
286,286,Ought To Be Clowns,09/05/2011,Ian,Bette and Joan, Arts Theatre,"Bette and Joan is a world premiere of a new play by Anton Burge that takes place over a long day during rehearsals for the 1962 film Whatever Happened To Baby Jane. Long-time rivals, Joan Crawford asked Bette Davis to star with her in this low-budget but high risk venture as they were both experiencing considerable career lows but though ostensibly working together and more alike than either would care to admit, their bitter enmity still spilled out in a number of entertaining ways. The show is set in their separate (natch) dressing rooms, allowing them to deliver their individual monologues, remembrances and anecdotes – often remembered very differently by the two women – and also for a scene in each half where they interact, rehearsing the chair lift scene and bidding each other farewell at the end of the day. Burge’s play succeeds because it doesn’t just focus on the backstage shenanigans on the famous film, although there’s a fair bit of it in here including the wickedly played weight-belt scene, it also takes a wider view of the experience of women working in the old Hollywood system. Indeed one could extrapolate even further into the experience of all working women as the show examines the impact pursuing their careers had on their marriages, their families and the struggles they faced in a male-dominated industry. This worked particularly well for me as I haven’t actually ever seen Whatever Happened To Baby Jane (I’m a bad gay, I know) and so makes something more universal whilst still playing on the well-known legends. It is still early days for the show (I assume it was a preview as I couldn’t find when the press night was) but Anita Dobson was razor-sharp from the off and right on the money with her portrayal of Crawford, still championing the values of old-school Hollywood glamour yet her velvet glove still concealed an iron fist and a steely determination to have things done her way. Her breathy voice oozes false sincerity over her sophisticated veneer but she can’t hide the cracks as Davis’ barbs hit their mark and she can’t always get her own way as she used to and Dobson excels at suggesting the frailties behind the scenes. Her reminisces about her enduring love for Clark Gable were also exceptionally moving and she’s unafraid to show more than a little flesh, repeatedly stripping to her underwear to reveal a fine pair of pins. She was also responsible for one of the best in-character recoveries I have ever seen as her knitting fell off the stage: sheer class! Scacchi took a little longer to get comfortable in the skin of Bette Davis, a much more confrontational character and less obviously funny. She was the one taking the much more daring artistic choices and feeling the effects more than Crawford, wrapped in her (potentially slightly) delusionary cocoon, yet we don’t necessarily feel the same empathy towards her: I’m not sure if this playing up of the abrasiveness was intentional or something still being worked out but it did mean that I was firmly Team Joan from the start."
287,287,Ought To Be Clowns,13/12/2018,Ian,The Cane, Royal Court,"Inspired by Mark Ravenhill’s realisation that some teachers retiring now would have been active when corporal punishment was outlawed in 1986, The Cane is his first new play for a goodly while. And directed by Vicky Featherstone, it is a strikingly intriguing piece of drama which has as much to say about contemporary outrage culture as it does the abuses of the past. Edward is marking 45 years as a teacher and preparations for his retirement do are in full swing. A mob has trapped him and his wife Maureen in their own home though, inflamed by his past use of the cane, and the arrival of their daughter Anna is little comfort as she is long-estranged. And as it turns out she has both a personal and professional interest here, the atmosphere within proves no less febrile than without. Blessed with a superlative cast, The Cane does a great job of really making you think. Alun Armstrong’s Edward seems mild-mannered enough, Maggie Steed’s Maureen is only just a little tightly-wound and Nicola Walker’s Anna is righteously indignant. And almost straightaway, we come to realise there’s so much more bubbling away under the surface or hidden in the attic. Should historical crimes be judged by modern standards? How long does culpability last, particularly when the world has changed so much? Is sorry ever just enough? Questions like these and many more beside rattle around the Royal Court as revenge and recrimination lie thick in the air, the intersecting histories of these three characters brought into stark relief. "
288,288,Ought To Be Clowns,24/07/2011,Ian,The Gift of Lightning, Waterloo East,"The Gift of Lightning is young Irish playwright David Gilna’s UK debut, playing at the railway tunnel conversion that is the Waterloo East Theatre. Initially a story of four young Irish adults escaping economic depression by uprooting to Boston, Massachusetts and living a life of drunken hedonism, things take a darker turn when one of them, Sean, is struck by lightning and falls into a coma. As he lies between life and death, his friends unload their deepest secrets and his own sub-conscious wades through his memories and considerable sexual fantasies as he wakes up to see what difference the ‘gift of lightning’ has had on his life. The construction of the play doesn’t lend itself to this supposed journey of self-discovery. Flitting from work to play and yet more play, Gilna’s writing does little to move beyond the superficial antics of this foursome whether it’s the guys’ attempts to sleep with every girl in Boston or the girls’ exchange of pulling techniques. These are intermittently funny, as the cast of four also play a wide range of funnily-accented supporting characters, broad comic swipes adding to the bawdy sex comedy: there’s little sophistication here but the easy physicality on display and personality channelled into the performances is quite winning. But when the play aims for something more, something deeper, it falls somewhat short. The timeline works against the message of the play, the grand realisation of the main protagonist tucked away into the final scene rather than being skilfully woven throughout the events we have just witnessed. It doesn’t come as a complete surprise as Gilna suddenly grants Sean, the role he coincidentally plays, a sudden depth of character in the latter moments by clumsily having him quote lines of poetry from Keats and later lines from Tennessee Williams: not only does this work against everything we have come to know Sean as being, it’s not even original."
289,289,Ought To Be Clowns,18/11/2018,Ian,Pinter Four, Harold Pinter Theatre,"Thing about blogging is you can’t hide from the past, or your past opinions, so the fact that the first time I saw Harold Pinter’s Moonlight was one of the most torturous hours I’d spent in a theatre up until then is no secret. So the fact that it was included along with Night School in the double bill that makes up Pinter Four gave me significant – Pinteresque even…  pause. But that was seven years ago, people change, as do tastes, and the luxury casting of the Pinter at the Pinter season made it an attractive enough proposition to revisit. And am I a now Moonlight convert? Not exactly, but it did prove a less painful experience, even if it does still maintain a power to elongate time which is exacerbated by its coolly distant demeanour.  Lyndsey Turner shrinks the world of the play down to the bedroom of Andy, terminally ill and raking over his memories with a gimlet eye. As his impossibly tolerant wife Bel cares for him, he remembers past events and lovers and friends but it is an embellished version of the past, Pinter exploring the way just how subjective those memories can be. Robert Glenister is ferociously bitter from his bed, Bríd Brennan is wittily dry as the wife who has her own secrets and there’s a brilliant cameo from Janie Dee as someone from both their pasts. Dwane Walcott and Al Weaver have a much more difficult job though as Andy’s estranged sons, their physical and emotional distance unbridged by play and production (great suits and Converse though…).  Night School proves a more traditional piece of Pinter fare, a slice of East End life full of criminals and gangsters, women who aren’t what they say they are or full-on Hackney chars. It’s lighter and funnier (farcical even) and given a striking production by Ed Stambollouian who introduces a live drummer onstage to reinforce the underlying note of menace. Weaver leads this play with aplomb and I enjoyed Jessica Barden’s performance but overall, Pinter 4 doesn’t quite live up to its predecessors."
290,290,Ought To Be Clowns,16/06/2011,Ian,Realism, Soho Theatre,"New Artistic Director for the Soho Theatre, Steve Marmion, has chosen an ambitious way to start his tenure using one company to perform two plays – one English premiere of an Edinburgh hit and one new commission – both exploring matters of the mind and sanity. The first of these is Anthony Neilson’s Realism, the story of a man who wants to spend his Saturday doing ‘f*** all’, just curled up on his sofa. This he does, but what Neilson explores is that even in the act of physically doing nothing, the mind remains highly active and can take us on a marathon of a journey that can be just as exhausting as actually running one. So the tiniest action our protagonist carries out: opening the post, putting a load of washing in, making some toast, triggers memories and trains of thoughts, delving into the full gamut of the emotionally bruising recent past, sexual fantasies and as far back as childhood but also spinning off into fantastical moments and imagining his own funeral. The hugely endearing Tim Treloar takes us on his journey with great skill, negotiating the peaks and troughs as his conscious and sub-conscious clash in the most bizarre of ways. And it is bizarre. Neilson has conjured up the most imaginative of surreal landscapes all set within the cluttered flat designed by Tom Scutt, so that the raft of colourful characters that populate the mental wanderings emerge from the unlikeliest of places – through the television, inside the washing machine, up from the bin, tucked away in the fridge. And they are a motley crew as well, mixed in with his parents and ex-girlfriends, is a chirpy schoolboy Mullet, his cat Galloway, a group of debating politicians, oh and a troupe of wonderfully profane Black and White Minstrels. It may all sound like a cacophonous whirl of insanity but Marmion’s guiding hand steers a steady course through this journey which is packed full of recognisably, relatable human moments. The unspeakable jokes that run through one’s head, the things one longs to say to cold-callers, the unknown reason for the pre-wash setting on the machine, what Desert Island Discs you would choose. The skill in Neilson’s writing is in creating a real sense of shared experience, so that even in the wackiest moments, we’re never more than a heartbeat or two away from a moment of chuckling recognition or flashes of acute insight."
291,291,Ought To Be Clowns,08/10/2012,Ian,Cross Purpose, Kings Head,"Albert Camus may be better known as a philosopher and author than as a playwright so it is a rare opportunity that presents itself to catch his play Cross Purpose (Le Malentendu) in the Sunday/Monday slot at Islington’s King’s Head Theatre pub. A mother and daughter eke out a joyless existence, running a glum guesthouse somewhere in Central Europe and murdering their rich guests, but when their next victim turns out to be a man with a connection to them both, tragic consequences ensue.  Stuart Gilbert’s translation captures something of the philosophical weight of Camus’ writing, his exploration of the way life is cruel to anyone no matter how intrinsically good or evil they may be, but often does so in a rather cumbersome manner. There’s an archness to the text which also possesses a vein of mordant humour, both of which prove effective in summoning the strangeness of this world. But the turn of phrase occasionally jars in its awkwardness and not all the actors manage to surmount this challenge. Jamie Birkett emerges the strongest as Martha, a haunted husk of a young woman devoid of love or compassion. Even her long-cherished dream of moving to live by the sea has a grimness in Birkett’s hands as the steely glint in her eye suggests the glee anticipated in catering for Jan, their new guest, in their own inimitable style. She connects well with Christina Thornton’s wearied Mother, whose zeal for their way of life has long since died, and her delivery of a key monologue confirms her status as an actress destined for great things. David Lomax’s Jan takes a while to find his groove as Jan, the epitome of kindness and compassion, but soon draws us into the depth of the dilemma that emerges, and there’s fun work from Leonard Fenton as a near-wordless factotum. Melissanthi Mahut’s naturalistic delivery of Maria, Jan’s wife, strikes a duff note though in Stephen Witson’s production, her emotion not sufficiently raw to pierce the soul or mannered enough to fit with the rest of the performances."
292,292,Ought To Be Clowns,03/09/2015,mag9l,The Oresteia, Shakespeare’s Globe,"There’s something a little unfortunate about labelling your version of Aeschylus’ The Oresteia as “a radical reinvention” when Robert Icke’s extraordinary reinterpretation of the same source material for the Almeida has now successfully transferred to the West End. Nevertheless, Rory Mullarkey’s adaptation for Shakespeare’s Globe also emerges as something rather arresting, not least in director Adele Thomas’ canny use of creatives pushing well outside the visual (and aural) aesthetic normally associated with this venue. Hannah Clark’s design pulls on a wide range of influences to provide a wealth of striking images – niche cinema like Angelopolous’ The Travelling Players (the almost shifty looking Chorus) and Jodorowsky’s Holy Mountain (Clytemnestra’s magnificent posturing) mix with contemporary security uniforms (the opening messenger) and traditional Greek costumery as we know it (Agamemnon’s battle-dress). Along with Mira Calix’s diverse (including electronics) score, it’s an eclectic mix to be sure but one that pays off to create an out-of-time strangeness which really suits the production. Mullarkey’s textual adaptation is also an unwieldly collation of disparate elements, poetic rhythm slips into modern-day colloquialisms, epic speeches slides into operatic sung passages. The shifts may be a little jarring at times but again the cumulative effect is rather impressive. The three acts follow the woes of the House of Atreus – Agamemnon sees the war veteran suffer at the vengeful hands of his wife Clytemnestra for sacrificing their daughter, The Libation Bearers sees her suffer at the hands of her son for killing his dad and The Eumenides pops him on trial and established trial by jury, as you do.

293,293,Ought To Be Clowns,23/08/2014,Ian,Porgy and Bess, Open Air Theatre,"The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess (as it appears to be styled here, in case you confuse it with Jedward’s Porgy and Bess) made for a striking component of the Open Air Theatre’s programme this summer. More folk opera than musical, it is perhaps a more challenging choice than usual but none the worse for it, the musical and dramatic spectacle heightened by an impressionistically remarkable design by Katrina Lindsay and director Timothy Sheader’s resourceful production which hammers home its musical strength. From its tragically inclined leads, Nicola Hughes’ sensational Bess with her substance abuse issues and Rufus Bonds Jr’s impassioned dignity as Porgy, through brilliant support from the likes of Golda Roshuevel’s Serena and Sharon D Clarke’s Mariah, to the polar opposites of Jade Ewen’s impossibly pure Clara to croons the iconic lullaby ‘Summertime’ and Cedric Neal’s sleazily cocky ‘Sportin’ Life’ who swaggers through ‘It Ain’t Necessarily So’ as he ensnares Bess with his wares, the sheer size and quality of this ensemble is truly something to behold."
294,294,Ought To Be Clowns,08/11/2019,Ian,I Love You, You’re Perfect,"Expectation can be a funny thing. A revival of Joe DiPietro and Jimmy Roberts’ musical I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change was the choice to christen the newly renamed Chiswick Playhouse (the Tabard as was) but as I caught a version with a luxury cast and terrible venue choice a few years ago, I wasn’t hugely enthusiastic about the prospect of seeing the show again. But Charlotte Westenra’s production emerges as a really rather lovely thing, benefitting from an updating that does a fantastic job of retooling the show for a contemporary audience. There may be those who roll their eyes but the incorporation of same sex storylines and stronger female voices, while still maintaining the integrity of the book, genuinely makes it all the more powerful.   The show takes the form of a revue covering all the highs and lows of love and romance from cradle to grave(side). And as such, can still feel a little slight in it entirety, with no substantive connection emerging in the material. But what we do get, is an emphasis on how universal these stories are – divorce and dating, lust and loneliness, no matter who you are, there’s much to recognise here. And it is performed by a highly personable quartet. Dominic Hodson, Laura Johnson, George Rae and Naomi Slights all impress in their own way, often spinning from heartbreaking to hilarious on a dime and covering a bafflingly large array of regional accents. But the salutary lesson here is about how affecting and effective this kind of inclusionary adaptation is, nothing lost and so much gained.  "
295,295,Ought To Be Clowns,22/05/2014,mag9l,Miss Saigon, Prince Edward Theatre,"There’s a real generational split when it comes to Miss Saigon – a contemporary of such 80s mega-musicals as Phantom and Les Mis, it has comparatively fallen by the wayside in terms of longevity nor has its score really attained the status of a bona fide classic. So there’s a group of people familiar with the show ready and waiting to make comparisons between the original and this major revival at the Prince Edward Theatre, and then there’s the rest of us – me included – for whom this is a new experience. And as is often the case when expectations have been pumped sky-high (“Box office records broken on the first day!” “The greatest musical ever?!” “Watch out for the helicopter…”), it isn’t immediately clear what all the fuss is about. Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil’s book is basically Madame Butterfly redux but transplanted to the Vietnam war as GI Chris is loved long-time by Kim, their love then forced apart by the US defeat in Saigon and a reunion, of sorts, organised once he finally discovers that he left more than his heart with Kim that evening… Laurence Connor’s production certainly looks impressive – a stunning lighting design by Bruno Poet is often breath-takingly good, and Totie Driver and Matt Kinley’s set design is extravagantly striking. But it is all rather unsubtle, there’s so little nuance at play here that there’s precious few moments where any emotion really registers aside from ‘wow’. This bombastic quality extends to Schönberg and Boublil’s score which suffers delusions of grandeur as it pounds away effortfully, yet scarcely managing to fashion a tune that lingers in the mind. Perhaps it is different for those who know and love the score, their emotional investment in the show already considerable and the first night crowd seemed full of them. They would surely have been rewarded by the astounding debut performance from Eva Noblezada as Kim and a sterling turn from Tamsin Carroll as Chris’ US wife Ellen (who gets the one newly-penned song). Jon Jon Briones’ Engineer is a sinister delight as the pimp who controls Kim and Alistair Brammer makes a decent fist of Chris, though better sung than acted as a leading man still in the making. "
296,296,Ought To Be Clowns,18/11/2016,mag9l,Ragtime, Charing Cross,"Mother may spend a song telling us that we can never go ‘Back To Before’ but fortunately you can go back to Ragtime with no fear. And in a post-election climate, it can’t help but feel even more charged as the USA finds itself at a(nother) momentous point in its history. You can read my original review here and if anything, Thom Southerland’s production has gotten even better as the actor-musicians feel even more confident and comfortable.  Leading performances from Jennifer Saayeng and Ako Mitchell, Earl Carpenter and Anita Louise Combe, and Gary Tushaw remain powerful as ever. But on second viewing I enjoyed watching ensemble members and just how damn hard they’re working – Kate Robson-Stuart, Christopher Dickins and James Mack particularly standing out for me… If you’ve not seen the show yet, there’s a trailer below for your delectation but move quickly, there’s less than a month less of the run."
297,297,Ought To Be Clowns,06/09/2012,Ian,I Am A Camera, Southwark Playhouse,"Written in 1951, John Van Druten’s play I Am A Camera will trigger moments of recognition for many more people than will initially be expecting it. Based on Christopher Isherwood’s Berlin Stories, it formed a major part of the inspiration for the Kander + Ebb musical Cabaret in its depiction of a 1932 Berlin whose Bohemian excesses are beginning to be curbed by the rise of the Nazi party to power. Suffering from writer’s block, Isherwood happily allowed himself to get side-tracked in the decadent whirl of the Weimar Republic and right in the heart of the storm, taking him along for the ride, is his great friend Sally Bowles. Spread over a few months, Van Druten gives us vignettes of Christopher and Sally’s hectic lives, as well as those who are drawn into their orbit, like the inscrutable Fritz, the intense Jewish Natalia and the dashingly charismatic American Clive. It is Isherwood’s story, so we delve in and out of his memory – Nicolai Kornum’s lighting crucially good here – as tales of love and friendship play around the hopes, ambitions and trials of this group of people. The combined effect is one of a beautiful portrait of quietly observed humanity in all its complexity. Barely recognisable as Dudley from the Harry Potter films, Harry Melling imbues Isherwood with a sinuous physical grace and a highly appealing charm throughout. His mostly unruffable demeanour makes him a steadying presence, but one filled with deeply felt emotion which comes out in his show of great maturity late on. Around him, Oliver Rix’s debonair Clive is a bundle of hat-tossing sexually ambiguous delight, Sophie Dickson and Freddie Capper negotiate a failed attempt at romance with skill and Sherry Baines’ domineering matriarch makes a strong late impression.  But it is Rebecca Humphries’ effervescent Sally who forms the epicentre of the action. A would-be actress who is no stranger to the company of men, she epitomises the whirlwind of the Bright Young Things with all their carefree insouciance and recklessness. But the spiral is going downwards and Humphries carefully lets us see that beneath the self-obsessed narcissism, there’s an essentially decent person who knows things need to change, and so creates a thoroughly likeable character – no mean feat at all considering the lightning speed with which she changes mood and nature.   Set in the one room – James Turner’s design capturing perfectly the drab clutter of a bedsit – in which Christopher, and then Sally, rents, the rise of fascism forms the backdrop against which these dramas play out and in a clever move by the playwright, it never becomes the focus of the play. Only when it impacts the characters directly do we really engage with it, and this offers a powerful, alternative view of what is must have been like to live through, both from the Jewish perspective but also from the point of view of normal German people just trying to get by, as exemplified by Joanne Howarth’s excellently played landlady who simply falls in line with the newly dominant ideology for a quiet life as much as anything.    "
298,298,Ought To Be Clowns,11/04/2017,Ian,One Love: The Bob Marley Musical, Birmingham Rep,"There’s much to enjoy in One Love: The Bob Marley Musical, not least the joyous celebration of some of the most enduringly famous music in the world. And writer and director Kwame Kwei-Armah does a decent job at balancing the populist demands of a jukebox musical with something more dramatically satisfying. The result has been a sell-out success for the Birmingham Rep and I only just managed to squeak this into the schedule before it closes at the weekend, Using 20 or so of Marley’s songs, Kwei-Armah takes us through an eventful few years in the singer’s life as the success of his artistry launches him from an accomplished reggae musician to international icon, pushing his concerns from simply getting records out to matters of national diplomacy as he finds himself intertwined in Jamaican politics. He also has internal conflicts with his band and a turbulent personal life to deal with, as well as converting to Rastafarianism. There’s much to get through and it is powerfully done in ULTZ’s brightly evocative design taking us from the Caribbean to a punkish take on London. The lead role is performed vividly by Mitchell Brunings, giving us as much as he can about a figure who ultimately remains tantalisingly inscrutable. We see Marley ‘do’ a lot but aren’t necessarily given to understand the why which mutes a little of the emotional impact, which when we do get it, is devastatingly done."
299,299,Ought To Be Clowns,14/10/2009,Ian,Cymbeline, Arts," 
It is not really hard to see why Cymbeline is one of the lesser known works of the Bard. The story feels like a random selection of typical Shakespearean events, flung together haphazardly, and then tied up with a bow at the end in a rather laboured fashion. There’s cross-dressing princesses, wagers about virtue, long-lost princes, potions that feign death, wicked stepmothers, lifelong betrayals, all things that hark back to previous works and little that felt fresh here, not least because of the confusing tone of the play. It’s essentially a romance, with tragic overtones, but not a comedy, something which ought to be whispered into the ear of one of the main performers.It starts with Imogen, a princess of Britain who has secretly married her lowly childhood friend Posthumus. Upon finding out, her father King Cymbeline banishes him from the kingdom, and thus a whole merry load of confusions start. Posthumus is tricked into believing Imogen has been unfaithful and orders her murder, Imogen is forewarned and dispatched to Britain in the guise of a boy, in Britain she meets two random boys who turn out to have a strong connection to her, more betrayals and murder ensue, the god Jupiter pops down for a chat whilst hanging off a tree and then there’s an incredibly neat, interminably long ending. Yet even with the issues around the source material, the production itself made life difficult by also being very confused. The main problem for me was the lack of consistency in the direction. On the very limited space of the Arts Theatre stage, simplicity has to be the key, yet a bewildering array of technical effects were utilised here, often just for a few seconds and then never again. Projections, animations, a live band, shadow-play, voice-overs, lighting, songs were all used in a scattershot effect throughout, with varying degrees of success it must be said, but none of them were used sufficiently to create a theme across the whole production, giving a really disjointed feel. One wonders if the inspiration of the NT’s recent All Well’s That Ends Well proved too hard to resist, despite the huge disparity in stage size. And tonally, I felt too much was made of the humour. It didn’t feel like a comedy, and it wasn’t presented like a comedy, but time after time, they went for the cheap laugh instead of focusing on the humanity of the story, and so it was hard to connect emotionally to much of the piece. That said Rosie Samsom as Imogen and Ned Derrington as Pisario gave two very strong performances which did focus on the more human sides of their characters, and Luke McEwan’s swagger (and impressive hairy chest!) as the titular king belied his apparent youth."
300,300,Ought To Be Clowns,21/03/2017,mag9l,Run, Bunker Theatre,"You might say that it’s tough to be a teenager in this day and age. Add in being Jewish and also gay and there’s a lot to deal with, but the joy of Stephen Laughton’s Run is that this examination of these intersecting identities is never heavy-handed. It is as enthusiastically complex as the 17-year-old Yonni himself and directed by Lucy Wray, Tom Ross-Williams delivers a cracking performance. Stretching just over an hour, Run covers the gamut from the thrill of first love (with Adam, at the ‘Jew Camp’ they both get expelled from one wet hot summer) to the challenge of balancing Orthodox family comforts with the rising anti-Semitism he experiences outwith his native North London community. And in Laughton’s prose, combining poetry and punch, Yonni’s life is richly realised. "
301,301,Ought To Be Clowns,23/01/2010,Ian,Barbershopera II, Trafalgar Studios 2,"Barbershopera II  The show really caught light for me with a brilliant medley of songs during the hairdressing competition which skillfully wove in a whole raft of jokes, both visual and lyrical through five completely different styles in quick succession. Lyrically, the songs are excellent throughout, always provoking laughter, but it is sometimes hard to escape the feeling that this is one (albeit excellent) trick that is drawn out for too long. There’s no doubting the impressive vocal skills on display here and it almost seems churlish to criticise given the workrate, but hard work alone isn’t enough. Production values are perilously, shabbily low, the tunes just aren’t memorable enough, and there isn’t enough genuine quartet singing which minimises the genuine impact that the barbershop style has to offer. With such a surreal story that doesn’t engage one emotionally, there’s only so long one can admire good singing and sadly one ends up feeling a bit blase, despite the technical expertise on show."
302,302,Ought To Be Clowns,27/08/2010,Ian,Clybourne Park, Royal Court,"Clybourne Park is the latest play to open downstairs at the Royal Court, written by Bruce Norris whose The Pain and the Itch also played here a few years ago. This play opens in 1959 with Russ and Bev who are selling their house in Clybourne Park, Chicago for a quick move, thereby enabling the first black family to move into the neighbourhood. This is not going down well with their friends and neighbours and tensions of all sorts are brought to the fore as threats are issued and secrets unfolded. We then flip forward to 2009 where young couple Lindsey and Steve want to buy the same house but knock it down and build from scratch. These plans also do not go down well with the neighbourhood and whilst change has occurred, the same tensions begin to emerge. Norris wrote this play partly as a reaction to A Raisin In The Sun as a way of looking at how white Americans have dealt with issues of race in the past and how in this post-Obama world, whether anything has really changed. And he does it with such style and acerbic wit, it makes it easy to overlook the slight weaknesses in the plotting. One I cannot reveal because it is too spoilerish but waiting four years, really? Another was spotted by someone cleverer than I, with inconsistencies about US behaviour in the Korean War and the last I go into more detail about later in the review. I flag these up now because otherwise this would be a purely rave review as it is fantastic. It is consistently laugh-out-loud funny, it is intelligent enough to demonstrate the complexities in dealing with issues of race from all viewpoints, black and white, liberal and conservative: we see the overt racism of some characters but even the well-meaning ones cannot avoid the pitfalls (Bev unable to see her maid’s husband as a friend offering a hand rather than a domestic servant, Lindsey’s insistence that ‘half her friends are black’). I don’t normally like reviews which bang on about every single performance but the ensemble here are just so good, they deserve it. Sophie Thompson is simply outstanding as the hyper-real 50s housewife Bev: the opening scene with her and her husband having a conversation about the word Neapolitan and other such inanities is probably the funniest thing I have seen this year but Thompson also provides a huge emotional depth to her performance which elevates it from caricature to a truly moving portrayal as we edge closer to the truth of what her behaviour is masking. She is also scene-stealingly good as the wisecracking lawyer in the second act. Steffan Rhodri as her husband Russ, is so tightly wound I worried for his blood pressure but he brought an amazing tenseness to proceedings. Martin Freeman is also excellent in both parts, skirting around the pressurised issues of race whilst trying not to reveal too much about their personal feelings and he has a great chemistry with Sarah Goldberg’s sensational Lindsey in the second half, their marital interplay is a sight to behold. Lucian Msmati and Lorna Brown play a married couple in both halves, bringing interesting dynamics to both couples in their wildly different circumstances, Msamati in particular displaying some great comic skills. And last but not least, Sam Spruell’s minister is another brilliant comic performance in a first half which is stuffed full of them. (Michael Goldsmith makes only a brief cameo so not much to comment on really, though he is good). And on to my slight misgiving, which centres around the portrayal of one of the characters, Betsy, as a profoundly deaf person. I must stress that this particular Royal Court production, which indeed makes its point about the way in which society interacts with disabled people fairly eloquently, both through the way in which people relate to Betsy but also in the way in which several characters refer to a local person with learning difficulties. But slap bang in the middle of a comedy, I couldn’t help but wonder how many people were laughing with, or at Betsy’s attempts at communicating with the world around her. I am perhaps more sensitive than most to this issue as I am deaf myself, but I hope this is not the start of a trend of representations of deaf people being an easy go-to for laughs: earlier this month, Earthquakes in London featured a scene with a teenager mocking and imitating a deaf person which was raucously received. Still, maybe I am too close to the issue to have an objective view on it, I’m just being honest about how it makes me feel. Given that the first half is nearly perfect (all the more impressive given this was the first preview), it is quite an achievement that the play comes together as an impressive whole. I liked the echoes of the dialogue from the first half reappearing later on and the racist jokes scene is perfectly played. Ultimately, I absolutely loved it, the performances are just consistently fabulous with Sophie Thompson reaching sensational heights, the set looks great and the work that must go on during the interval to effect the change is impressive. Crucially though, it is often belly-achingly funny and I just love the fact that it proves that Avenue Q got it right: everyone’s a little bit racist sometimes! Book now because this will sell out. You are seriously bad for my finances – was going to give this a miss but have just booked to go on Friday on the strength of your recommendation! Sometimes I get nervous about recommending things so wholeheartedly, but I am confident that most normal people will love this 😉 Excellent review as always, Ian. I wasn't keen on THE PAIN AND THE ITCH, but I'm interested to see how this one compares. The next play Downstairs at the Court – Nina Raine's TRIBES – is a brilliant exploration of what it means to be deaf (mainly literally but also metaphorically), and has a profoundly deaf actor in the lead role, so I look forward to your thoughts on that (and hope it eases your fear that deafness in theatre is only ever used as a cheap joke – though I agree it's sort of unnecessary in CLYBOURNE PARK, and only incorporated so that every 'minority' – black, gay, disabled – can be 'namechecked' to satirical effect). I can't speak for the night you saw but tonight's audience didn't laugh once at Betsy – other characters' reaction to her deafness though got big laughs, especially Bev constantly shouting in her face. I can see what you mean about Earthquakes (in fact I remember thinking at the time that you wouldn't like that bit) but I think maybe you ARE being a bit oversensitive in this case: I actually thought the production was remarkably clear about where the target of the joke was. It's taken me a long time to get round to seeing this, but it's still excellent in the transfer to Wyndhams.  Inevitable cast changes but Stephen Campbell Moore is so good at delivering two generations of bigot that I almost can't envisage Martin Freeman in the role.  Sophie Thompson still sparkles, perhaps a bit too brightly when playing for laughs, and Lorna Brown is robbed not to get even a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in tonight's Olivier Awards."
303,303,Ought To Be Clowns,22/06/2015,mag9l,Measure for Measure, Shakespeare’s Globe,"You don’t get many Measure for Measures for the pound, in the grand scheme, so Outgoing Artistic Director Dominic Dromgoole probably thought he was onto a winner in choosing it to be part of his final summer season and indeed the last play he’ll direct as AD. But these things come in threes and we’ve been blessed with two other major productions – Cheek by Jowl’s Russian-language version shook the rafters of the Barbican earlier this year and Joe Hill-Gibbons promises to do the same at the Young Vic with Romola Garai in the Autumn. But no matter, we can be assured of diverse interpretations – for the first two at least – and Dromgoole’s version for the Globe does precisely what he does best, unfussily traditional productions blessed with a striking clarity (best evidenced by his superlative 2013 A Midsummer Night’s Dream). Here, we get to see Mariah Gale, one of our finest young Shakespeareans, deliver a stunning account of one of Shakespeare’s more complex female characters in Isabella and we also bear witness to Dominic Rowan ascending to the leading man status (with which he has arguably merely flirted before) as Vincentio. Rowan’s Duke of Vienna has become appalled at the level of immorality in his city and so opts to retire from public life into hiding, allowing his puritanical deputy – Kurt Egyiawan’s wonderfully clenched-jawed Angelo – to impose the letter of the law. Young gentleman Claudio finds himself caught up in this censorious crackdown leaving his sister, the novitiate Isabella, to beg for clemency. Her virginal purity threatens to uncork all of Angelo’s repressed impurities though and through a series of bed tricks and head tricks, the disguised Vincentio seeks to ensure justice is served.  Though oft labelled a problem play, Dromgoole seeks to lighten the mood of Measure for Measure beyond even dark comedy. The licentiousness of Viennese society in amusingly realised in amongst the groundlings, Trevor Fox’s Pompey and Brendan O’Hea’s Garnonised Lucio observe a keenly comic edge to the subplots and under his habit and tonsure, Rowan’s fake friar is really quite funny indeed as he manipulates the action with great benevolence and more than a twinkle in his eye (a quick side note, he should keep his hair and beard dyed dark forever, for – you know – reasons ;-))."
304,304,Ought To Be Clowns,12/09/2018,Ian,Eastern Star, Tara Arts,"With the recent imprisonment of two Reuters journalists – U Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo – for ‘violating a state secrets act’ in Myanmar, Guy Slater’s new play Eastern Star gains the kind of unsettling resonance that sits uneasily like a knot in the stomach. It introduces such a note of despair into proceedings, but also one that encourages us to look at the world as it really is, rather than the neat and tidy way we would like revolutionary politics to be tidied up. Eastern Star revolves around the 1988 ‘Students’ Revolution that ushered in Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement and introduced the figure of Aung San Suu Kyi to widespread international acclaim. Caught up unexpectedly in events was cub reporter Christopher Gunness, working for the BBC World Service and connected to an impeccable source, lawyer U Nay Min. But whereas Gunness was able to go home and go on to have a long and lauded career, Nay Min paid a terrible price for the huge risks he decided to take.  30 years down the line, Slater investigates the lingering impact that this had on the two men, exploring the profound connection it forged between them even if they haven’t seen each other since then, something neatly alluded to in the restless nights that they both suffer in their opening scenes. When Gunness is afforded the opportunity to return to Myanmar, he attempts a reunion, unprepared for the full weight of the emotional labour in revisiting exactly what happened. In the intimate space of Tara Arts, Slater’s direction of his own play can tend a little towards the static, a touch more dynamism wouldn’t go amiss. But there’s no mistaking the commitment his cast bring to their work, under the exceptionally haunting backdrop of Elroy Ashmore’s design. Michael Lumsden convinces as a man worn down by recrimination and the knowledge that he could have – should have – done more, and David Yip is superb as he shows impossible grace under pressure, all the while suggesting the (literally) tortured soul it hides.

305,305,Ought To Be Clowns,25/07/2011,Ian,Encourage the Others, Young Friends of the Almeida,"If you’re interested in theatre and aged between 15 and 21 (or 25 if in full time education – potentially involving some non traditional education, like distance learning programs) and live in London, then you could do a lot worse than joining the Young Friend of the Almeida Scheme which offers a world of unique opportunities to learn about, engage with and create theatre, all for the princely sum of £5. This range of activities includes LAB, a year-long project in which young people create a new production specifically for young people, this year is John Donnelly’s new play Encourage the Others which forms the centrepiece of The Young Friends Festival, part of the larger Almeida Festival running throughout July. The festival pulls together a series of events for young people both as participants and performers inspired the Almeida’s programme over the last year and the production has followed the same logic. Donnelly worked with the group of 14 young actors over a six month period, developing the play as his understanding of what themes had affected them most and what they thought the key issues were, affecting young people in society today. The result is Encourage the Others, a short but powerful piece placing the youth of today in the driving seat as they make their voice heard and assert control – over themselves, over the audience, over society… I was invited to watch a late rehearsal of the show at the Almeida rehearsal space on Upper Street and even without the creative side of things being in place, it is clear to see that there is a fantastic energy at work. I don’t want to reveal too much about the play as the element of surprise is one of its strongest aspects, but I was hugely impressed that there has been no ‘dumbing-down’ for the kids as it were, John Donnelly has written a complex, thought-provoking piece that challenges the viewer as much as it does the actor, especially in the way that it subverts expectations yet maintains a dry sense of humour. Under Lu Kemp’s patient direction, the company have been working on this in one form or another since January, there’s a genuine sense of organic chemistry at work here, both in dealing with the rapid-fire dialogue and also in the way they all relate to each other, lines bounce from character to character but the group dynamic remains natural, disturbing at times but always natural. And naming no names, I could see perhaps 4 star performers in a pleasingly strong collection that elevates this from ‘just’ a youth project to a piece of work that has earned its place on the Almeida main stage."
306,306,Ought To Be Clowns,18/05/2007,Ian,On The Town, Coliseum,"We’re in 1944 and three sailors have just 24 hours of leave to kill in New York and they decide to use it on looking for a girl. It is a simple premise, but one given wonderful life here as the guys variously drink in the sights of the city, sample its cultural delights, chase some skirt but also keep an eye out for romance too. All fun and games but this production never loses sight of the fact that we’re smack in the middle of World War II and that the solace these men are looking for is a strictly temporary measure and so there’s a real bittersweet kick to proceedings that lends a real depth to the show. There’s great performances across the board but it was Caroline O’Connor and Lucy Schaufer as Hildy and Claire, two of the women being chased by the sailors who stood out for me. O’Connor’s yellow cab driving skills were excellently displayed in a bizarre approximation of one of New York’s most well known images but one which was brilliant fun and her vocal talents remained sharp throughout, particularly well showcased in I Can Cook Too. Schaufer was also strong, an opera singer by trade, but making the transition here effortlessly. Ryan Molloy, Sean Palmer and Joshua Dallas all had great appeal as the sailors and I also enjoyed Janine Duvitski, Andrew Shore and the evergreen June Whitfield as the boozy Madame Dilly."

308,308,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Austentatious, Savoy,"It’s been a little while since I’ve been to see the Austentatious guys, absence makes the heart fonder and all that, but a Sunday night at the Savoy proved harder to resist. And once there, I did being to wonder how I could have left it six months to indulge once again in some of the funniest shenanigans you could hope to see on a West End stage. For the uninitiated, Austentatious is an improvised show, whereby a lost Jane Austen classic is performed for our pleasure, based on a title suggested by the audience. Tonight’s play was entitled Queer Eye for the Regency Guy, an appropriate choice for Pride month and a searing tale of forbidden love, funny walks, and avocados. Naturally, it was fricking hilarious (and it was recorded, so maybe you’ll eventually get to see this one!) and was full of the company doing what they do best. Dazzling with their quick-witted inventiveness, amusing with the entire randomness with which they swerve the plot, and mercilessly picking each other up on the slightest slip-up, daring each other to laugh as much as the audience. "
309,309,Ought To Be Clowns,05/12/2015,mag9l,Jack and the Beanstalk, Hackney Empire,"I haven’t booked much Christmas-themed theatre this year in an attempt to try and reclaim a bit of a social life but also because I do find it quite hard to write reviews about pantomimes. By and large I’ve been quite lucky in the few I’ve been to in recent years, sticking to the venues who know what they’re doing (Hackney Empire, Lyric Hammersmith, New Wimbledon) but even with this logic, my fingers were burnt a little with this year’s first festive foray. Marking Susie McKenna’s 17th panto for the Hackney Empire, Jack and the Beanstalk is a raucous, rambling affair indeed, but one blessed with the return of Clive Rowe as the Dame, the actor famed at the only one to win an Olivier for panto. And I have to say that the audience around us were largely loving the whole thing which is kind of the whole point, even if you’re bribing the kids with handfuls of free sweets (it’s only like giving critics drinks vouchers for the interval ;-)) The over-complicatedness seems baffling when you have such talent as Rowe onstage, an old hand at milking the humour for all age groups. Likewise Kat B’s and Darren Hart good double act and Jocelyn Jee Esien and Tony Timberlake’s boo-hiss bad double act are at their best when working the eager audience. Debbie Kurup’s Jack is a strangely drawn hero though, not really a strong presence in the story and consequently overacted (if there can be such a thing in panto) though her singing voice remains impeccable."
310,310,Ought To Be Clowns,04/06/2016,mag9l,Off The Kings Road, Jermyn Street,"Academy Award-nominated stars are appearing in the unlikeliest of places off-West End at the moment, but the key is to work out the connection. Fatal Attraction’s Anne Archer will soon be appearing at the Park in The Trial of Jane Fonda, which just happens to be written by her husband, and Jeff Bridges is now to be found at the Jermyn Street Theatre in Off The Kings Road, as a favour to his friend Neil Koenigsberg, a Hollywood publicist, manager, producer and first-time playwright. To be clear, it’s an “e-appearance” from Bridges, via the medium of pre-recorded Skype interactions but the point still holds, it’s all about the connections. And you might wonder if those connections helped this production into theatres, for it isn’t necessarily the strongest piece of writing from Koenigsberg. Even with a company of just five, Off The Kings Road is too filled with uninspired stock characters whose hackneyed dialogue give them little chance to escape stereotype. Fortunately, Alan Cohen’s astutely-cast production elevates the material, to make a watchable if undemanding piece of theatre. It centres on recently-widowed Matt Browne, a US businessman who has come to London for a week to recapture happy memories of time spent there, only to find his holiday waylaid by the shenanigans going on in and around the small hotel in which he’s staying. And through these gentle dramas from equally damaged souls, Matt starts to work through his grief "
311,311,Ought To Be Clowns,09/12/2012,Ian,Cul-de-Sac, Theatre503,"Whether it’s Wisteria Lane or pampas grass out the front, secret goings-on in the suburbs have long been the subject of fascination and stand-up comedian Matthew Osborn is no exception with his debut play Cul-de-Sac, first seen in Edinburgh in 2011 and now running for a month at Battersea’s Theatre503. But where the most recognisable reference point might be The Stepford Wives, Osborn flips his focus onto the husbands of suburbia to examine the impact of strange events from a different angle. Portly, middle-aged Tim moves into a respectable cul-de-sac in some unidentified corner of middle England with his wife and teenage daughter for a discreetly uneventful way of life. But from the very first meeting with his neighbour Nigel, brandishing an ominous-looking bin bag, it is clear there is a price to be paid for the quiet life. Certain standards are rigorously upheld to keep the eerie calm of the street in place but more than that, everyone seems to be in thrall to unseen kingpin Tony Devereux. Thus an extremely dark comedy emerges as Alan Francis’ Tim tries to resist being suckered into a world where Tony takes what he wants – other people’s wives, daughters, luxury holidays… – and no-one can stop him. His journey is counterpointed by Mike Hayley’s Nigel, initially thoroughly indoctrinated in the ways of the cul-de-sac but soon dreaming of a world beyond as Tim increasingly usurps his place in this mini-society. The pair of actors both work the humorous notes well, especially in a hilariously pathetic scuffle and Osborn’s script is full of zingy one-liners. And along with Julian Dutton’s sinisterly amusing Dr Cole, there’s actually something quite neat about the play’s sole focus on men of a certain age."
312,312,Ought To Be Clowns,21/05/2016,mag9l,The Quentin Dentin Show, Above the Arts,"It’s a big claim for a little show to make but The Quentin Dentin Show gets pretty close in its own unique way. And what a way it is – a bit Rocky Horror, a bit Dale-Winton-presented-Saturday-evening-gameshow, a bit 2am-at-the-Joiners’-Arms, and yet entirely its own thing. Sliding into the late evening slot at the Above the Arts Theatre, it’s that random but tasty slice of musical theatre that you didn’t know you needed at the end of the night. I can describe the plot – frustrated pharmacist Nat and would-be writer Keith have hit a stumbling block in their relationship, as evidenced by a bowl of bland pasta, but are offered the chance of couples therapy (of sorts) when Keith conjures up a supernatural therapist from inside his radio – but that’s only half the story of Caldonia Walton’s production, which magics up the kind of carefree energy that makes you see why it was a hit in Edinburgh. Anchored by the zany energy of Luke Lane as the titular man himself, unable to dole out a life lesson unless it is in song, and supported by his droog-like stooges Friends 1 and 2 (a game Lydia Costello and Felix Denton), it’s nigh-on impossible not to get swept up in this seductive strangeness. As he takes the couple on a series of roleplay games and scarcely hides ulterior motives in trying to get them to partake of a special golden pill, Lane makes a striking leading man."
313,313,Ought To Be Clowns,23/12/2015,mag9l,A Christmas Carol, Noël Coward,"Thing with resolutions is that it is terribly easy to break them. And having resolved to see no Christmas shows this year, Jim Broadbent only went and decided to do A Christmas Carol in the West End. Not having seen him on stage before, I decided to take the plunge just before heading back up north for the 25th and truth be told, I probably should have left it.  This adaptation (for there are many around) is by Patrick Barlow, him of The 39 Steps, and has much of the same knockabout energy of that recently departed show. And in Tom Pye’s set of a miniature Victorian theatre in which the play is a play-within-a-play, puppets fly in and out and a genteel atmosphere of old-fashioned fun reigns, overseen by the indubitable twinkle in Broadbent’s eye.  And though that is entirely right for how Broadbent is seen by many, Phelim McDermott’s production doesn’t quite hit the Scroogish notes that characterise Dickens’ tale. In short, this Christmas Carol has been considerably feckled with both story-wise and character-wise and to little appreciable degree. It’s sentimental rather than sharp, raucous where it could be reflective.  So despite the hard-working company around him covering multiple roles, I was left disappointed. Taken in and of itself, I imagine it could be quite entertaining but for anyone who knows A Christmas Carol, it might be more of a challenge. "
314,314,Ought To Be Clowns,17/07/2014,mag9l,The Colby Sisters of Pittsburgh, Tricycle,"As per the publicity image, Canadian playwright’s Adam Bock’s black comedy The Colby Sisters of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has aspirations of splashy cultural recognition with other North American fantastical worlds such as Carrie Bradshaw’s fabulously-affordable-somehow-even-though-shes-a-writer fashion-dominated New York, or the glossy lives of the spoiled uber-rich teens of Gossip Girl, but it achieves neither with a curiously unsatisfying clunk, possibly the first mis-step by Indhu Rubasingham since taking over the Tricycle."

316,316,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2017,Ian,Late Company, FInborough,"Guess who’s coming to dinner, Toronto-style. The table has been set at Debora and Michael’s oh-so-tasteful upper class home but the atmosphere is thick with tension as their guests are Curtis, the schoolboy who bullied their son Joel – who committed suicide a year ago – and his parents. The meeting has been arranged in order to try and achieve some kind of emotional closure but as it is revealed just how raw the wounds still are, there’s so much more to dig into than a bowl of seafood pasta. The Finborough has long had a record of supporting Canadian writers and Jordan Tannahill certainly seems like one to watch. Directed with an unhurried and unfussy clarity by Michael Yale, Late Company blisters through its hot-button topics of cyber-bullying and teen suicide with real skill, presenting an even-handed look at the issues but what really impresses, is the way in which he drips revelation after revelation into his narrative to keep us constantly on the edge of our seats. For though Lucy Robinson’s scorchingly grief-stricken and vengeful Debora has clearly established that for her, closure means making Curtis pay, the truth of her son’s death is far more complex than that. Tannahill raises the trials of modern parenthood (how to deal with a YouTube drag artist for a son) but counters them with human nature at its most hypocritical (how to capitalise on your son’s death if you’re a politician). And as Curtis’ culpability is called into question, the social gap between the two families looms large,"
317,317,Ought To Be Clowns,23/09/2014,Ian,Ghost from a Perfect Place, Arcola,"I wish I liked Philip Ridley’s work more than I admire it. He has, as one of the characters here says “a remarkable way of looking at things” and his commitment to the uniqueness of his dramatic worldview is certainly impressive, it’s just that I don’t always find that I get it or that I even want to. Yet time and time again I go back to his plays as when it does work, it can have an enormous power (cf Mercury Fur). With the slow but steady establishment of his reputation, many of his earlier works have been popping up in recent years in new productions but it still surprising to learn that this is the first revival of Ghost from a Perfect Place which dates from 1994. Somehow pre-empting and thereby predicting the rise of girl power (think Spice Girls) and gangster loving (think Lock Stock…), it holds a real fascination, if not genuine feeling. The entrance of Torchie’s granddaughter Rio and her colleagues ruptures this world though as their arrival, heralding the dawning of a new age of gang rule, is meant to strike fear into the heart of the ageing Flood and by extension, us the audience. But here the real world has intervened to show us something much scarier and there’s just nowhere near the shock value that presumably these women had on first sight."
318,318,Ought To Be Clowns,14/04/2013,Ian,Children of the Sun, National Theatre,"If it ain’t broke… Adaptor Andrew Upton, director Howard Davies and designer Bunny Christie have had considerable success with previous Russian epics Philistines and The White Guard and so they’ve reunited once again, this time to breathe new life in Maxim Gorky’s Children of the Sun, which has just started its run in the Lyttelton at the National Theatre. Set in a small town in a Russia on the cusp of revolution (1905 rather than 1917), experimental chemist Protasov and his coterie of middle class hangers-on are waltzing through life oblivious to the turmoil outside the gates of their estate, but their tragedy is as much personal as they turn out to be as blind to the needs and desires of each other as well.  Gorky’s writing is remarkably perceptive throughout the play. Written in 1905 as a direct response to the huge societal changes around him, he skilfully diagnoses the malaise of the self-absorbed bourgeoisie and lays bare the blinkeredness of their cosseted ignorance and the hopelessness of their grandiose idealism. But he does it with a real deftness of touch, creating richly detailed characters who are rarely so insufferable that one’s heart doesn’t ache at the inevitability of the violent collapse of their entire world. Geoffrey Streatfeild’s erudite academic Protasov fully exemplifies this – a man full of an acute sense of the growing importance of science in the world yet an abject failure at maintaining the relationships in his life. And Davies navigates this balancing act beautifully, ensuring that there’s a bumbling levity close to hand to counteract the increasing sense of tragedy. Streatfeild is engagingly nerdy and gorgeously poetic as the hapless chemist, unable or unwilling to see the estrangement that is growing with his wife Yelena. Justine Mitchell is just magnificent here as a more aware member of this group and this increasing realisation of the situation as she searches for her long-lost happiness is played to perfection, Mitchell conveying all her intelligent passion just burning to be released yet tempered by the slow, awful realisation of the ways that the cards are falling.  In among the circle of people in their lives, Lucy Black is tremendous as the much mocked Melaniya, a highly tragicomic figure in her fixation on Protasov who finds moments of real depth in amongst the neediness and Paul Higgins, as her brother Boris, is hauntingly effective as a man who everyone sees and yet to whom no-one really listens. As Protasov’s ailing sister Liza, Emma Lowndes espouses a heart-breakingly delicate embodiment of the situation, full of anguish at a world she can see changing yet doomed by her fragile temperament and health. And there’s vibrant work from Gerard Monaco and Florence Hall as a most flirtatious part of the serving class of the household, trying to determine if there is a moment here to be seized."
319,319,Ought To Be Clowns,16/12/2012,Ian,Once Upon A Mattress, Union Theatre,"The Union Theatre’s festive show is this little US curiosity from 1959, Once Upon A Mattress. It’s a playful riff on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale The Princess and the Pea and its endearing silliness and the high campery of Kirk Jameson’s production makes it a whole bundle of festive fun. Jay Thompson, Dean Fuller and Marshall Barer’s book purports to tell an alternative version of events which sees Queen Aggravain come up with ever more difficult tasks for princesses to pass in order to win the hand of her beloved son Prince Dauntless. But when the unreconstructed Princess Winifred – a princess from the swamps – wins the heart of mummy’s boy Dauntless, the queen has to devise the hardest test possible. Jamieson makes great use of his ensemble as courtiers constantly watching the action and so always on hand to sing and dance their way attractively through a range of random numbers. Mary Rodgers’ score really isn’t too memorable but Racky Plews’ choreography is so eye-poppingly vibrant that it almost doesn’t matter. The group scenes thus spark happily into life, none more so than in the dizzying routine of Spanish Panic which is witty as well as impressive.  The show also has more than its fair share of random moments that don’t always fit so well into the flow of the narrative – an extended tap dance break feels like an ill-advised attempt to make us care for a minor character who is then quickly forgotten (though Daniel Bartlett is very good), and the narrating role of the Minstrel didn’t work for me either (though again well performed, by Ryan Limb in this case)."
320,320,Ought To Be Clowns,27/06/2011,Ian,Doctor Faustus, Shakespeare’s Globe,"The tale of Faust is one which is seemingly never far from our stages in one form or another, whether it is opera, another opera or Icelandic acrobatics. But Christopher Marlowe can lay claim to perhaps being the first to dramatise this story back in Elizabethan times and this production of Doctor Faustus marks the first time it will have been performed at Shakespeare’s Globe. A strange mixture of dark tragedy and broad comedy, the play looks at the danger of recklessly pursuing the quest for knowledge, power and wealth without due responsibility. Faustus, tired of his life of dusty scholarship, makes a pact with the Devil exchanging his soul after death for 24 years of service from his trusty servant Mephistopheles. Blinded by the material benefits that easy access to the dark arts garners him, the reality of eternal damnation doesn’t hit until far too late. Played in Renaissance dress and using Renaissance staging as befits the venue, there’s an undoubted charm to the way in which spectacle is introduced to take us into the dark fantasy world conjured up by these devilish men: angels and devils battle in Faustus’ conscience; the Seven Deadly Sins are brought to vivid life; giant puppets rise into the air and flames bursting in mid-air to enchant the audience. But there was something seriously lacking here that meant that it did not cast its spell over me. Part of it comes down to the play I think with its uneasy combination of such a dark central story and the bawdy sub-plots which are almost farcical as less experienced hands try to cast spells with comic results. The lack of darkness to much of the proceedings, compounded by the lack actual darkening sky on this early evening Sunday performance, meant that I didn’t really feel the tragic arc at all. It doesn’t help that there is little to contextualise Faustus as a person before he makes his deal and so Paul Hilton has little to work with to suggest any real depth to his leading man that makes him more than an arrogant showman. Likewise, Arthur Darvill’s Mephistopheles felt rather anaemic too, too often left standing to the side and rarely suggesting his demonic origins. Perhaps I was expecting something more akin to the other Mephisto-figures I’ve seen – all from Goethe though – but I just wanted darker. Pearce Quigley’s clowning was well-received though it really isn’t my kind of thing especially with the musical accompaniment and the vulgar comedy elsewhere also left me alienated. Felix Scott did well in his chorus role and as Faustus’ assistant and the company was generally strong, though I would have liked to have seen much more of Jade Williams. The stage magic is fun, though only one trick is truly great and overall I just wanted more darkness and despair, something that was perhaps never likely on one of the hottest days of the year. I am always happy to see less of Jade Williams on the Globe stage…"
321,321,Ought To Be Clowns,13/01/2014,Ian,Thebes, New Diorama,"The ancient Greek stories of Thebes have proved some of the most enduring, inspiring theatremakers across the years to relate the tales of power-crazed, war-torn tragedy in their own ways and to their own experiences. Here, Gareth Jandrell ramps up the epic quotient by splicing together works by Aeschylus and Sophocles to create his own new play Thebes which spans the entire misbegotten dynasty, and forms the second play in The Faction’s 2014 rep season at the New Diorama. So we see Oedipus’ crazed descent as the terrible truths uttered by the Oracle unknowingly shape his destiny as a most tragic king and we then move swiftly into the aftermath of his death, the power vacuum that emerges that his two sons and Creon battle to fill. Which in turn unleashes its own trail of chaos in the form of Oedipus’ vengeful daughter Antigone who will stop at nothing to do what she feels is right. All the while, the city of Thebes pulses in the background – bearing witness, making comment, passing judgement. And it is this element of the ever-present city, a Chorus of sorts, that defines the visceral strength of Rachel Valentine Smith’s production. The company of twelve remain onstage at all times, performers slipping out of the crowd to take on characters and seamlessly sliding back in to rejoin the group as they respond and react to the varying political tyranny around them. A grieving mass, a marauding horde, a righteous audience, a spitting mob, the chattering classes – it’s an intensely vivid piece of physical theatre that cleverly creates sound and vision that lingers long in the mind. From the ensemble, noteworthy performances do appear. Lachlan McCall’s Oedipus is a cannily uncertain leader, Cary Crankson’s oppressive Creon is studied excellence and Derval Mellett brings a steely-eyed fervour to Antigone. And Christopher Hughes’ amusing take on the unfortunate guard who must relay bad news to Creon is an unexpected shot of light in the unremitting gloom. For in this Thebes as in all others, the corrupting influence of power and over-reaching ambition, and the uncompromising opposition it inspires, proves the downfall of so many."
322,322,Ought To Be Clowns,17/01/2012,Ian,Our New Girl, Bush,"After winning London Theatre of the Year in The Stage’s awards and the considerable success of The Kitchen Sink before Christmas, expectations are certainly riding high at the Bush Theatre as Josie Rourke’s final season as Artistic Director continues. Our New Girl is a play by Nancy Harris, who’s also playing at the Gate with her Kreutzer Sonata, which on first glance bears similarities to Tom Wells’ play as it is set largely in a kitchen, though we soon come to see we’re in a whole other universe (with better plumbing). Hazel has given up her high-flying career as a top lawyer to run an olive oil importing business from home to allow her to spend more time at home with son Daniel and an imminent new arrival; her plastic surgeon husband Richard is away in Haiti on a charitable mission and has engaged Annie, an Irish nanny to help out around the house. But the picture-perfect suburban lifestyle is showing severe cracks: no-one is buying olive oil, Daniel is something of a problem child to say the least and Richard neglected to tell Hazel about the fact that he was getting professional help for her. That the nanny is seemingly perfect at her job only raises Hazel’s hackles further and as things begin to take a more sinister turn, it seems her suspicions may not be entirely baseless. Our New Girl actually emerges as quite a disturbing play, unafraid to attack what it sees as the vast hypocrisy of the liberal upper middle classes and their shocking approach to parenthood. On the face of it, this family seem to have everything but from the off we see just how disquieted young Daniel is – an assured turn from Jonathan Teale, who shares the role with Jude Willoughby – and how sterile the showroom-fresh kitchen is. Kate Fleetwood’s Hazel is clearly stressed, something beyond the fact she’s heavily pregnant, and her reluctance to allow another woman – even one ostensibly there to help out – into her domestic sphere, even unsuited as she is to it, speaks volumes as to the pressures she feels. These are cruelly, and cleverly exposed by Harris as Annie works her way through a list of questions about Daniel in order to ‘get to know him’ and sees how problematic his behaviour is. But it is when intrepid Richard returns from Haiti that we begin to see how twisted the family dynamic is. He seems more interested in the press attention his good work is generating, especially as he is being venerated as a kind of handsome daredevil explorer – Mark Bazeley exuding an ideal laconic charm – and releasing him from his humdrum everyday work. And as Annie reveals herself as the cuckoo in this nest, horrendous selfishness rises to the fore and vicious, earth-shattering, lies are told. This shift in tone is well-executed as Richard’s faintly patronising tone gains a sharper edge and Denise Gough’s Annie reveals how rough she is willing is play. And at the heart of it, Fleetwood is excellent – wryly amusing even when at her most frazzled and drawing us into the heart of her dilemma, as unpalatable as it may seem. Morgan Large’s set design is placed on a wide, shallow thrust which presents its own interesting challenges with the seating, and I’d try to avoid sitting at a diagonal to the corners of the stage as Gwinner quite frequently places her actors in these corners with their backs to the audience, thus the blocking meant a couple of scenes were completely lost to someone’s back. Gwinner could have done with introducing a bit more movement in general to the whole piece as some scenes did feel a little static, but overall this is highly competent work."
323,323,Ought To Be Clowns,13/10/2010,Ian,Onassis, Novello Theatre,"Onassis is a play by Martin Sherman based on material from the book Nemesis by Peter Evans, which was originally produced under the title Aristo at Chichester two years ago. It covers the last 12 years of the life of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis as he wooed and married Jackie Kennedy, flirted with Maria Callas, sailed on his yacht, made shady deals with the likes of the Palestinians which may or may not have been involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Bobby Kennedy. Robert Lindsay plays the central role who dominates everything whether in his personal life or his business affairs and consequently commands the stage almost entirely through the evening with his a foul-mouthed, twinkle-toed massively-larger-than-life performance that at times rises above the limitations of the material. As unfortunately Sherman has made little attempt to tell a story here, what we end up with is a torrent of information and an unchanging presentation of a rich man, even the most tragic of events have little emotional impact since there’s no extra dimension or depth to proceedings aside from an overused continuing reference to the Greek gods. Gawn Grainger is saddled with the unenviable task of a massively long-winded piece of description of the tangled relationships in Onassis’ life, which is then perked up with an amusing projection of a flow chart suggesting a level of self-awareness which is soon sadly disabused as this exposition continues humourlessly throughout with a difficult narration device. Because the focus is so squarely on its lead, the rest of the cast suffer with underwritten characters: Lydia Leonard as Jackie O has precious little to work with but still couldn’t keep her accent from wandering from New England to the Deep South and quite why Anna Francolini’s Maria Callas is on the poster for the show when she is in it for a couple of ineffective blink-and-miss-it appearances is anyone’s guess. As for the rest of the ensemble, the group of employees and staff meld into an amorphous whole which spouts Greek folk songs and proclamations at irritatingly regular intervals. Katrina Lindsay’s white set with its letterbox cut-out and its surround of rippling water is nicely enhanced by Lorna Heavey’s projection work and Ben Ormerod’s lighting, suggesting Mediterranean leisure and Grecian opulence. But in not showing anything of the man behind the money, the empathy beneath the ego, it makes it difficult to form any meaningful engagement with the material."
324,324,Ought To Be Clowns,19/04/2016,mag9l,The Flick, National,"Already garlanded with a Pulitzer Prize and bolstered by articles insisting that “slow theatre” is a thing, it is clear that we’re meant to think that Annie Baker’s The Flick in all its 3 hours plus glory is close to the Second Coming. The reality is a play that it is just a very long time in a theatre for deliberately muted rewards. And it is deliberate, it is precise. Along with frequent collaborator and director Sam Gold, the simple act of mopping up the floor of a movie theatre is strictly regimented, the many pauses surrounding it measured down to the last, slow, tick of the second hand.  The Flick is set in small-town Massachusetts in a run-down, single-screen cinema and lets us follow the lives of regular folk that work there, three people living humdrum lives in a humdrum world. At 35, Sam has worked there the longest but he’s still just sweeping popcorn; 24 year old Rose has been promoted over him to projectionist but her spiky exterior belies a vulnerable uncertainty; and just turned 20 and taking a break from college, Avery is dealing with emotional issues that set him at odds with his co-workers, especially once a pseudo-love-triangle starts to form.  Everything is in a minor key, subtle nuances about the disappointments of life which rarely lives up to the cinematic dream whether in would-be seductive hip-hop dancing, handjobs in the back row or tentative declarations of love. And in these moments, The Flick sparks with life even as disappointment often comes swooping in quickly to extinguish it, Michael Maher, Louisa Krause and Jaygann Ageh giving us all the painful awkwardness of lives that just might have peaked, suffused with the fear that “it’s never gonna get better”. "
325,325,Ought To Be Clowns,21/10/2012,Ian,Elegy, Theatre503,"In Douglas Rintoul’s devised monologue Elegy, the above is a piece of advice given to an asylum speaker preparing for an interview with the officials who’ll determine whether he will be allowed sanctuary or forced to return to the regime from which he is fleeing. But far from a cynical look at how the refugee system can be exploited, this is a deeply impassioned cri de coeur about the horrific realities of life for the LGBT community in post-liberation Iraq, an exceptionally powerful and haunting piece of theatre. Based on a number of interviews from the Human Rights Watch and Stonewall, our narrator is an unnamed gay Iraqi who takes us through his personal history of cautiously optimistic though unrequited first love and the discovery of a careful but active gay community, through to the harsh dawn of a new ultra-conservatism which turned onto even the slightest intimation of homosexual behaviour and his ultimate desperate flight from his homeland. But as if dazed, traumatised by this horrendous sequence of events, the narrative line is shattered. Sam Phillips’ central character reels from point to point with devastating precision, shards of unconscionable stories and fragments of orange-scented memories unravelling in disordered disbelief at what life has become, unrelenting in its tumultuous drive. He also speaks throughout in the third person, suggesting either a coping mechanism to deal with events on a personal level or a greater universality coming from the composite nature of the source material, speaking for anyone, everyone, who has experienced such vehement intolerance, or perhaps both of these. Rintoul directs with a careful restraint which keeps the content from being unbearable (just about) to listen to and Dani Bish’s lighting design is a masterclass in what can be achieved with just the subtlest of shifts. The production’s elusive nature may frustrate some, but it is this blurring and intermingling of elements that lends it such an insistent power, exposing the realities of institutionalised homophobia in such regimes and crucially humanising the refugee experience. The decision to leave is one of the most starkly powerful in the play – “I can’t become a refugee, I have a mobile phone…”, a seemingly trite comment but one which reveals the richness of life that so many are forced to leave behind. "
326,326,Ought To Be Clowns,23/01/2019,Ian,When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other, National Theatre,"It is bracingly refreshing to see the kind of artistic decisions that drive Cate Blanchett’s theatrical career, so often complex, contemporary takes on classic work which show a performer never content to rest on her laurels. Which leads us to her National Theatre debut in When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other – 12 Variations on Samuel Richardson’s Pamela, written and directed respectively by noted iconoclasts Martin Crimp and Katie Mitchell.  And as such, it certainly is something of a challenge. Played for its two hours without interval, Blanchett and co-star Stephen Dillane act out a series of psychosexual, sado-masochistic role-playing games and that’s about it. There’s strap-ons and shaving foam, backseat shenanigans and boxes of cherries, and an untold amount of portentous chat which sometimes, sometimes, sears through to the soul. That’s because Blanchett and Dillane really are top-level actors and both have several moments of inspired work, which it feels an absolute privilege to witness in the intimacy of the Dorfman (the payoff for the ballot, I suppose). And as they, and Crimp and Mitchell, tackle the intersection of gender and power in the fluid flux of contemporary society, peeling back what the roles we want to play say about us, those moments of insight are powerful, particularly in some effective monologues.   Vicki Mortimer’s design recreates a suburban garage to an exceptional degree, Melanie Wilson’s sound design casts a bewitching spell, and the supporting company of four onlookers are a nigglingly intriguing presence which is never quite explained, Jessica Gunning’s increasing role particularly pleasing. Over the two hours though, it’s hard not to want a touch more tonal variety as each new iteration of the game leaves us pretty close to where we were originally. But once you’ve recalibrated your expectations to the way in which the team here are working, there’s something to enjoy in its batshit relentlessness.   "
327,327,Ought To Be Clowns,23/04/2020,Ian,Curtains,,"I enjoyed the Kander & Ebb musical Curtains when it made its long-awaited West End debut over the festive period, and was saddened when its ambitious UK tour had to be curtailed once lockdown was enforced. The producers had filmed a performance from early in the run though for their archive and have generously made it available to watch through their website here. And for the completist in me, it has turned out well as it meant I have the opportunity now to see Ore Oduba in the role that Andy Coxon covered for the West End stint."
328,328,Ought To Be Clowns,09/09/2013,Ian,Much Ado About Nothing, Old Vic,"There was certainly a raised eyebrow or 3 when it was announced that the leads in Mark Rylance’s take on Much Ado About Nothing for the Old Vic would be Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones. Neither have previously taken on the roles of the warring Beatrice and Benedick and having worked together recently on Driving Miss Daisy (which others liked even if I didn’t), their’s is a pairing with history. But undoubted quality aside, it is a brave move to cast so daringly and with a production that relocates Shakespeare’s play to England in 1944.   First preview caveats apply but Rylance does seem to have employed a relatively light touch with his leads – James Earl Jones patently not up to speed yet as Benedick and so frequently feeling dangerously improvised and Vanessa Redgrave’s Beatrice full of subleties which need to be a little amplified so as not to come across as underpowered. Yet the possibilities for wonder rear their head even now, not least in a glorious reading of “What fire is in mine eyes…” as Beatrice reels from her gulling, where one genuinely feels the transformative power of love on the lonely. It’s a potent reminder of why she is the deservedly acclaimed actress she is. Elsewhere the company feels like a mixed bag. James Garnon makes a splendid Don Pedro, his proposal of marriage carried off in a delightful way; Danny Lee Wynter’s Don John needing a tad more depth to display something more than petulance. Lloyd Everitt and Beth Cooke feel like they have the potential to make some affecting out of their unlikely lovers Claudio and Hero, Tim Barlow’s doddery Verges is fun and whilst I enjoy anything that brings more Peter Wight into my life, making him double as Dogberry and Friar Francis seems to make him work very hard in the second half.  I rather liked Ultz’s immobile square arch that dominates the stage, bringing a simplicity to much of the staging which is often dominated (assumedly necessarily) by chairs for people to actually sit in whilst talking. There’s an inexplicable directorial moment during the wedding though as the perspective is inverted 180 degrees which I hope is cut as it jars horribly. The little music there is adds a lovely 40s flavour but I suppose there isn’t time for people to sing more as they are busy with a distractingly ridiculous amount of smoking."
329,329,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,What A Carve Up!,,"As the shadow of another lockdown looms, What A Carve Up! shines as an example of what lemonade can be made from those particular kind of lemons. Produced collaboratively by The Barn Theatre, Lawrence Batley Theatre and New Wolsey Theatre and written specifically by Henry Filloux-Bennett for online delivery, this is exciting hybrid thinking. Based on the novel by Jonathan Coe, Filloux-Bennett and director Tamara Harvey have done a remarkable job here. Covid restrictions aside, it would never have been the most straightforward piece to adapt but reflecting the book’s postmodern structure, this play interleaves multiple layers to build up not just a murder mystery but a damning commentary on the state of the world.  Events kick off with an interview with Julia Hartley-Brewer-wannabe Josephine Winshaw-Eaves, the sole survivor of a murder spree 30 years ago which saw 6 members of her uber-powerful family killed. Then footage of a YouTube creator cuts in and it is the son of the man suspected of committing the crime delving into the archive to try and get to the truth of what really happened. It’s a format that cannily tips its hat to the true crime genre and allows for a spectacular voice cast to participate through ‘found footage’. The inimitable tones of Sir Derek Jacobi and Samuel Barnett particularly stand out as they relish the text, Celia Imrie’s soothing voice steadies us through some tough times and the peerless Sharon D Clarke makes such an impact even in the briefest of appearances.  Fiona Button is magnificently awful as the brittle and entitled Josephine, quivering under the scrutiny of Tamzin Outhwaite’s nicely arch interviewer. But it is Alfred Enoch’s Raymond, the YouTuber, who navigates and investigates this uncertain world with real passion. In search of a truth that might not actually be knowable, he rewinds and replays key phrases in the hope that the evidence might tell its tale. Harry Smith’s sound design works wonders in this, painstakingly winding up the tension."
330,330,Ought To Be Clowns,23/08/2017,Ian,Knives in Hens, Donmar,"It’s no secret that Yaël Farber creates the most immersive of worlds in her theatre but it is still a sensory thrill to allow yourself to submerge entirely into it. The growling rumble of Isabel Waller-Bridge’s score is a thrumming backdrop to the striking splendour of Soutra Gilmour’s set – all stone and earth and timber, an elemental space for the almost ritualistic unfolding of this pre-industrial play. And if Knives in Hens seems grim and dark (Tim Lutkin lights with remarkable economy), Farber introduces a repeated motif of flashes of white – the scattering of plucked feathers, plumes of flour billowing through the air, the gentle fall of snowflakes caught just so in the light, hell even the pale sculpted muscularity of a (surely anachronistically tattooed) bare arse establishing early on the internal dynamics."
331,331,Ought To Be Clowns,01/05/2019,Ian,The Hired Man, Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch,"From the Landor to the Mercury to the Union, via the NYMT and all-star Cadogan Hall concerts, there’s no doubting that Howard Goodall’s British folk musical The Hired Man is one of my all-time faves. Musically, it is so beautiful that you can’t really argue against the marketing material claims that it is “the best British musical in 40 years” (though I might demur and say Top 5…). It is now the turn of Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch and Hull Truck Theatre to revive the show, some 35 years old now, in association with Oldham Coliseum Theatre. And Douglas Rintoul’s fully actor-musician production is brimming with good ideas which serve the material well, teasing out a universality to its message which can sometimes feel hemmed into its Cumbria setting. Melvyn Bragg’s book is based on his own novel and draws on his own knowledge to tell a tale of turn-of-the-century hardship in rural England. But from the cultural specificity here, the musings of the nature of love in marriage speak to us all. The raised revolve that dominates the stage is key here, a device that can both unite and separate as it turns, and a flexible enough space to take us from lonely hillsides to wartorn trenches to treacherous pits. Jean Chan’s design is strongest when letting the abstract bleakness of its backdrop do the talking. An additional cloth suggesting a hilly skyline feels overly fussy and there’s a touch too much colour in the costuming for the impoverished lifestyles being portrayed. Prema Mehta’s lighting is similarly most effective away from the gels, power coming from the balance between light and dark as the Tallentire family battle through.  Casting director Matthew Dewsbury has assembled a very strong cast to take us on this journey. Lauryn Redding’s Emily is excellent, spirited passion thwarted into disillusionment but pragmatic throughout – the timejump may come after the interval but you see her visibly mature in the self-realisation of the gorgeous ‘If I Could’. And Oliver Hembrough is achingly good as John, unafraid to layer gentleness and fragility into his both his characterisation and singing (his ‘No Choir of Angels’ with Redding is stellar), saving booming strength for the most crucial of moments."
332,332,Ought To Be Clowns,07/09/2016,mag9l,The Inn at Lydda, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,"Have you heard the one where Jesus, the three wise men and Caligula walk into a pub? No? Well it is pretty much the set up for John Wolfson’s curious new play The Inn at Lydda, at least once you’ve thrown John the Baptist and Tiberius Caesar in there as well. An eclectic bit of programming in the candlelit surroundings of the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, Wolfson has spun his tale from a tidbit in the New Testament Apocrypha and taken it to almost-farcical levels of comedy. Ailing Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar has heard of a legendary healer over in Judea and so off he pops to be cured by him, only problem is we’re in the days between the Resurrection and the Ascension. Stopping off at a hostelry in the city of Lydda where this news filters through, their party bumps into Tiberius’ lascivious great-nephew and heir Caligula, plus three weary travellers who have been waiting 33 years to reunite with a man who might just be hiding in a nearby cave. And from this amusingly unlikely scenario, Andy Jordan’s production skitters around the slightly uncertain tone. The banter between Richard Bremmer’s Balthasar, Kevin Moore’s Melchior and Joseph Marcell’s Caspar is straight from a Grumpy Old Men sketch, Stephen Boxer’s brutally murderous Caesar has his edges softened by his wideboy doctor (David Cardy’s Thrysullus) and Matthew Romain’s John mourns the death of his friend whilst fending off invites to orgies from Philip Cumbus’ petulant and lustful Caligula."
333,333,Ought To Be Clowns,27/02/2017,mag9l,Scarlett, Hampstead Downstairs,"Colette Kane’s I Know How I Feel About Eve played at the Hampstead Downstairs space in 2013 and she now returns there with Scarlett, another of her plays destined to only be reviewed by the odd blogger due to the no press policy there. I’d be interested to see if it will be open to the critical community when it moves to co-producing partner Theatre Clwyd next month as the rationale behind excluding press – to create “a unique experience” – has always felt slightly odd. Be that as it may, Scarlett offers a sadly all-too-rare opportunity at the Hampstead to see a play that is written, directed and exclusively stars women, something they should be happy to be publicising. We first meet its London-based title character on a weekend away to Wales which has extended into something longer, exactly how long is unsure but she’s been looking at properties in the local estate agent and has found a dilapidated chapel and is ready to buy. Kane shows us Scarlett in search of a new life, painstakingly working her way into the affections of the sceptical owner Eira and her far more amiable grand-daughter Billy, but soon throws in a twist as Scarlett’s mother and daughter turn up unannounced, ready to take her home. What follows is an examination of the different ways people react when they feel suffocated, whether by overbearing family members or all-encompassing grief. Mel Hillyard’s production is a bit of a slow-burner, taking its time to put its pieces into place and even then, Kane’s writing tends towards the enigmatic as she toys the notion of whether Scarlett is experiencing some kind of spiritual awakening or if it is her sanity that has been stretched beyond breaking point. Kate Ashfield as Scarlett and Joanna Bacon as her outspoken mother explore this dynamic well with in their complex relationship, with Lynn Hunter’s butcher-loving Eira a fascinating counterpoint. But the play’s key scene, for me, comes with a gorgeously written moment between the two youngsters. Gaby French’s impossibly-wise-for-a-14-year-old Billy and Bethan Cullinane’s university-age Lydia have nothing overtly in common but through the course of a gently probing conversation, begin to open up to each other awkwardly and yet so deeply honest. It is perfectly played by the pair and speaks to a real emotional truth about the stories we tell ourselves, and others, to deal with internal pain."

335,335,Ought To Be Clowns,17/07/2018,Ian,Much Ado About Nothing, Roman Theatre of Verulamium St Albans,"A first trip to St Albans for me, and to the atmospheric surroundings of the Roman Theatre of Verulamium, where OVO Theatre have established quite the reputation for open-air Shakespeare alongside their more regular programming at the Maltings Theatre. And the prospect of a Much Ado About Nothing drenched in 1950s Americana was one that piqued my interest, even if the well-realised shiny set design sits a little incongruously among the Roman ruins. Adam Nichols and Janet Podd’s bold re-envisioning of the play pays dividends in all sorts of unexpected ways – this is Messina but not as we know it. We find ourselves in 1959 at Leonata’s Bar and Grill, a fine music venue somewhere in the Midwest, where the crew of the USS Gull are to rock up after a tour in the Far East. And in a bit of extratextual business at the beginning, we see Leonata’s daughter Hero Beyoncé her way into the role of lead singer in up-and-coming band The Sonnettes. The name of the woman she replaced? Joanna.  It’s all part of the cleverness of the adaptation that this works on two levels. If you don’t know the play, it makes its own sense; but if you are familiar with it, replacing Don Juan in this manner is a neat little twist indeed. And in terms of the revenge that Joanna exacts throughout, it makes a compelling and convincing rationale. The 50s setting also fits well with the crucial notion of shame, which is lent a bruising, aching power in the shift to a mother/daughter relationship.  Lucy Crick’s sinuous Joanna and Anna Franklin’s open-hearted and genial Leonata rightly make the most of the gender-switch with strong performances. But this play rides on its Beatrice and Benedick and this production has cast perfectly with Faith Turner and Peter Bryans absolutely revelling in this timeless love story. Their connection is less love/hate than love/mild-dislike, such is the strength of their chemistry, and Turner really does give a wonderful sense of her own character to her memorable Beatrice. This is also a production full of music, played live under Tom Cagnoni’s musical direction. And whilst an obvious crowd-pleaser in terms of throwing in any number of classic tunes and full-company choreographed numbers, there were perhaps a few too many of them for my liking, particularly when there was little sense of them advancing the plot. The ones that were most effective were character-based, as in Joanna purring through ‘Walk Like An Angel’, or Beatrice’s discovery of Benedick’s feelings soundtracked by ‘At Last’.  I’m being a little picky because there was so much that was so good here. The gulling scenes were a riot of catering trolleys and cream pies, mannequins and madcap antics. And that boldness to the adaptation here which I found hugely refreshing, not least because several people around me were seeing the play for the first time and I love that they got to see such a positive gender-spin thereon. Also, the interval brownies were a thing of a wonder. Hie thee to St Albans, there’s something a little special here."
336,336,Ought To Be Clowns,04/12/2016,mag9l,One Night In Miami…, Donmar,"Just a quickie for this, as it has now closed. Kemp Powers’ One Night In Miami… takes place on 25th February 1964 in the aftermath of Cassius Clay’s prize-winning fight with Sonny Liston. In a Floridian hotel room, he marks the occasion by hanging out with his friends Malcolm X, singer Sam Cooke and sports star Jim Brown as they reflect on the momentous point in the US civil rights movement that they variously find themselves involved in. And what could have been a dry debate is brought wonderfully to life by Powers’ script, Kwame Kwei-Armah’s direction and a great cast."
337,337,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2014,mag9l,The Hotel Plays, Langham Hotel,"A soldier on leave, a lover in the cupboard, an actress in her dotage; newlyweds, mistresses, hucksters; satin pyjamas, warm croissants, endless liquor. Such is the stuff of many a hotel and in the plush surroundings of the Langham, London, all of the above and more can be found in Defibrillator Theatre Company’s revival of The Hotel Plays, a suite of three Tennessee Williams short plays performed in three suites in the hotel itself. Site-specific performances are sometimes guilty of square peg round hole syndrome but here, the marriage of material and setting is perfect. The seating may not always be the most comfortable but that’s only right as we’re the ones eavesdropping on the private affairs unfolding in these most intimate of surroundings, flies on the wall of Williams’ mini-universes full of heartbreak, hedonism and heists. First up is 1943’s The Pink Bedroom, where Gyuri Sarossy’s married man has kept his mistress, Helen George in blistering form, for eight years. As their arrangement, and relationship, crumbles to pieces, her fury only increases and George is quite simply stunning, pinning audience members with a steely gaze that is impossible to ignore. The writing sometimes feels like an author coming into his strengths rather than demonstrating them but it’s a powerful start. And with 1970’s Green Eyes, the experience just gets better. Newlyweds awake from their honeymoon night with blearily hungover eyes and scratches all over the body. But the strength of his hangover and the her marks on her body set up the most passionate of battlegrounds, where the thin line between sex and violence is painfully erased. It is breath-taking stuff, Aisling Loftus and Gethin Anthony both gripping in their flawed intensity, both hurt and hurting. If 1980’s Sunburst doesn’t quite live up to the same benchmark, it is no fault of the actors. Carol Macready’s retired actress tries to resist the attempts of two Italian hoodlums, Daniel Ings and Jake Mann, to rob her of a jewel, but the play never settles in its attempt to balance humour with pathos and even genuine threat. But the experience as a whole is one to genuinely treasure, threaded together by Linden Walcott-Burton’s earnest busboy appearing in all three pieces, leaving the metaphorical chocolate on the pillow and ensuring we’ve all had a great evening at a rather special piece of theatre."
338,338,Ought To Be Clowns,09/10/2013,Ian,The Light Princess, National Theatre,"Long awaited and long gestated, Tori Amos and Samuel Adamson’s musical take on The Light Princess arrives at the National in a blaze of theatrical glory that makes it one of the shows of the year. Based on a Scottish fairytale, the teenage heirs of warring kingdoms are both mourning the loss of their mothers but their grief has affected them in different ways. Digby’s soul has become weighed down so heavily he has forgotten how to smile, whilst Althea’s protective mechanism has been to become to airily light that she literally floats above it all. As they rebel against their strict fathers, they each escape to neutral ground only to encounter each other and instant attraction. But emotional articulacy doesn’t come easily and political concerns threaten to tear apart their passion before it even really begins.  Marianne Elliott’s direction pulls together the various elements of her huge creative team with exceptional skill, never losing sight of the sheer magic that the best theatre can bring and marrying a very modern aesthetic with the sometimes traditional feel – Althea’s movement (I don’t fly, I float!) is achieved through some amazing acrobatic work from a team of four with just a little help from some high tech flying rig. And in Rae Smith’s gorgeous designs, it all just looks superb; every movement catching an acute moment of emotion, whether the deft manipulation of a falcon into flight (Finn Caldwell and Toby Olié finally making puppetry make sense to me) or a girl literally raising the spirits of a boy (Steven Hoggett’s inimitable physical language once again heart-stoppingly good). As one might expect from a musician like Amos, the score is dense and rich and unmistakeably complex. She eschews traditional song structure for something more akin to Sondheim, unafraid to use short musical phrases alongside lengthier pieces and always maintaining a propulsive storytelling, anchored in deep emotion. We’re not in the land of reprises here but significant melodic phrases do re-appear – the soaring romance of the “you are, you are…” refrain, the quietly magical beginnings of “once upon a, once a”, the martial rhythms of the Sealanders’ anthem – it is strikingly beautiful and demands to be heard again. Lyrically, Amos and Adamson get it right too, along with Adamson’s book. A wry sense of humour – the brothers Grimm and Snow White get shout-outs – is laced with a determined independence from all concerned. Children rail against fathers, servants disobey masters, the headstrong lead the day but as in all good fairytales, they learn lessons. People learn how to deal with the corrosive effects of grief, realise that responsibilities aren’t always there to be shirked, and discover that you can’t dally about in a lilypond with no clothes on without consequences. And giving the story life is a hugely talented and accomplished ensemble, with nary a weak link between them. Rosalie Craig’s Althea, with Owain Arthur, Tommy Luther, Emma Norin and Nuno Silva as the extension of her ever-moving self, is the performance of a lifetime – the physical stamina they show in the various evocations of her weightlessness is astounding, their collective movement simply hypnotic, and on top of that Craig combines teenage angst with a powerfully sensitive vocal that rages with emotions too big for Althea to process – the crumbling of her emotional resolve, when it comes, is almost too painful to bear. Amy Booth-Steel as her ever-faithful companion Piper, Malinda Parris as the serjeant-at-arms and Laura Pitt-Pulford’s compassionate falconer all stand out vibrantly and there’s real joy in hearing Amos write for men for the first time – she delights in testing the extraordinary range of Clive Rowe’s voice (a sadly under-used King Darius) and as the handsome Sealand brothers, Kane Oliver Parry’s Llewelyn and Nick Hendrix’s Digby make appealing princes, Hendrix’s leading man an interestingly subtle choice against the strident feelings of Craig’s Althea.  So there you have it, I don’t imagine it will be for everyone but I absolutely adored it. So much so, that on leaving the theatre, I booked myself a second trip without hesitation, not caring how much it was going to cost me. An absolute triumph. "
339,339,Ought To Be Clowns,10/12/2018,Ian,Nine Night, Trafalgar Studios,"One day – you hope – we won’t have to comment on such things, but not now, not yet. So we celebrate the fact that Nine Night is the first play by a black British female playwright to make it into the West End, as Natasha Gordon’s debut play makes the move from the National’s smallest space in the Dorfman Theatre to the Trafalgar Studios in one giant leap. And it does so with a wonderful, well-earned sense of confidence that ought to see the play thrive. I adored it in its run at the National Theatre (where I even predicted the West End transfer) and Roy Alexander Weise’s production has lost none of its power here. Indeed it has even gained some, as Gordon now joins the cast replacing Franc Ashman as Lorraine.  With the death of her mother for whom she was the primary carer, Lorraine’s attentions turn to traditional mourning rituals, the nine days (and nights) of celebrating her life. But bringing together their British Jamaican family at such an emotionally fraught time brings to light all kinds of long-held secrets and deeply-felt tensions as well as tributes and tears.     Gordon’s writing works so well because it is both specific and universal. Family rivalries and plain-spoken elders are deeply recognisable no matter your background and they’re beautifully done here, especially in Cecila Noble’s titanic performance as the iconic Aunt Maggie. But it is also deeply rooted in the British Jamaican experience, never not relevant but made all the more stark by the revelations of this year’s Windrush scandal. Superb."
340,340,Ought To Be Clowns,23/10/2013,Ian,Hamlet, RSC at Theatre Royal Newcastle,"David Farr’s modern(ish) take eschews star casting for the integrity of this ensemble, giving Jonathan Slinger the opportunity to take on this most celebrated of roles, but it is a chance they take so thoroughly by the horns with Slinger’s determination to put his own stamp thereon, it never feels real or organic, just a strained effort to be different. And at 3 hours 40 minutes, it is a lot to bear. There are highlights – Luke Norris makes an appealing Laertes, Robin Soans oozes quality as ever as Polonius and Greg Hicks gives the verse-speaking performance of the evening as Claudius and the Ghost. But too often, Slinger’s rage as Hamlet is an all-smothering presence which suffocates the production and the actors around him."
341,341,Ought To Be Clowns,23/02/2015,mag9l,Closer, Donmar Warehouse,"Obnoxious people doing obnoxious things for well over two hours – safe to say Patrick Marber’s Closer rubbed me up the wrong way something rotten, and scarcely believing that this was the winner of the Olivier for Best New Play in 1997. Characters float from scene to scene with little genuine motivation, no sense of inner life, just this insistence that there’s something meaningful in being unerringly truthful to one’s self when it comes to matters of desire, no matter the consequences. Some might be tempted to find something contemporary in Marber’s depiction of lustful impulses overriding all, where sex and deceit go hand in hand with the dawning of the age of the internet. But what resonated strongest for me was the outdated manner in which the two female parts, but Alice in particular, are written. Despite Rachel Redford’s best efforts, Alice never breaks through the distasteful male fantasy gaze that posits her as an enigmatic stripper who just wants to be loved by a man (and not just any man…yes, you) – it’s enough to make even the most homosexual of men feel dirty. The dalliances and infidelities that plague the interactions of all four of Marber’s characters cast no-one in a good light though. Rufus Sewell’s Larry blisters into ugly violence, Oliver Chris’ Dan practically revels in his self-doubting, self-destructive tendencies and even Nancy Carroll – how very lovely to see her back on stage again – isn’t immune as her Anna cannot seem to get past her restlessness. And so round and round the merry-go-round they all go, slipping into relationships, marriages, affairs, internet chatrooms with each other but never able to settle."
342,342,Ought To Be Clowns,22/02/2019,Ian,Tartuffe, National Theatre,"The lure of the guru is one which has always been strong for the rich and powerful and from Rasputin to Steve Hilton, there’s always some long-haired, barefoot chancer to ready step in. This partly explains why Molière’s Tartuffe remains so popular today and also why it is so ripe for adaptation, as it done here in this new version by John Donnelly, directed by Blanche McIntyre in her National Theatre debut (and how to marvellous to see her here, I’ve been a fan since her days at the Finborough). Relocated to a hyper-rich, modern-day Highgate – Robert Jones’ opulent design is full of the type of wonderful pieces of furniture you normally only see in shop windows on the King’s Road – Orgon’s family have become concerned at his increasing devotion to his new guru figure Tartuffe. And in Denis O’Hare’s hand, you can see why – he’s quite the charismatic chancer, he spends the pre-show roaming the auditorium giving out flowers and affirmations even though it may, at first glance, just look like someone has come in off the street. And as he weasels his way into his new gaff, he’s also displacing Orgon’s extended family who aren’t best pleased at this turn of events, especially his daughter Mariane (a confident Kitty Archer) who finds her hand offered up in marriage. Kevin Doyle is great fun as the hapless Orgon and the ever-excellent Olivia Williams shines as his wife Elmire, determined to reassert her power back in the household and over the family’s ill-gotten fortunes, whose provenance is causing some of Orgon’s spiritual malaise. The first half is good, if a little stately in places as all the pieces are manoeuvred into place. After the interval though, you can’t help but marvel at the skill and restraint of McIntyre’s directing. Just as soon as she’s let her company loose in all-out farce – Williams proves spectacularly game here and there’s fantastic scene-stealing work from Geoffrey Lumb’s Valère as Mariane’s original intended – Mcintyre’s reeling them back in to find the particular poetic grace of the last scene. And in composing a final tableau that gave me goosebumps, she undermines the foundations of everything that has passed first with a sharp shock, and then a subtler one, tipping us over the edge in a timely reminder that we’re probably all f*cked no matter how many spiritual advisers or friends in high places we’ve got. "
343,343,Ought To Be Clowns,21/12/2019,Ian,Curtains, Wyndham’s Theatre,"There’s no denying that theatre loves shows about theatre and on the Charing Cross Road right now, you’ve got a play within a play at the Garrick right next to a musical about a musical at the Wyndham’s. Curtains ups the ante though by throwing in a murder mystery as well for good measure and the result is a something of a good old-fashioned romp, blessed with that rarest of things, a barely-known Kander & Ebb score. Having only received a few drama school productions (I saw it at Arts Ed)  The show dates back to 2006 but had a tricky road to completion as original book writer Peter Stone died before finishing it, Rupert Holmes stepping in to rewrite, and Fred Ebb also passed away a year later, with Kander and Holmes completing the lyrical content. Curtains managed a relatively successful run on Broadway but for whatever reason, it never made the leap across the Atlantic (into the West End at least) until now, as Paul Foster’s touring production steps neatly into a scheduling gap to provide an alternative cup of Christmas cheer.  It really is all rather good fun. The musical within the musical is reliably daft,  a Western version of Robbin’ Hood, which is interrupted by the murder of its hapless leading lady during a performance in Boston. The detective that then turns up turns out to be a musical theatre obsessive and is more interested in helping the show secure a Broadway transfer. And as writers, producers, directors, chorus boys and girls and critics all have something to say about whether or not the show will go on, whilst avoiding being offed, there’s a tribute too to the trials and triumphs of the creative process.  Obviously aided by a few months out on the road, Foster has nailed the tone of the show perfectly. There’s a sense of fun that occasionally borders on the silly but for the most part, there’s a real precision that elevates and lands every twist of the screwball comedy. Samuel Holmes and Rebecca Lock are fantastically broad as the sardonic director and brassy producer respectively, both wielding their quips like weapons. And as the estranged writer pair, there’s real sweetness in Andy Coxon and Carley Stenson’s performances, as they each strive for artistic perfection in trying circumstances."
344,344,Ought To Be Clowns,15/07/2011,Ian,A Woman Killed With Kindness, National Theatre,"It’s typical really. When Wastwater at the Royal Court played out with hardly any of the (in)famous flair that director Katie Mitchell has become known for, I perversely rather missed it. Now she is back at the National Theatre with a production of Thomas Heywood’s 1603 play A Woman Killed with Kindness, updated to a loose 1920s setting and the kookiness is back. Am I glad? I’m not sure! The show is playing in the Lyttelton as part of the Travelex Season and this was a preview performance on 14th July. The play is noted for one of the first tragedies to be written in the domestic sphere, looking at the loves and lives of everyday people. The marriage of John Frankford and his wife Anne is threatened by John inviting a man, Wendoll, into their home as a companion and to take all at his disposal: Wendoll thus pursues an affair with Anne much to John’s anger. Across the way, Sir Charles Mountford is heavily in debt and constantly in serious trouble due to his ructions with Sir Francis Acton (Anne’s brother). Acton is enamoured of Mountford’s sister Susan and she finds herself an unwitting pawn in her brother’s increasingly desperate attempts to get off the hook. The figure of Anne is clearly juxtaposed against Susan here: both women struggling to deal with a world dominated by male ego and clumsy masculine expressions of power: each has to make their own decisions about how to deal with their life choices and to startlingly different effect. But though the Frankfords’ story is the dominant one, Mitchell has opted to present them as near equals. The set, which is astoundingly realised by co-designers Lizzie Clachan and Vicki Mortimer, is divided in two: the Mountfords’ ageing country pile replete with grand staircase and grand piano on the left and the Frankford’s more modest, more modern looking house with conventional staircase and upright piano on the left. Whilst scenes play on the one side, servants and masters fanny about on the other, sometimes pulling focus from where the attention ought to be and during the first half (although there is no interval), the production really struggles to hold much interest. Heywood’s play isn’t particularly hot on exposition, there’s a number of occurrences that are left baffling unexplained and/or unexplored (especially given the importance of some of them), one wonders why this play has been deemed worthy of reviving in the end? But Mitchell doesn’t provide much clarity in many of her production choices: it’s all very well pitting these two stories against each other, but the Frankfords is where the majority of the action is and it is hard to escape the unbalanced feeling that comes from most of the genuine action happening on one side of the stage though the more interesting characters are on the other. But though it may not always feel like it, there is a method to Mitchell’s ‘madness’: she inspires enduring loyalty in the actors who work with her, at least five here are returnees, and as the play begins to crank up in the later stages, everything starts to heat up and the naturalistic performances provoke greater interest as the emotion heightens. Leo Bill and Sandy McDade’s twisted sibling relationship is nicely observed, his philandering forcing her out of her naturally reclusive ways into the arms of Nick Fletcher’s bombastic Acton. Next door, the gorgeous Liz White (doesn’t she look like Katee Sackhoff, oh how I miss Starbuck) and a handsomely bearded Paul Ready struggle to find real people making real decisions with the sometimes inexplicable Frankfords but Gawn Grainger’s manservant is a master of dry humour and I did like Sebastian Armesto’s seductive intruder. The most Mitchell-like moments are the scene changes: cold light bathes the stage as a multitude of servants appear to rearrange furniture at bustling speed whilst the principals move in slow motion around them, sometimes in reverse, sometimes playing echoes of scenes over and over again. As well as suggesting a curious passage of time, it also reminds us of the importance of the serving classes here, their interjections at key moments of the play are vital."
345,345,Ought To Be Clowns,08/04/2010,Ian,Studies for a Portrait, King’s Head,"Julian Barker is one of the greatest modern American painters, on a par with Warhol and Bacon, but when he is diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, he retreats to his summerhouse in the Hamptons to make preparations for his death, but also with the help of his much younger boyfriend Chad in creating a foundation, for his enduring legacy. There are not the only ones though, as an ex-boyfriend of Julian is hungry for both artistic and financial recompense and things are further complicated by Chad’s other boyfriend Justin, an even younger underwear model, is also staying with them. What follows is a strange mixture of a discussion about to whom the legacy of a major artist belongs and a peek at the über-rich gay lifestyle of the Hamptons, and they don’t always make easy bedfellows. The battle over Julian’s legacy is by far the most interesting part of this play, these men who have influenced his life in different ways all lay claim in some way and desire some reward, just how altruistically any of them are minded is very much up for debate. On the other hand is this odd love-triangle of conflicting loyalties as Chad is pulled between his two lovers, but quite what the younger Justin was expecting when he moved in I do not know, his petulance at being ignored, whilst amusing is misplaced, especially given his alleged deep intelligence. Travis Oliver does well as Chad, whose motivations do ultimately seem genuine towards a lover he’s not ready to let go of and whose legacy he really does want to preserve. His interactions with Simon Wright’s Marcus are also well-judged, wittily played and revelatory of a deeper connection between the two than Chad would ever acknowledge. Reitz clearly has a great line in writing sharp snappy repartee, and it is excellently delivered, especially by John Atterbury’s barbed tongue as Julian, but there’s just too much of it. The banter is relentless and gives little room for pathos to develop, so that when the façade drops unexpectedly as Julian finally confronts his mortality or Marcus holds up a bag of his ashes, we’re still laughing and expecting a joke when it should be genuine emotion being felt. I’m not sure if this was the fault of the writing, the acting, the direction or even us the audience, but the tone of the whole play fell far too heavily on the comic side of tragicomic. Matters are not helped by the amount of flesh on show here. With the house being by the sea, I forgave the early scene with a speedo-wearing Chad but making Justin an underwear model just seemed like a gratuitous way to have a fit young man wandering around in his pants and when it got to the point where they were both spending most of the first half in their designer boxers, it really began to cheapen the drama. One was glad for them emerging fully-clothed after the interval. And the less said about the full-frontal nudity scene the better, completely unnecessary. Ultimately I was left unmoved by Studies for a Portrait. Despite much going for it: incidental music and sons from Boy George, good acting and an interesting set-up about defending artistic legacies written by someone who clearly has a passion for art, the play degenerates into ‘just another gay play’ with little new to say. Well if you will continue to go and see the gay plays in fringe theatres….glutton for punishment. Too many plays with full-frontal nudity, men in their pants strutting around and little else to say. It's often nice to see a well-rounded gay character with a central role in a good play….now I never thought I would find myself saying this, but can we please have some well-rounded straight characters in central roles at the Kings Head? Equal opportunities and all that. Hehe, though I do think it seems that the King's Heads programming has gone hell for leather in pursuing the pink pound and I just hope they haven't lost the rest of their audience along the way. I don't remember it being so homosexually inclined in past years. About the review, I'm not so sure I agree. I found it interesting as it portrays the life of a rich, famous artist. I would imagine that a lot of people would try to somehow attach themselves, there is fame and fortune for the taking.After seeing the play, I did think about it, and found out that Bruce Weber and Karl Lagerfield have kept muses and nudity is normal in both their art. Bruce Weber's muse is still looked after very well by Mr. Weber! So is there a need to hide that fact? I mean I'm young, and if I were in that position and chasing fame, I couldn't say I wouldn't resort to the same thing tbh. Hell at the end, there's a beautiful painting of me, capturing my youth! Which is why I didn't think it was gratuitous. But I admit I am new to theatre, so am I missing something?"
346,346,Ought To Be Clowns,24/09/2007,Ian,The Enchantment, National Theatre,"The Enchantment is probably best described as semi-autobigraphical, clearly heavily informed by her own experiences but not a strict representation thereof. Caddish sculptor Gustave Alland captures the heart and mind of Louise Strandberg whilst she is recuperating in her brother’s Parisian art studio. She tries to forget him by fleeing back to her native Sweden and a life of domestic drudgery, but temptation is strong and she returns to surrender to an utterly unsuitable affair that cannot end happily. This is without doubt Nancy Carroll’s show. As Louise, she is rarely offstage and though posited as ‘just a normal woman’ without any true vocation or artistic talent despite the company she keeps, her luminous beauty and heart-catching fragility of emotion makes her attractiveness completely believable. Zubin Varla’s cool froideur as the charismatic though emotionally crippled Gustave makes a great match for her and their scenes together, though at times extremely wordy, crackle with electricity. But there’s a great cast around this pair too that brings to life the world around them: Louise’s friend Erna, herself a former lover of Gustave, is able to find her own release through her own art, growing into a strong woman as impressively depicted by Niamh Cusack; Hugh Skinner’s as the brother, Judith Coke’s imperious Mrs Knutson, Patrick Drury’s forlorn fiancé, all convince with emotionally true performances."
347,347,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s DROLL, VAULT Festival,"The Owle Schreame’s A Midsummer Night’s DROLL begins with a bit of a lecture, informing us how theatre survived during the Puritans’ purge, by going underground. Rough and ready adaptations of plays, called drolls, were performed guerilla-style – anticipating today’s pop-up theatre festivals…?! – wherever there was a Will and a way. And once the intro is out of the way, we dive headlong into this raucous version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, claimed as the oldest surviving adaptation of a Shakespeare play. With its focus almost entirely on the Rude Mechanicals, it is huge amounts of fun, full of songs, silliness and a real commitment to the value of crowd-pleasing entertainment. Where else would you find Oberon looking and acting like a demonic Womble, vegetable puppets, singalongs to ‘The Wild Rover’ and more, Mustardseed as a sneezing Frenchman, death by broom, even the prototype for Doctor Who’s Lady Cassandra… There’s so much wit and inventiveness and downright oddness at times that you barely notice the quartet of lovers have been entirely excised. But for all the laugh-out-loud humour that is suffused throughout the production, directed by Brice Stratford who makes for a surprisingly charming Bottom, there’s also something deeper here too. The connection and interplay with the audience is a powerful tool which is employed so well here."
348,348,Ought To Be Clowns,16/11/2013,Ian,Henry the Fifth, Unicorn,"The Unicorn’s A Winter’s Tale, written by Ignace Cornelissen from Shakespeare, was something unexpectedly brilliant last year, and powerfully moving – unsure of what to expect, I didn’t think that I’d be crying for a good while after at what was ostensibly a children’s show. So you’d think I’d be pre-warned going into Henry the Fifth, likewise an adaptation of, or more accurately a response to, Henry V, but once again, I found myself weeping, most likely scaring the children around me and even now, I’m unable to look at a balloon without welling up. Cornelissen, translated by Purni Morell, re-envisages the war at the heart of the play as a playground struggle and in Ellen MacDougall’s lucid production, we see that the actions of those concerned are as impactful whether on a school field or a battlefield. The power games of climbing to the top and grabbing it all apply equally in both scenarios but more tellingly, the effect that they have on the people around them can be absolutely devastating. It is such a simple technique but one which is spellbindingly effective. So a balloon and castle-filled sandpit represents France and Shane Zaza’s wide-eyed Henry sets his heart on grabbing it for himself, even as Distant Cousin Nigel (Rhys Rusbatch) wants the same thing, including the hand of Princess Katherine in marriage. But Hannah Boyde’s princess casts off her Shakespearean mantle to emerge as a feisty heroine determined to rule by herself, and so the interactions take the form of a playful game of make-believe, but one which soon snowballs out of control, leaving the boys wondering if it was all worth it. MacDougall utilises a huge amount of theatrical invention, helped immeasurably by James Button’s design, and the call to arms to the audience is for us to harness our imaginations in tandem with the show. The young audience responded beautifully to this, but it also struck me that it was a great way for more seasoned hacks to abandon their own scepticism and revel in the playfulness and wit. I loved the shifting role of the narrator, imposing actions on unwilling participants, but also the callbacks to the original play – Henry’s chat to a soldier is wonderfully done. "
349,349,Ought To Be Clowns,25/03/2013,Ian,The Hired Man, Mercury,"Sampling the best musical theatre that this country has to offer can prove to be a time-consuming business as it is increasingly the case that some of the best work is being done by theatres outside of London. Sheffield, Chichester and Leicester have all made it onto my theatres that I regularly visit now and after this stellar in-house production of Howard Goodall’s The Hired Man (in a co-production with Leicester’s Curve), it seems that Colchester’s Mercury Theatre might be joining that list. It helps that the show can lay claim to being one of the best new British musicals of recent decades – Goodall’s sweeping, folk-tinged score marries strikingly with Melvyn Bragg’s book, based on his own novel inspired by the tough life of his grandfather in the Cumbrian hills, and what results is a work of hugely elegiac beauty. Stretching from 1989 through to 1921, The Hired Man covers a definitive period of British history in depicting the often grim realities of life in the more rural areas of the country at a time of great social and economic upheaval.  David Hunter’s John and Julie Atherton’s Emily are a newly married couple determined to make a new life for themselves but find themselves struggling to scrape a living in a fast-changing world. Jobs working the land are harder to come by, replaced by more dangerous work down the mines and the looming First World War changes everything for all families. But against these major events are contrasted the more intimate personal stories of this family, as the vibrant Emily finds herself disillusioned with the realities of married life and John’s devotion to his work whilst ruggedly handsome men like Kit Orton’s Jackson pay her flirtatious attention. The presence of Atherton should give a clue as to why I made my first trip to Colchester (a surprisingly nice place to visit, lots of great charity shops) as I have long held that she’s one of our finest musical theatre actresses and making a rare foray in period MT was something I was not prepared to miss. And she did not fail to deliver, investing a bruisingly raw emotion into Emily that grips the heart and never lets go. Hunter’s John was also impressively sung, the power in his voice suiting the simple driven nature at the heart of this man, and their’s was a thoroughly believable relationship – tempestuous, full of compromise, essentially rooted in love. Director Daniel Buckroyd first directed this show in 2008 in a much smaller production but though it has been scaled up for bigger theatres, it retains much of the intimacy of a chamber piece which suits the mood of the show perfectly. Mark Dymock’s lighting is highly effective and Juliet Shillingford’s starkly simple design of slates allows for an extremely clever piece of staging later in the show. The tight bond of the ensemble, many of whom take on actor-musician duties in providing musical accompaniment, perfectly reflects the sense of community that lies at the heart of the story – the aforementioned Orton shines throughout and I really enjoyed Mark Stobbart’s lively Isaac and Jill Cardo’s tender May. Richard Reeday’s musical direction and additional musical arrangements are heart-rendingly beautiful, the carefully structured harmonies, the subtle layering of the instrumentation – Rachael Gladwin’s harp deserves special mention – everything ensures that the score soars where necessary, rouses the emotion and should move even the hardest of hearts.  Too often, reviews like these round off by saying this show ought to transfer into London but enough, they need and deserve to be supported in the theatres where they are happening here and now rather than waiting for a future that might never happen. So get investigating trains to Colchester or to Leicester (where as the show will be playing in the intimate Studio it ought to be even better) and sample some of the best musical theatre that Great Britain has to offer."
350,350,Ought To Be Clowns,13/10/2009,Ian,The York Realist, Riverside Studios,"The York Realist is one of Peter Gill’s most well-known plays, and was revived here at Hammersmith Riverside Studios, a theatre co-founded by Gill, as part of his 70th birthday celebrations. It tells the story of George, a Yorkshire farm worker content with his lot in life, until his participation in a production of the York Mystery Plays throws open a new world of possibilities and choices. He discovers a talent for acting, and a relationship with the assistant director blossoms, leading him to the chance of a career acting on the stage in London. But his ties to his home life are incredibly strong, most notably in the form of his ailing mother, and George finds himself torn between these two worlds, these opposing facets to his life which he finds impossible to reconcile. The play works best when it is observing the minutiae of daily living in a small rural community, and Stephanie Fayerman as the mother is wonderful, with lines full of the type of Northern humour espoused by Victoria Wood and Alan Bennett. Stephen Hagan as George is really good, with a great line in dark and brooding suggesting the torment raging beneath the gruff farmer’s exterior, but I was less keen on Matthew Burton’s John, although I suspect that was as much to do with his character as anything. The main problem for me though was that their performances together were basically too convincing: I just didn’t believe that they couldn’t (or wouldn’t) work things out, and that leaving them apart felt very much like a purely dramatic decision to allow for maximum angst."
351,351,Ought To Be Clowns,12/03/2020,Ian,Freedom Hi 自由閪, VAULT Festival,"As a compilation of new writing and performance art by UK based Hong Kong and British East Asian artists, Freedom Hi 自由閪 is necessarily a messy and complex thing. Which makes trying to review it in the conventional sense something of a fruitless enterprise (some might say that about reviewing anything at all…!!). Anchored by a brilliant use of technology – joining the show by Telegram is an additional route in for the audience – and compiled by Kim Pearce for Papergang Theatre, the result is a dizzying montage of dance and drama, poetry and prose, interactivity both in person and onscreen. It aims, and shoots, high and the resulting scattershot fall is thus varied.  And ultimately that’s fine, the feeling is disorientation that sometimes creeps in feels only too apposite in a piece trying to convey the chaos of battling actual repression in the 21st century rather than an abstracted notion of ‘freedom fighting’. So too with the rawness of much of the emotion here, are you seriously going to tell someone to articulate their argument more clearly when it is clearly so deeply, personally felt."
352,352,Ought To Be Clowns,18/05/2014,mag9l,Secret Theatre show 5,,"And so Secret Theatre continues, on their fifth production now which has been devised by themselves and has a shorter run than usual as it will apparently be going to Edinburgh. So press reviews have been scrapped for this one, which may also have been motivated by the devised nature of the show, something which the UK mainstream critics automatically seem to react against. That said, I wasn’t much of a fan at all of A Series of Increasingly Impossible Acts and its highly experimental structure. "
353,353,Ought To Be Clowns,10/03/2014,mag9l,I’d Rather Goya Robbed Me Of My Sleep Than Some Other Arsehole, Gate,"And obtuse really is the word. Rodrigo García’s one-man play, translated here by William Gregory, follows a father railing against the state of the world and its materialistic concerns, who decides to blow his life savings on a road trip with his two sons. He plans to take them to the Prado in Madrid to break in and stare at Goya paintings all night long, the only slight problem is that they would rather to go to Disneyland.  Faced with no stage directions from the writer, a director can let their imagination run wild and Jude Christian’s production is bursting with imagination and innovation. The opening sequence is a gorgeous, surrealist dream that Fly Davis’ set design facilitates magnificently as Joshua Pharo’s lighting swirls around evocatively. And Steffan Rhodri delivers the monologue with a wonderfully warm-eyed twinkle, coping admirably with what Christian throws at him. "
354,354,Ought To Be Clowns,16/05/2012,Ian,What The Butler Saw, Vaudeville,"The adage about theatre audiences turning to comedies in times of economic hardship is being increasingly borne out in the West End and with the arrival of What the Butler Saw at the Vaudeville, the Strand gains its second 1970s would-be laugh-fest. But as with The Sunshine Boys, my funnybone was far from tickled as this is a world of humour I just do not get. In Alice Power’s efficient, if needlessly quirky in its protuberances, set design, Joe Orton’s farce plays out in a psychiatric clinic in which all manner of mayhem is unleashed when a government inspector pays a visit at the same time as a doctor tries to seduce a young woman applying to be his secretary whilst his wife has her own sexual shenanigans to hide. Orton’s intentions were clearly to subvert the farcical form here, to provoke traditional audiences out of their comfortable glow with his deconstruction of sexual and societal values, but this production simply doesn’t reflect that intelligence. What we get instead is something that plays as a straight-up farce. And for fans of the genre, there are some moments to enjoy, especially in the hands of Tim McInnerny’s sweatily lascivious Dr Prentice and Samantha Bond’s nymphomaniacal wife. But the production starts off in such a high-octane gear that there’s nowhere left to go but increasingly overboard in the endless chase for cheap laughs. The biggest offender here is ultimately Omid Djalili as the visiting Dr Rance. Djalili does little to convince that he has much (any) range as everything is delivered in his customary bombastic style: occasionally this works as some of his lines suit this delivery but more than not, the character’s subtleties are largely bulldozed and one is simply left with the impression that this is just a continuation of his stand-up schtick. Conversely, the younger members of the cast make little real impact. Georgia Moffett is curiously unemphatic onstage as the would-be secretary and though Nick Hendrix’s randy bellhop is undeniably well suited to the various states of undress he finds himself in, there’s little than can be achieved with the role."
355,355,Ought To Be Clowns,01/11/2010,Ian,, Wyndhams,"There’s no show really that best typifies my love for the theatre, and specifically my love for London theatregoing, than Avenue Q. From its arrival at the Noël Coward Theatre in 2006, this was a show I fell head over heels for from the opening song and one that has provided constant pleasure to me ever since. Looking back, I think this counts up as my seventh visit to the show, plus one special Valentine’s Day cabaret show, and like every relationship it has had its ups and downs, but ultimately that’s only made my love for the show stronger and I was really pleased to be able to squeeze in one last visit to the final Friday afternoon show to bid it ‘furwell’.     We went on Saturday afternoon, great fun with lots of muck-ups and Tom Parsons trying even harder to make everyone laugh and there was even a dildo onstage during the puppet sex scene!! Agree with you about how good the show is but I heard that it will be coming back to London for next Christmas. Can't believe both this and Sister Act closed on the same weekend, both great shows. Did you get Nicky's end-of-interval song reinstated or was that just the final performance? It's the little video of him singing a song on the toilet while a queue (including Matt Lucas) builds up outside the stall. Jon Robyns and Simon Lipkin also came back at the curtain-call to do a little sketch with the people now playing their roles. I'd figured we'd get ""This show is only for now"" but my friend was howling when she heard that – actually as soon as ""For Now"" started she turned to me and said ""oh my god it really is finishing now!"" No, I think all the special stuff was saved for the last show. Shame I couldn't make it, but by the time I realised I wanted to see it one last time I already had alternative plans and I doubt we'd've got two seats together!"
356,356,Ought To Be Clowns,25/03/2012,Ian,After Miss Julie, Young Vic,"It is turning out to be the year of the Julie for me: having already taken in one production of Strindberg’s Miss Julie by the Faction theatre company, I have two others lined up with Maxine Peake at the Royal Exchange in a new version by David Eldridge and Juliette Binoche taking on Martin Crimp’s interpretation at the Barbican to look forward to. But second up was Patrick Marber’s take, After Miss Julie, at the Young Vic’s Maria studio. Marber relocates the three-hander to a Britain dealing with the Labour landslide victory of 1945 to startling effect. In a world that can taste huge social change on the tip of its tongue, housekeeper Christine makes kidneys on toast for her (almost fiancé) chauffeur John as the rest of the staff party upstairs. He cheekily cracks open a bottle of the finest wine from the cellar and they gossip about the antics of the daughter of the house but when the self-same Miss Julie appears at the top of the stairs, Natalie Dormer in fierce flirtatious form, with her eye set on toying with Kieran Bew’s thoroughly masculine John, the scene is set for a torrid night of sex, gender politics and class warfare. This is a deeply sexy play: the flirtations between mistress and servant are mighty convincingly played by Dormer and Bew and as they play their games, the upper hand continually shifts as each tries to sexually out-manoeuvre the other. But there’s so much more at stake here too: for all the intimations that change is around the corner, the post-coital haze of fantastical plans soon clears and the psychological conditioning that society has imposed upon this pair grimly reasserts itself. It is Polly Frame’s no-nonsense Christine, callously disregarded during the seduction, who emerges with the greatest strength and clear-sightedness, but at what price? In watching her purse-lippedness, John’s inability to deal with his desires in the face of commands from his master and Miss Julie’s disturbingly rapid mental unspooling, it is clear that everyone is damaged. It moves along at a cracking pace and looks fantastic, but there was a detail that did annoy me. Having grown up in a house with an Aga, I was appalled to see Christine’s attempts at making toast. She did it on the wrong side, on the simmering plate which would never be hot enough to toast the bread, plus she only toasted one side which is no way to eat toast. That said, I loved Patrick Burnier’s design which from the moment we enter, ensures we know exactly where the play is set as we descend a long staircase into the ‘downstairs’ of this country pile. Having arrived late, we ended up sat on one of the little banks of seats on the side of the stage, which I’d actually recommend as what little is lost from the occasional front-on blocking is more than recompensed by the thrill of being so intimately close to the actors."
357,357,Ought To Be Clowns,15/08/2007,Ian,Saint Joan, National Theatre,"The play is remarkably even-handed in that it presents all sides of the argument and never really comes down on the side of either Joan or her oppressors. There are no goodies and baddies here, just a girl who believes God is speaking to her and the machinery of Church and State who will do anything to ensure their power remains stable: Shaw’s message is that uncontrolled individualism threatens the established order and is rarely tolerated. As Joan, Anne-Marie Duff is really rather fabulous. Crop-haired and elfin-like, she balances the conviction of her belief that she is divinely inspired with the fragility of a girl clearly out of her depth, naïve in some ways yet shrewd in others, at times self-assured and yet vulnerable and is utterly convincing on all counts: Duff never lets us forget that it is a girl we are watching, not a saint. Supporting her is a raft of fine men, each delivering powerful performances as in each of their own ways, they abandon Joan. Oliver Ford Davies’ authoritative Inquisitor, calm and dispassionate even in the face of delivering a sentence of burning; Paul Ready, petulant and ultimately vicious as the Dauphin; Angus Wright as the slippery Warwick, anxious to ensure that the state is not affected by anything and willing to deal with anyone to guarantee it. I haven’t seen much physical theatre at all so I was quite impressed by how inventive the approach to staging this was. The tilted, rotating stage with chairs lining each side meant that everything that happened was being witnessed by everyone, giving it a really organic ensemble feel rather than the sense that this was a one-woman show. The recreation of the battle involved beating on metal walls which gave an unexpected visceral pulse and the piling up of the chairs to make the pyre on which Joan met her demise made for great symbolism. The evocative original music and costumes inspired by both modern-day military wear and medieval outfits only served to further enhance the experience."

359,359,Ought To Be Clowns,15/12/2013,Ian,Lange Dagreis Naar De Nacht, Amsterdam Stadsschouwburg,"For those new to Eugene O’Neill’s masterpiece Lange Dagreis Naar De Nacht / Long Day’s Journey Into Night, the opening image of Ivo van Hove’s masterly adaptation for Toneelgroep Amsterdam sets the tone accurately as a family drama as the four Tyrones – mother, father, two sons – embrace. But it’s a disarming sequence too, as the next three hours sees this nuclear family unit exploded as drug addiction, terminal disease, alcohol abuse and the bitter frustrations of past and present tear them apart. And they each float around the vast stage of their modern home like isolated atoms, the mind is drawn back to that opening image, reminding of the tragedy of the disintegration in front of us. And though Jan Versweyveld’s beautiful set stretches across a wide and deep space with just the minimalist touches of design, van Hove’s production swells to fill it to the brim with the bruised pain, aching recriminations and crushed dreams of these four who are lost in this world, their inescapable own little worlds in fact, that simultaneously keep them trapped here yet unable to interact in a meaningful way. That opening embrace is inspired by Mary’s return from treatment for her scarcely acknowledged morphine addiction but over the course of the day that follows, the ‘long day’ of the title, her return provokes the subtlest of shifts in their collective self-delusion. It’s a favourite play and Toneelgroep Amsterdam have to rank as one of the most exciting theatre companies I’ve ever seen (both were huge factors in deciding to go to Amsterdam) so expectation was certainly high but I can honestly say it was genuinely excellent. The sheer intensity of the production was just magnificent to behold, the depth of emotion underpinning the performances rendering the surtitles unnecessary as it was often enough just to get completely lost in the moment with the actors, feeling the emotional connection that transcended language through the medium of theatre, and embracing van Hove’s particular affinity for O’Neill."
360,360,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2016,mag9l,Rabbit Hole, Hampstead,"Anchored by a barnstorming central turn from Imelda Staunton (as if there were any other kind), David Lindsay-Abaire’s Good People was a huge success for the Hampstead Theatre, so they’ve returned to this American playwright with his Pulitzer Prize-winning drama Rabbit Hole. The suburban comforts of Becca and Howie Corbett’s family life are wrecked when their four-year-old Danny is killed in a road accident outside their home. Tragedy swallows them whole and grief tears them apart, the divergence in their individual journeys threatening what’s left of their family.  The 2006 Broadway run got multiple Tony nominations and won for lead Cynthia Nixon and in 2011, the superb film adaptation garnered an Academy Award nomination for Nicole Kidman, so the stakes could be considered high for Outnumbered star Claire Skinner here. Edward Hall’s production never quite launches into the stratosphere though; whereas Good People depicted an authentic-feeling US working class life, Rabbit Hole’s middle class milieu doesn’t convince, too stagily British for its own good. The ingredients are all there. Skinner nails the pragmatic fervour of a woman determined to move on by keeping busy and connecting with Sean Delaney’s Jason (the car driver) whereas Tom Goodman-Hill’s Howie finds succour in remembrances and the support group (interestingly only ever mentioned here as opposed to the film which had whole scenes played out there) that his wife so hates. But their emotional repression doesn’t quite have the impact needed to cross the ocean effectively, one is never truly transported out of NW3 and it’s a tension which may be resolved as the run progresses, but proved problematic for me. "
361,361,Ought To Be Clowns,16/12/2015,mag9l,The Lorax, Old Vic,"Then this Christmastime you should hit the Old Vic.The Lorax adapted by scribe David Greigis so damn delightful for tickets you’ll beg. Director Max Webster has served up a treatwith such charm no panto could ever compete. A show for all ages, it’s also a musical, I had my doubts but it’s something quite beautiful. A magic tale that’s pro-environmentalhits corporate greed in a manner not gentle. It’s clever and prescient (dates from ‘71),pertinent as ever, these fights still not won. Charlie Fink’s music may not sound like Dvořák  but it’s perfect for a show that is based on The Lorax. He’s also the frontman of Noah and the Whale, so diverse his songwriting but perfect to scale.  Girl-group style lawyers and rock-based tree-chopping,  there’re also some fast ones that’ll have your feet bopping. Fink’s score is eclectic but enthusiastic,while MD Phil Bateman makes it sound fantastic. The cast is quite special, with two men named Simon. While they are quite different,both sparkle like diamonds. Paisley Day’s Once-ler is a fab green faux-villain,he’s quite sympathetic though trees he be killing. Now Lipkin’s a man who does love a good puppet (to be scared of such things that would make you a muppet). Helped by Laura Cubitt and the ace Ben Thompson,the Lorax becomes a magnificent frontman. He’s funny and grouchy, compassionate and wise,it’s hard to be unmoved by such poignant eyes. I also loved Richard Katz and Penny Laydenand hot pink La Barrie’s a bouncing good maiden. Choreographer McOnie comma Drew,makes dancing look elegant, beautiful too. The set design’s cleverly done by Rob Howell,it certainly hasn’t been done with a trowel."
362,362,Ought To Be Clowns,31/01/2019,Ian,Salaam, VAULT Festival,"It’s Ramadan and Mariam (an excellent Yasmin Wilde) is having to convince her teenage daughter Rema (an equally good Raagni Sharma) of how seriously to take this most holy of months. Their peace is broken when a pigs head is lobbed through their front window but it’s soon apparent that it is more than the glass that has been shattered, Rema’s fragile confidence is in pieces too Sara Aniqah Malik’s Salaam exploring the pervasiveness of Islamophobia, the ways in which its violence encroaches on life whether personally, through personal attacjs, or subliminally, through the unquestionable intimations of phrases like ‘acts of terror’. And she shows us the generational difference too, Mariam able to throw off abuse more easily, in order to shelter her daughter as much as anything. The strength she finds in her faith is something that Rema has yet to reconcile herself with yet, if she ever will. And this is where Salaam soars, in its uncomplicated depiction of the power that belief can bring to some people. Kristina Arakelyan’s original score, beautifully played live on Edie Bailey’s violin and sung by Megan McArthur, amplifies the weight of this cultural pull, as Rema tries to find what place she can as a modern British Muslim woman. Into this world comes barrelling Ellie (Laura Waldren), a well-meaning teenage neighbour, and Malik captures beautifully the awkwardness of teenage interaction, underlaid with the slight menace of the unknown. She’s an essential part of the drama but her arrival also slightly overloads the play at its current length. That said, I would love to see a full length version as there’s something really quite delicately compelling about the story it is telling."
363,363,Ought To Be Clowns,24/04/2011,Ian,Stockholm, Network Theatre,"The Network Theatre occupies another one of the seemingly endless railway arches in the Waterloo area that have been converted into performance spaces and is currently playing host to 3P Entertainment’s debut production of Bryony Lavery’s 2007 play Stockholm. A two-hander about the potentially destructive power of a passionate relationship, directed here by Bronwen Carr, this marks the first time this show has returned to London since the original run at the Hampstead Theatre. At first sight, Todd and Kali’s relationship seems picture-perfect. They have a great sex life, a dream apartment, sneaky afternoon trips to the cinema to see Ingmar Bergman films and they just ooze intimacy and chemistry wrapped up in their own world. But such insularity comes at a price and whilst the dark clouds that start to show themselves are initially amusing – Todd’s anxiety manifests itself with a preoccupation with interior design even whilst receiving oral sex from Kali – the way in which her jealousy threatens to spiral out of all control indicates that things are evidently much darker and more serious. The couple are about to take a trip to the Swedish capital to continue Todd’s birthday celebrations and there’s lots of Scandinavian references and goofing around with funny accents but we soon come to see that the title also refers to the psychological syndrome of the same name in the messy co-dependence of their relationship and the ways in which they each hold the other hostage. Gabby Wong’s viciously manipulative and paranoid Kali is the more obviously insecure half, it is her actions that force the emotional climaxes but Paul Sockett’s Todd is equally watchable, working out his frustrations in other ways, like making dinner most forcefully and their post-fight scene was a genuinely moving moment of contrition and realisation of the self-destructiveness of their behaviour. Movement Director Meline Danielewicz has worked extremely well in aiding Sockett and Wong to negotiate choreography that ranges from comedic disco routines and the faux ninja-stylings of putting the shopping away, the romantic interludes and sexual shenanigans of an intensely physically connected couple to the almost balletic violence that spills over when passion gets misdirected. This physicality is what really pushes the play along and from where the portrayal of this frighteningly convincing relationship gains its strength. There were nice touches of video and lighting work from Simeon Miller too, but Nick Hutson’s sound design was unforgivably muddy, obscuring the additional insights given and the fascinating revelations that came from a flash-forward towards the end."
364,364,Ought To Be Clowns,28/07/2018,Ian,Exit the King, National Theatre,"There’s something intriguing about the fact that Eugène Ionesco has never been programmed at the National Theatre before, perhaps a long-present euroscepticism guarding against a writer at the vanguard of the French avant garde scene (give how much Beckett gets staged, it’s clearly not anti-absurdism). But Rufus Norris has looked to rectify this by commissioning a new version of Le Roi se meurt from Patrick Marber, who also directs here. And as an absurdist drama, Exit the King suggests a bit of different thinking. On the face of it, it’s a simple enough tale – a man is told he only has a day left to live and struggles to deal with it. But that man is a king – King Bérenger – and he’s over 400 years old. And his kingdom is dying around him, with him, stone walls cracking and crumbling away, its people disappearing into the ether, the darkness swallowing everything up whole.   Inspired by the playwright’s questioning of his own mortality, what emerges is a striking, sideways examination of death and how none of us – prince or pauper – are ready for it. Bérenger’s long, slow acceptance of his fate, through petulant denial and woebegotten anguish, is given visceral life by Rhys Ifans in a performance of existential clowning that can’t help but be strange, yet still manages to find moments of resonance within as the old order of things is overturned."
365,365,Ought To Be Clowns,21/03/2018,Ian,Kiss of the Spider Woman, Menier Chocolate Factory,"Despite playing at the Menier Chocolate Factory, this version of Manuel Puig’s Kiss of the Spider Woman is not Kander & Ebb’s 1993 musical, just so you’re clear. What it is, is a beautifully calibrated and ferociously emotive study of love and loneliness and what, if anything, masculinity means.  This new adaptation by José Rivera and Allan Baker casts right back to the original novel, jettisoning memories of the 1985 film too, to trace the burgeoning relationship between two cellmates. Political prisoner Valentin and sexual deviant Molina  have little in common but through their shared trials, something beautiful thrives.    A pained beauty comes from Molina’s recounting of his favourite films as a distraction technique. Enhanced by stunning projection work from Andrzej Goulding, these play out on the surprisingly vast expanse of space created by Jon Bausor’s sparsely institutional design to create a tangible depth of lyrical escapism  And Laurie Sansom’s astutely cast production shimmers and shivers in the quality of its performances. Samuel Barnett’s defiantly queer Molina is beautifully judged in his openness and in his complexities and the way in which Declan Bennett details the crumbling certainties of his strapping Valentin is sensitively done indeed."
366,366,Ought To Be Clowns,17/07/2018,Ian,Jellyfish, Bush,"I know a little something of what it is to be treated differently in this world. Whenever I took an exam at school, college, even university, I would be given extra time, usually an hour, because that was what disabled students got. Regardless of the fact that my only concern was being able to communicate effectively in big echoey halls – I’m deaf y’see – one category fit us all for the differently-abled… And that does something to you no matter how confident you are, to be shunted off to the special room even by the most well-meaning of souls and God knows I had some amazing teachers who provided invaluable help. That feeling of being considered ‘different’ came flooding back to me while watching Ben Weatherill’s achingly beautiful play Jellyfish in the studio space at the Bush Theatre. It’s a feeling that dominates Kelly’s life. At 27, she’s convinced of her own independence and a burgeoning relationship with the slightly older Neil promises much. Kelly has Down’s Syndrome and lives with her mother Agnes though, a mother who has provided unerringly constant care for her daughter and can’t conceive that this could ever be a healthy relationship. She means well, so very well, but at what cost? Does the help she offers square with the needs of a young woman yearning for sexual maturity.  Jellyfish is so tender and true that even as it subtly breaks your heart, it is also filling it with joy. The way in the gentle but only-too-real romance between Kelly and Neil is cultivated through the most unassuming of conversations (played to perfection by Sarah Gordy and Ian Bonar); the jagged edges of a mother/daughter relationship being roughly, but necessarily, reshaped (Gordy connecting beautifully with an exceptional Penny Layden). Such huge depths of feeling run through every scene of Tim Hoare’s production and yet it still maintains a lightness to it, aided by a marvellous vein of brusque humour. This comes largely from Nicky Priest’s Dominic, someone who Agnes thinks is suitable for her daughter because he is on the spectrum. His deadpan ways are spectacular, his t-shirt choices inspired, his developing friendship with Kelly a treasure to behold as they compare notes on overprotective mothers and the difficulties of getting laid when you’re disabled. For Weatherill never shies away from the realities of the situation, of the fact that they are different, no matter how you (I) feel about it. And in the play’s most quietly revolutionary moment, they touch on enormous, unsayable questions like the one quoted up top with a searing, clear-eyed sincerity. It’s one of the most powerful things I’ve ever seen on stage.  "
367,367,Ought To Be Clowns,14/04/2015,mag9l,The Twits, Royal Court,"Truth be told, I wasn’t really a fan of The Twits when I was a kid – the tales of worm spaghetti grossed my sensitive little soul out and I was much more at home reading about the delirious pleasure of the mixing of George’s Marvellous Medicine. So the news of the latest Roald Dahl adaptation to hit a London stage wasn’t one that necessarily filled me with the greatest of glee, especially since this version of The Twits is coming to the Royal Court via a “mischievous adaptation” courtesy of Enda Walsh, a playwright with whom I’ve had mixed experiences, and director John Tiffany. And predictably, it is a curious confection that they’ve cooked up alongside the plate of wormy spaghetti which sent shivers down my spine once again. Aimed at “brave 8 year olds and their families”, it makes little concession to being a traditional family show and mines a rather dark and twisted approach – one suspects Mr Dahl might well have approved – but one which didn’t always seem to connect with the youngsters in the audience at this final preview before press night. The first half in particular saw mostly fitful adult laughter in a tale that is rather stark in its cruelty and political leanings. This comes of course from the source material but also in the additions that Walsh has made, adding in a whole narrative strand to the world of the vile Mr and Mrs Twit – reimagined here as Home Country twits taken to the extreme – and the monkeys they keep prisoner in their garden, determined to train them to stand on their heads to create a circus act. Yorkshire Terrier Man, Tattooed Fortune Teller Lady and The Handsome Waltzer Boy also turn up in Great Missenden, hoping to locate their lost fairground but also soon find themselves prisoner to the emotionally manipulative married couple.  And in Monica Dolan and Jason Watkins’ expert hands, they’re a deviously delightful pairing too, equally at home in the silly slapstick of the endless pranks they play on each other as in the sly suffering they inflict on their captives. Watkins’ skippy walk to the telephone and Dolan’s approximation of the Queen’s Speech are both huge fun and the psychological games they employ involve such horrors as Slade, St Winifred’s School Choir and morris dancing. They are just marvellous in their malevolent monstrosity.  The monkey prisoners – who are a Welsh family of four, naturally – are far more subtle though, hauntingly poignant at times as psychologically damaged victims for whom escape barely seems an option. Oliver Llewellyn-Jenkins and Amieé-Ffion Edwards give especially powerful physical performances here (Steven Hoggett and Vicki Manderson’s movement direction is just spot-on), the latter bonding with Dwane Walcott’s waltzer boy unexpectedly but again movingly. It’s hard not to feel a thrill when they finally gain the confidence to exact their joint revenge.  And this is where the real star of the show comes into play – Chloe Lamford’s magnificent set design. A breathtaking hamster-wheel of a home allowing for a moment of pure theatrical exhilaration that forms the plot’s denouement (and how the children responded to this!) as well as perspective-shifting strangeness which works well in the prank-playing opening act. It also opens out effectively to show us the garden that doubles as prison yard and performance space – a part of Little England that you would never want to get stuck in. "
368,368,Ought To Be Clowns,07/07/2012,Ian,The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Minerva,"Despite feeling like I live in a theatre at time, my experience of Brecht has actually been very limited. When I first saw Mother Courage at the National, I hadn’t got a clue what was going on and it was a rather disconcerting experience all told. My subsequent discovery that all the shenanigans were an integral part of the show left me a little nonplussed, but since then I haven’t had the opportunity to revisit his work, or maybe I just haven’t been looking hard enough… Even when The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui was first announced as part of Chichester’s 50th anniversary season, I can’t say the thought filled me with much anticipation. But the cast was attractive, led by Henry Goodman, and crucially, the word of mouth from trusted souls was excellent and so I booked myself in on a day when those lovely £5 train tickets were available. And I really enjoyed myself, having one of those great experiences where a complete lack of pre-knowledge about the show really paid off to just fascinating effect. Brecht wrote the play in 1941, a story about a small-time Chicago gangster whose violent seizure and control of the cauliflower trade (I know but bear with) saw him ascend to fearsome heights, but the playwright’s true intentions are revealed through the parallels, which are soon crystal clear, with the rise to power of one Adolf Hitler. Forced to flee his homeland once the Nazis had taken power in 1933, Brecht had been able to witness the insidious rise of this ‘gangster’ and so this play speaks of a horrifyingly unchallengable truth. As much as Ui, and Hitler, made things happen to sate their bloodlust, they were permitted to do so by a society which could have prevented them and didn’t. Jonathan Church’s production sounds this message perfectly, with a powerful resonance that we are rightly never allowed to forget, and a clear-sightedness which stripped away much of the Brecht-isms (a choice I definitely appreciated)"
369,369,Ought To Be Clowns,10/12/2007,Ian,Christmas in New York, Lyric,    
370,370,Ought To Be Clowns,16/04/2017,Ian,Threads, Hope Theatre,"We talk about broken hearts at the end of relationships oh so easily, but what if it was actually true, what if a break-up manifested physically on the person left behind. That’s one of the key questions that David Lane’s Threads poses in its exploration of the aftermath of a decoupling. It’s been five years since Vic left Charlie – she’s moved on, apparently onwards and upwards, but he remains in their old flat, in stasis and now calling out for help. Against her better judgement, Vic responds to the plea by returning to their old flat where she’s unnerved by what she finds. Not just in the overt physical decline of her ex-lover whose heart has somehow stopped pumping blood, but also in an apartment that literally doesn’t want to let her go, shifting around her, locking her in. It’s an unexpected twist in what looks to be a conventional relationship drama, complete with squabbles over cups of tea, making it a real curiosity. Lane and director Pamela Schermann have fun with the Philip Ridley-esque quirks – Rachel Sampley’s flickering lighting and James Scrivens’ juddering sound play up the disconcerting moments but ultimately you wish they had been a little bolder. Not necessarily to explain the supernatural but just to feature it more. As it is, the focus shifts onto the complex emotional lives of Vic and Charlie and the more human impulses behind their behaviour. These are given a raw power by full-throttle performances from Katharine Davenport and Samuel Lawrence, hinting at the world they used to share but mainly emphasising the huge chasm that exists between them now. And as emotional blackmail comes into play and the mother of all twists hits towards the end, the intensity rarely lets up. This might mean there’s less room for our emotional investment to engage as the plot tumbles through its late revelations, but is also means it is a short and sharp shock of a play."
371,371,Ought To Be Clowns,30/10/2019,Ian,Ugly / Sherlock Holmes in A Scandal in Bohemia! (and other stories), Tristan Bates Theatre,"Written by Perdita Stott and directed by Danäe Cambrook, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Ugly is a devised piece, such is its rambunctious energy and freeform nature. Tackling societal conceptions of beauty and the challenge they place on women who may feel they don’t, or can’t live up to that image, a company of five play thirty different women whose stories all centre on the notion of self-image. It is inventively and intriguingly done. Cheerleader routines morph into powerful speeches, gospel songs slide into Disney fever dreams, a keep fit session sit right next to aerobic exercise of the bedroom kind. This approach can feel a little scattergun at times, but it is anchored by a deep sincerity to the words being spoken. As tale is layered upon tale, a weightiness is gathered which ultimately feels more effective than what might have been achieved through your regular narrative drive. The corrosive effect of social media and the pressure to take the perfect photo is achingly portrayed, as is the disturbing revelations about performative fake orgasms for lovers desensitised by porn. But Stott is careful not to suggest her overall thesis is a new phenomenon. Other vignettes point to inherited patterns of behaviour from mothers dealing with their own unhappiness, the ever-pressing issue of how seriously we take the comments of others remains true whether they’ve given on Facebook or face to face. The company of Eve Atkinson, Shereener Browne, Samantha Bingley, Hannah Marie Davis and Orla Sanders all impress in their own way with a pleasing diversity of UK accents, Davis’ heart-wrenching quiet desperation really hits home though, and Bingley is ferociously good as inner demons try to chip away at an innate confidence. Witty, heartbreaking, wise and fierce – sometimes all at the same time – Ugly makes for a powerful hour of important theatre.  Also with five women in its company and a female-led creative team, Struts and Frets Theatre Company’s Sherlock Holmes in A Scandal in Bohemia! (and other stories) takes a different route to giving women a voice. Writer and director Francesca De Sica riffs on Arthur Conan Doyle by adding an anti-patriarchal lens to her rewriting of the titular short story, adding in swift detours to some other recognisable tales to further bolster her case. The result here is an amiably rough-edged affair, characterised by the offer of pie and gin as you enter the theatre. The production was designed as a pop-up affair, reflected in a make-do design aesthetic (those camera flashes!) and a multi-roling ensemble, there’s even a touch of audience interaction for the bold. These all enliven what ultimately ends up as an interpretation that doesn’t cleave too far from the source material, albeit with a line of bawdy humour threaded throughout."
372,372,Ought To Be Clowns,15/01/2015,Ian,Othello, Lyric Hammersmith,"At the hint of something daring and innovative in a production of one of Shakespeare’s plays, it is all too easy to fall back on the truism that it probably isn’t for purists – heaven knows I was guilty of it just last week. But whereas not all adaptations necessarily work that well, Frantic Assembly’s brutal and breathless reimagining of Othello – arriving at the Lyric Hammersmith after a UK tour – is exactly the type of thing that purists should be made to see as a thrilling example of how powerful and effective an interpretation can be. And that is what this Othello is in the end. To start counting the characters who’ve been excised, noting which speeches are spoken by someone else or which plot details have been omitted is to utterly miss the point. Adaptors Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett have brilliantly managed to take the play apart, capture its essence but then reconstruct it into something familiar but new. Full-length traditional productions (of variable quality) are two-a-penny but oh so rarely is Shakespeare this pulsating and compelling and visceral and modern. Being a Frantic Assembly show means that there’s movement, and such movement too. The opening 10 minute sequence is breath-taking as it elevates the mundanity of pub life into something of balletic beauty to the insistent sound of Hybrid’s trance-like electronic score –setting the scene perfectly – and later on, shot-fuelled benders, fights and shags on the pool table receive a similarly stunning visual treatment. And though it might be heretical to say, the richness of the physical language – originally choreographed by Graham and Hoggett and further refined by Graham and Eddie Kay – speaks with just as much eloquence as the most poetic of the Bard’s passages. So with (textual) losses come (production) gains as the play shifts onto an entirely different level. The setting is a rough-looking modern-day West Yorkshire pub called The Cyprus, ruled by the street gang of whom Othello is the leader and stalked by marauding rivals the Turks. And in a world suffused with such violence, the machinations of ambitious lieutenant Iago slot in perfectly – Steven Miller’s lean physicality giving a malevolent but relatable portrait of frustrated working-class masculinity, pushing hard against his all-consuming jealousy of Mark Ebulué’s Moor, who is actually a refreshingly normal guy underneath it all. Likewise, the women come across completely differently here too – brimming with a swaggering confidence that matches their male compatriots and in full control of their sexuality. Leila Crerar’s Emilia is movingly done and Kirsty Oswald’s Desdemona is just spell-binding, able to bend Othello’s will with a well-judged hip grind and well able to argue the toss with him – their relationship feels so much more palpable that it becomes that much more devastating as it comes undone to her uncomprehending distress."
373,373,Ought To Be Clowns,29/04/2017,Ian,Obsession, Barbican,"It has been impossible to ignore the reception of Ivo van Hove’s Obsession, the slight sense of glee (from some) at being able to dole out a critical drubbing to the feted director. And so I went into the Barbican with a slight sense of defensiveness – I’m only human after all – albeit with the knowledge that no-one is infallible. And whilst Obsession isn’t necessarily van Hove at his best (and lord know we’ve been spoiled there), it still makes for a fascinating piece of theatre. Based on Luchino Visconti’s 1943 film, adapted by Jan Peter Gerrits and crucially, having its English version written by Simon Stephens, this is an altogether more abstract and expressionist affair than perhaps some were expecting. A tale of sex and murder, whose muscularity and moodiness sprawls over the vast stage with stylish languour, there’s a brooding beauty to the intensity here, captured excellently by two striking lead performances from Jude Law and Halina Reijn. Law’s Gino is a charismatic drifter whose chance visit to a diner where Reijn’s (absolutely stunning in the title role of van Hove’s Maria Stuart) Hanna works sets sparks aflying as the sexual tension between instantly ignites. A small problem is that the diner is owned by Hanna’s abusive husband Joseph (a marvellously horrid Gijs Scholten van Aschat) but even as they plot together, it’s clear that more deep-seated issues lie in their lustful connection, not least a homoerotic subplot. Jan Versweyveld’s design and Tal Yarden’s video construct the by-now familiar deconstructed modernist aesthetic of so much of van Hove’s work and with traditional notions of drama being discarded akin to Lazarus, Law and Reijn really have to #werk here. And that they do vividly – sexually explosive together, substantively different when apart, the physicality that both bring to the stage goes a long way to giving the production life. "
374,374,Ought To Be Clowns,25/02/2019,Ian,Warped, VAULT Festival,"It’s interesting, isn’t it, to consider the figures that society chooses to lionise, the things we’re willing to forgive or forget once a shadow of historical distance appears. The Kray twins are a case in point, some adaptation or other of their story never far from our screens, serving to usher them if not to the status of national treasure then to a pantheon of questionable British icons (we’ll discuss Churchill another day…). Russell Lucas (producer and director) and Martin Malcolm’s (writer) Warped challenges the romanticised commercialisation of that legacy by framing questions of contemporary male behaviour around it. Is it any wonder that toxic masculinity is rife when these are the myths that young men are encouraged to look to? Through the eyes of Aaron and Matty, whose idolisation has gone to extreme levels, we’re forced to face its consequences. A forceful two-hander, Warped works best when its hero worship is under the microscope. For though Alex Boxall’s Aaron has the Kray thing down to a tee, from the slicked back hair to starched white collars, James Ferguson’s Matty has Aaron up on a pedestal. And it is this power imbalance that creates the play’s most interesting textures as Aaron manipulates Matty’s obvious desire for him and Matty just laps it up until…until…."

376,376,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2013,Ian,Darling of the Day, Union,"The fear with shows that are receiving their UK premieres some 45 years after an abbreviated Broadway run is that there is a good reason that they have continued to languish in obscurity. But London’s fringe theatres have a good record in sorting through the duds to unearth some genuine neglected treasures and chief on the musical side, is the Union Theatre. And it is there where director Paul Foster has returned, to put on Jule Styne’s Darling of the Day – which managed just the 31 performances on Broadway, wilting in the winds of change ushered in by its contemporary Hair – and whilst it may not emerge as a hugely revelatory success, it makes for an evening of gentle pleasures. Set in Edwardian times, the plot circles around Priam Farll, an artist of note who seizes the chance to escape the pressures of fame when his valet Henry Leek dies suddenly and a mistake by a doctor allows him to swap identities. Farll then rejoices in the freedom of living a less complicated life, which includes meeting up with working class Putney widow Alice Challice through the matrimonial agency both were using, and unexpectedly ends up in love and married. But times are tight and when a plot is hatched to bring in some extra money, it arouses the avaricious attentions of art collector Lady Vale and dealer Clive Oxford who threaten to expose the whole affair. Styne undoubtedly knew his way around a good tune and considered this amongst one of his best scores. And in several of the ensemble numbers, beautifully enlivened by Matt Flint’s choreography, there’s a charming vitality that really works whether poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, suggesting the close-knit world of this working-class community or just speaking of the pleasures of being an artist. Foster and designer Naomi Wright wisely keep the stage of the Union uncluttered, allowing the production to embrace the audience in its warmth. There’s no mistaking the tweeness present though and whilst this team work hard to keep it on the right side, its undemanding nature is always there. Having the central couple be somewhat older than the fresh-faced ingénues that usually front up such musical theatre fare is a refreshing change, especially when blessed with songs such as the gorgeous Let’s See What Happens. Katy Secombe imbues Alice with a amiability and emotional honesty that is a delight to watch but whilst James Dinsmore delivers Farll with an appropriate sheen of mannered professionalism as the man releasing the strictures of his upbringing, it felt he could have done more to really connect with Secombe’s Alice and give us the solid chemistry to believe in."
377,377,Ought To Be Clowns,06/06/2017,Ian,Common, National,"Over the past few years where he may or may not have been studying sculpture at Saint Martin’s College, Northampton-born playwright DC Moore has been putting together a résumé of quietly impressive work – exploring aspects of contemporary masculinity in insightful plays such as the excellent Straight and under-rated monologue Honest, or opening up his focus to the war in Afghanistan in The Empire and family dramas in The Swan. So news that he was making his main-stage debut at the National Theatre with Common, in a co-production with Headlong and starring no less than Anne-Marie Duff and Cush Jumbo, was bright news indeed.  But whilst I thought I wanted to do what other common people do, Moore has taken a completely different tack here. Common delves into the under-explored history of rural England in 1809 as the social and economic changes heralded by the Industrial Revolution begin to filter through the country. More crucially, his acute ear for sharply observed dialogue has been smothered by the invention of a fruitily rich mode of language full of compound words – described charitably by Jumbo as “a mixture of Shakespeare, Harry Potter and some kind of Angelina Jolie movie”. You can only wonder why, as the result is denser than the mud that covers the Olivier stage in Richard Hudson’s sparse, open design. The unwieldy nature of the words means it is hard to follow what is going on, who people actually are, why anything is really happening. The action is led by Duff’s Mary, a woman once left for dead by peasant leader King (John Dagleish) who has since made her fortune in the city, who has returned to her native countryside to wreak havoc on those who have wronged her and reclaim Jumbo’s Laura, the woman she loves, who just happens to be King’s sister. And whilst she wants to sleep with common people (again), Moore also piles on elements of folk horror, paganism, clairvoyance, agrarian reform, disembowelment, incest, talking crows and a big cuddly toy (only one of those is made up). But such ambition weighs heavily on the play and director Jeremy Herrin has not found a way to balance it all (though a tumultuous preview period suggests that this production could develop yet further). Despite the epic scope of the writing and the epic scale of the production, too much of Common is flat and worse, it is dull. Short of calling your dad to stop it all, there are elements to admire. Duff has the kind of stage presence to almost pull the whole thing through, Wicker Man-like costumery creates an atmospheric edge, and Paule Constable’s lighting is masterful in the way in which it conjures the strangeness of the mood in the land here. And whether you consider it has worked or not, the boldness of the vision here, in the way in which Moore is stretching himself as a playwright cannot be underestimated. It’s just I can’t see anyone else smiling in here..     "
378,378,Ought To Be Clowns,15/05/2014,mag9l,The Pajama Game, Shaftesbury,"As is often the way, a canny bit of recasting ensured my need to revisit a show I’d already seen and resolved not to revisit. In this case, it was The Pajama Game, which I caught last year in Chichester when Joanna Riding and Hadley Fraser led Richard Eyre’s productions to great acclaim, which now arrives for a summer at the Shaftesbury Theatre with Michael Xavier taking over from Fraser. I am most fond indeed of Xavier’s work, and as I enjoyed the show in all its strangely charming old-fashioned oddity, going back wasn’t too much of a trial."
379,379,Ought To Be Clowns,07/02/2010,Ian,The Early Bird, Finborough,"The design by takis is sensational: the actors are enclosed in a clear perspex cube and surrounded by piles of ash, with just a toy chest inside. Lit harshly from fluorescent tubes below, it is clear they are trapped, both physically and emotionally in their horrific experience, but as the seats are arranged around the box in the round, it is clear that we the audience are also trapped, with nowhere to hide from the unfolding action and the unflinching, coruscating stares of the actors. Leo Butler’s language is dark and modern, making much use of echoing phrases and repeated sections as we discover new and changing meanings as the action progresses, but it must be said that even with just a 70 minute running time, some of the repetition did become a little bit wearing. This is in part due to the opaqueness of the writing. We are constantly having our understanding questioned with some really clever tricks pulling you one way or the other, but the nightmarish, almost hallucinatory, twists and turns means that one is still left questioning at the end of the play. The vagueness leaves one feeling somewhat unfulfilled although makes for very interesting post-show discussion. Cusack and Palmer both give strong, impassioned performances, filled with anger they both convince, in the quieter moments there’s perhaps less of an emotional connecton between them, and between them and the audience, but this is as much to do with the above-mentioned vagueness: it’s hard to care for someone when you don’t know if they exist or what is really going on. Just finally, there are scenes where they both double up as their daughter, these are amongst the most chilling things I have ever seen. The vocal effect alone was creepy enough, but the physical performances in playing Kimberley, especially by Palmer, is still giving me the chills thinking about it now. Whilst by no means perfect, this is such an interesting production with much to commend it, and with limited seating inside, I rather suspect it will sell out soon, so book now. But be warned, uncompromising and brutal, this is not theatre for the faint-hearted! Yes, I found this difficult and ambiguous, too. I hate being watched in the theatre, so having Cusack stare me down was deeply unsettling. I too thought the doubling up was particularly chilling, especially Ryan (it is Ryan, isn't it? I'm sure the bio said it was that rather than Palmer). The staring was indeed unsettling, I didn't quite know how to react to it, but I think I actually liked the challenge to responding directly to the performers, having to make up your mind then and there whether you believed them or not and thereby giving the appropriate response.I didn't actually pick up a programme but the Finborough website says Palmer. (Does't he look like Rob Brydon though!) I think it's just that I don't like being challenged like that, or being picked out, even though they were doing it to everyone. I like being anonymous in the middle of a theatre group, I only 'do' audience participation reluctantly or when drunk and brave. I'm assuming you're a little braver than I am? Ah, you're right, I have no idea why I thought it was Ryan but nobody picked up on it. What a twit."

London: Four Corners One Heart is a collection of “stories inspired by the streets of London and the people who play on them”, all short pieces of new writing from emerging playwrights. The theme is London in all its variety and the four stories each take a corner, a point on the compass to talk about the city they love. There was much to admire about the whole production, not least the ambitious scope of producers Sky or the Bird, the gusto of the cast and creatives and the supportive atmosphere of an enthusiastic audience. And though I have to be honest and say the quality of the evening was sometimes variable, I found much to appreciate too, especially in the stimulation of young writing talent. My favourite piece of the evening was probably Lashana Lynch’s Crossword, representing the West. Definitely the best acted, by Ayesha Antoine and Michael Salami, it sparkled with a joyous playfulness as people of different heritage who realise they have more in common than they realise as they begin to flirt with each other. But it also speaks of a deeper intelligence as Lynch probes what it is really like to be a multi-cultural person living in an ostensibly multi-cultural society and director Jane Jeffrey astutely weaves in poignant moments alongside the comedy to showcase Lynch’s work beautifully. Elsewhere, Benjamin Askew’s ambitiously poetic South London-based Doggy style: a Fairy Tale of One Tree Hill proved a quirkily effective opener. Simon Norbury, Heather Saunders and Oliver Gomm handling the imaginatively drawn tale of reality kicking into life and dispelling notions of romance and magic really very well. Mike Mersea’s Transits, a north London tale of a tentative father-daughter reconciliation via a photography project, wasn’t quite invested with enough emotional honesty – by the writer or by the actor – to escape the tweeness of the concept. And Rose Lewenstein’s East: A Hundred Different Worlds, possibly the most ambitious of the pieces of writing, felt like the one with the furthest to go: her intertwining of three narratives on a council estate lacked the necessary interconnectedness to become more than just an academic exercise and pull us into the heart and soul of the stories."
381,381,Ought To Be Clowns,21/10/2010,Ian,Men Should Weep, National Theatre,"Men Should Weep is a play by Ena Lamont Stewart, voted as one of the top 100 English language plays of the twentieth century but has been very rarely performed. A programme note suggests that it was O H Mavor’s dismissal of her talent that prevented her from developing further as a playwright and stifling her reputation and it was crushingly sad to find out that the real appreciation of her work as a classic and its placing in said poll came too late for her as her memory had gone by then and she passed away in 2006. So this is an important revival in that sense, spearheaded by Artistic Director of the Bush Theatre Josie Rourke’s directorial debut at the National, but in its look at the everyday life of people in poverty, it rings with an ominous political resonance given the news in yesterday’s Comprehensive Spending Review and the effect it will have on the poorest in our society. This was the third preview, so all the usual caveats apply. Set in the 1930s, the impoverished years of the Great Depression, in the crowded working-class slums of the Gorbals in the East End of Glasgow, it follows one family’s struggle for survival in a tough world. Working mother of seven Maggie is the lynchpin of this family but has to deal with an unemployed husband who won’t demean himself to do any domestic work, the return of a troublesome son and his wife to an already over-crowded home, one child with TB, another longing to fly to family coop and a gaggle of over-bearing friends and neighbours. Depressing as it might sound, it actually proves to be quite an uplifting affair. The focus is more on the ways in which people survive rather than the sheer awfulness of their life and so there’s actually quite a lot of comedy in here, people using humour to get through the day no matter how grim it may seem. And so gender roles are discussed with a resigned acceptance that they’ll never change, the trials of bringing up children of all ages are endlessly dissected and the importance of a strong sense of community is never under-estimated. As Maggie, Sharon Small is excellent at showing how then, and even so now, it is women who bear the brunt of holding families and households together in times of extreme poverty, with a performance of great dignity which only cracks under great duress in a truly moving scene where she finally snaps. Her relationship with Robert Cavanah’s John is very well observed too, she’s careful to avoid every little thing that might set him off, but there’s a real tenderness in their love for each other which endures even through his pained feeling of emasculation at not being able to provide for his family. Cavanah is good but I felt he could afford to go a little bit darker with his characterisation given his circumstances. The canniest casting though is in the neighbours and in particular in securing Karen Dunbar, one of Scotland’s funniest comedians, as Mrs Harris. What this play carefully shows is the importance of the social network that these women formed in their domestic lives: they might not like each other but they respect and need the support that is offered by others going through the same situation and I enjoyed this play the most when it was these women sat round the kitchen table, chewing the fat. Dunbar is excellent as is Isabelle Joss, but special mention too has to go to Louise Montgomery, thrown in at the deep end as an understudy for the indisposed Jayne McKenna as Maggie’s loving (if a little preachy) sister Lily. Elsewhere, I enjoyed Morven Christie’s coldly manipulative Isa, Anne Downie’s as the ever-grumbling but sweetly funny Granny and Sarah MacRae’s Jenny whose bolshiness and personal drive ends up pointing towards a brighter future. Bunny Christie’s design is a startling effective and realistic representation of a tenement building, complete with staircase that leads both up and down from the letterbox perspective that is used to focus in on the Morrisons’ apartment. What this also allows is slices of all the surrounding flats to be viewed throughout the play as well, giving occasional glimpses into the lives carrying on around our central family whether it is eavesdropping, domestic violence or simply making the dinner. It is a nice trick and for once, missing out on the cheaper seats and having to fork out for a centre stalls seat in the middle of the Lyttelton proved to be a boon as I think you’d actually miss a fair bit from the front few rows. Michael Bruce provides a lovely jaunty jazz-inflected soundtrack but whilst James Farncombe’s lighting is mostly nicely atmospheric, I think it’s a shame that they had to go the step further and add one particular effect which isn’t really necessary and put me more in mind of Celebrity Squares than anything. Lamont Stewart wrote the play as a direct attempt to get the experience of the working classes in the voice of the working classes onto the stage and so it performed in period Glasgow dialect and the mostly Scottish company have the accent down to a t. As an alumnus of the University of Glesga, I had little problem understanding the actors and none of the dialect is so impenetrable that it is hard to work out what they are referring to, but it is something to be aware of. The American couple next to us felt like they were missing some of the nuances of the humour and I had to translate a few words for them. Perhaps a wee glossary of some the key terms could have been included in the programme but I don’t think the dialogue should be tampered with too much before opening night as it seriously runs the risk of losing its authenticity. So an interesting, and important, piece of programming, offering a chance to see a neglected piece of quality work with a strong ensemble. And as a piece of social realism, its timing is eerily apposite: “I dinnae ken whit those old buggers in parliament are doing wit mah money”. I think that ""letterbox"" set design must be a bit deceptive because I *was* in the cheap seats at the front and was thinking the same thing: ""Well *I* can see that stuff's going on because I can look up underneath the curtain and see the upstairs, but surely if you were half a dozen rows behind me you'd barely see their feet?"" Interesting, its so dependent on where your seats are. I didn't even know there was another level downstairs that you could see until I read about it somewhere else!"
382,382,Ought To Be Clowns,22/11/2014,Ian,Girlfriends, Union,"The Howard Goodall season at the Union Theatre, soon to move to new premises, has been one of its more enterprising moves in recent times. Love Story and the dreaming both had their moments but the third piece in the trilogy – Girlfriends – feels like the weakest of the lot. Bronagh Lagan’s production can’t do much to disguise the reasons that the show was a commercial flop on its 1987 debut but also adds its own complications with a truly unnecessarily awkward staging choice – how this wasn’t picked up on earlier on is baffling. The show itself suffers from promising one thing – looking at the experience of working women in the Second World War – and delivering another – the romantic travails of two of them. The company is even split 10 to 2, women to men, and yet the focus settles firmly on this pair of love stories to the severe detriment of many of the supporting characters who remain scarcely sketched caricatures. That three men collaborated on the book – Richard Curtis and John Retellack along with Goodall – might be part of the problem. That this story is then told with such a physically narrow focus feels like a frustrating misjudgement. Nick Corrall’s design spreads long and wide against one side but Lagan and Iona Holland’s choreography are firmly centred in a small area which pays no attention to about half, if not more, of the audience. So it’s hard to pass judgement on what could have been excellent performances from Corinne Priest and Perry Lambert as the main women, and Catherine Mort and Catriana Sandison as two of their colleagues, since it rarely felt like we were being included."
383,383,Ought To Be Clowns,25/02/2019,Ian,Tacenda, VAULT Festival,"With my Susie Dent hat on, “tacenda is an archaic term referring to things better left unsaid; the opposite of ‘agenda'”. With the hat off, Tacenda is also the name of RedBellyBlack’s new show devised deviously for the VAULT Festival in their inimitable mix of physical theatre, storytelling and sequins and gold lamé jackets. Elizabeth and Joy have been friends for a long time but things are becoming highly strained as Joy has moved in while looking for a new place to live and Elizabeth is newly single and both are having problems at work. On the day of their best friend Joel’s 30th birthday party, communication becomes so bad that the universe makes them do over the day until they finally start being honest with each other, and with themselves. So far so Groundhog Day but there’s something more here too, something that speaks to the grinding treadmill that city life can be in its endless fruitless freelance pitches, the soul-crushing pain of flat hunting, cab drivers that won’t shut up, there not being enough hot water in the morning… These two women may be living the same day over and over but it is one that it is innately recognisable and forces us to look at what this does to the way we are. For me, I’m not sure the movement sequences really added that much to the overall show, I wanted more of the deliciously dark brand of humour that flows each time we get to the party. Joel Gatehouse’s birthday boy is hilarious in each incarnation and I loved how far Louise Hoare and Kate Goodfellow were willing to go to cap off their monumentally bad day(s) (and I was quite glad not to be on the front row for once!)."
384,384,Ought To Be Clowns,13/07/2012,Ian,Play Without Words, Sadler’s Wells,"Inspired in 1960s British New Wave cinema, it borrows heavily from the 1963 Harold Pinter-scripted The Servant to tell of a well-to-do young man who hires a manservant to run his household but who ends up controlling his life. But what Bourne has done is to double- and sometimes triple-cast the characters so that the story is told with multiple perspectives and the varying possibilities of each scene are explored right in front of us. It’s a clever move and one which offers much opportunity but I couldn’t help but feel that by the end it was overused. In terms of pure storytelling, it left me feeling close to baffled at times, narrative clarity always comes second to dramatic effect in that respect. And from my simplistic point of view, it left the stage constantly overloaded, where had there been more variety in terms of the three-fold iteration being alternated with a single dancer for each character, might have provided a cleaner contrast and heightened the excitement of the larger scenes. Terry Davies’ heavily jazz-inflected score was a little too one-note for my liking as well, almost monotonous in its insistent presence yet providing little variety. That’s not to say that there weren’t aspects that I liked. Bourne’s choreography clearly defines character with great skill: the seductive maid, the uptight fiancée, the sexually voracious lurking man, it is clear throughout who these people are. And the two leading men, the calculating valet Prentice and the nerdily engaging Anthony as his employer, have a great chemistry as the balance of power shifts between them – the early dressing/undressing scene is excellently done – exemplified in the climactic subjugation of Anthony."
385,385,Ought To Be Clowns,04/05/2010,Ian,Sweet Charity, Theatre Royal Haymarket,"Last night’s trip to Sweet Charity at the Theatre Royal Haymarket (with Aunty Jean, for my birthday treat!) actually marks the first time that I have seen a show that has transferred from a small venue into the West End in both of its incarnations. My original review can be read here about Charity Hope Valentine’s romantic misadventures and her continued search for her dream man in the face of constant setbacks and dastardly lotharios, and much of what I loved about it then holds true now as it is still as excellent a show. Little has actually been changed about the production, everything is just a bit bigger really and the transitions a lot smoother, the only real difference was the fairground scene with Charity and Oscar and her vertigo where they make use of the more advanced facilities to sit on a suspended seat. Where the production does benefit from the transfer though is in the extra room for the choreography, Rich Man’s Frug and I’m A Brass Band in particular both luxuriate in the additional space offered by the Theatre Royal and Stephen Mears’ superb choreography has unfurled beautifully, maintaining the huge level of energy and vitality it pushes into the show. This is probably best exemplified in Hey, Big Spender, such a different number to the familiar Shirley Bassey version, the girls at the club sprawl over high stools, selling their wares half-heartedly with deliciously bored expressions, it is abundantly clear that this is no glamorous life and one can immediately see why Charity is so keen to escape. The cast is largely intact from the Menier production, all the principals remain the same but there’s been a couple of changes in the ensemble: Kenneth Avery-Clark, Matthew Barrow, Alexis Owen Hobbs Laura Scott and Joanna Goodwin (recently in Once Upon a Time at the Adelphi) have now been added, replacing a few originals, but the change has been done seamlessly and everyone was nicely, tightly drilled. I have to mention Annalisa Rossi’s scene-stealingly good Carmen though, she is hysterical with every single line as a stroppy dancer and her final dance with Herman is just brilliant. All of the lead performances were as good as I recalled, Mark Umbers’ beautifully natural voice expanded to fill the theatre most impressively, Josefina Gabrielle continued to make me fall in love with her, I could just watch her dance and sing for days and Tiffany Graves continues to give a strong performance, displaying great chemistry with both Gabrielle and Outhwaite, really selling numbers like Baby Dream Your Dream and There’s Gotta Be Something Better Than This with warmth behind the bawdy exterior. As for Tamzin Outhwaite, she continues to impress with her ever-hopeful Charity, never letting the mask of her smile drop until the final touching breakdown. Her singing and dancing fills the stage effortlessly and I hope we get more opportunities to see this lighter side of her in whatever she chooses to do next, she is really is such an engaging and charming performer. She is reportedly suffering from bronchitis and although one would not have known it at all from her performance, she did look absolutely shattered at the curtain call so I really hope she allows herself sufficient recovery time in order to be fully fit for the run (we saw the last preview, press night is on the 4th so I guess she’s wanted to continue in order to garner the good publicity conducive to an extended run). So if you were not lucky enough to see this at the Menier, I can heartily recommend it to you now. Full of exuberant performances, stunning choreography and a bagful of truly great tunes, this show really will guarantee you fun, laughs and such a good time. Love Gabrielle and Graves too, did you see them in Chicago together?"
386,386,Ought To Be Clowns,25/06/2018,Ian,Machinal, Almeida,"Sophie Treadwell’s 1928 play Machinal may be the story of one woman battling societal pressure but Natalie Abrahami’s production for the Almeida Theatre teases out a more elemental struggle, one which stretches over the majority of the twentieth century and by extension, even further. The story is rooted in its ordinariness. Emily Berrington’s Young Woman gets by at a job she doesn’t like, marries the first guy who shows an interest, gives birth to a child she scarcely wants – expectations check check checked. But as she learns that she wants more, can want more, the weight of societal pressure comes to bear. Through Treadwell’s episodic, Expressionist viewpoint, and further filtered through Abrahami’s lens, that pressure is slowly tightened like thumbscrews. Helen’s world is intermittently filled with oppressive noise, as often in the form of a torrent of words from her own mouth as not, and Ben and Max Ringham’s sound and composition ratchets up this intensity. Creatively, the production soars through the inventiveness of Miriam Buether’s set design. An angled mirror on the ceiling of its black box doubles down on our perspective as spectators. And the transitions between episodes are marked by the closing of giant shutters, facilitating the shift through the decades with a clinical smoothness."
387,387,Ought To Be Clowns,19/11/2017,Ian,Inside Pussy Riot, Saatchi Gallery,"How far can immersive theatre push you? How far should immersive theatre push you? The disclaimer for Les Enfants Terribles’ Inside Pussy Riot warns us it is “not for the faint hearted, come prepared to demonstrate and stand up for what you believe in!”. But given that it is trying to give audiences a taste of what it is like to be on the wrong side of a totalitarian regime, from arrest to trial to incarceration with a bit of forced labour in there for good measure, there’s a limit to how far they can actually go. Marking the 100th annversary of the Russian Revolution, Inside Pussy Riot revisits the experience of Nadya Tolokonnikova and her post punk, feminist art collective colleagues in Pussy Riot, who were convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment for performing less than 40 seconds of an anti-Putin song in a Moscow cathedral. From the opening moments when you’re invited to pick a balaclava (a range of colours available) to the climactic encouragement to raise your voice in protest, there’s quite the journey ahead. One of the joys of immersive theatre, for me at least, is that sense of being encouraged to do or experience things I haven’t done before (my first You Me Bum Bum Train will forever be one of my all-time favourite memories for just that reason) and in its opening sequence, Inside Pussy Riot managed two searching moments of real, arresting power that cleverly upended what I thought was going to be happening. As authoritarian figures loom and bark orders, there’s a definite feel of falling down a twisted rabbit hole – so far so Kafka."
388,388,Ought To Be Clowns,06/12/2019,Ian,Gypsy, Royal Exchange,"The choice of the festive musical is a big one for many a venue, and they don’t come much bigger than Broadway classic Gypsy, which director Jo Davies has tackled for the Royal Exchange (returning to Manchester after a really rather excellent Twelfth Night). It also feels a bit of a bold choice given that the shadow of Imelda Staunton looms large for many, though that was over four years ago now. And if we consider Mama Rose to be the ne plus ultra of female MT roles, well you rarely hear people complaining about the endless succession of Hamlets and Lears, so it is more than time for a new Rose to bloom. Davies gets a lot right, particularly in terms of her collaborators. Andrew Wright’s choreography makes considered use of the space, brilliantly exploiting the intimacy of being in the round (this is definitely a show to splash out on stalls seats for) as Leo Munby’s musical direction delivers a bright, if fairly traditional rendition of Jule Styne’s iconic score. The bulb-bright flashes of Colin Grenfell’s lighting are showstoppingly effective throughout, particularly when allied with the mobile rig that dominates Francis O’Connor’s set. The sequence where ghosts of the past come to bear witness to a crucial decision by Rose is stunningly, hauntingly effective.   And onstage, there’s an embarrassment of riches tackling Arthur Laurents’ ferociously written book. Rebecca Thornhill, Suzie Chard and Kate O’Donnell are terrific as they deliver a hilariously rough-edged take on ‘You’ve Gotta Get A Gimmick’, Dale Rapley is dishy sweetness personified as the long-suffering Herbie and Louis Gaunt dances like a dream as ne’er-do-well Tulsa. Melissa James essays Louise’s transformative journey with real physical prowess too – she seriously seems to grow a foot in height as well as in confidence as she finally gets the chance to step into the limelight that has been so long denied to her, no matter the cost."
389,389,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2019,Ian,Mites / Dutchman, Tristan Bates Theatre,"The publicity for James Mannion’s new play Mites ricochets between psychological thriller and bleakly absurdist comedy and it is a tension that epitomises much of the whole experience. In a world of mysterious workmen, anthropomorphic cats and talking dust mites, the playwright also seeks to situate a serious discussion about mental health and domestic abuse, a combination which ultimately satisfies on neither front. Claire Marie Hall’s Ruth is at the centre here, an unreliable narrator of sorts as we try to ascertain whether we’re in the realm of fantasy or cold hard reality. A pest controller arrives and declares he is her missing husband returned to her. Her cat isn’t so sure and tells her so. The layers of confusion work insofar as challenging assumptions about mental health and the frequent shakiness of the grip we want to show the world we have.   And if Mannion had doubled down on the absurdist side, as a crucial scene midway through seems to suggest he will, Mites might have hung together much more satisfactorily. Instead, there’s a shift to a feminist revenge thriller which feels unearned, unexplored and thus cheap. George Howard and Richard Henderson do well as the male figures around Ruth but Marcus Marsh’s direction doesn’t do enough to make a convincing, cohesive whole. More successful at the Tristan Bates Theatre right now is a revival of Amiri Baraka’s civil rights era play Dutchman. Hallucinatory and challenging, it has lost none of its power to speak to race relations today, evoking thoughts of the treatment of any number of public figures of colour against whom hurricanes of torment are whipped up by the callous evil of media bosses and breakfast TV presenters."
390,390,Ought To Be Clowns,10/11/2010,Ian,An Ideal Husband, Vaudeville,"On the surface, Wilde’s play is the saga of a rising political star, Sir Robert Chiltern, whose career is threatened by the villainous Mrs Cleveley who is possession of the knowledge of the past indiscretion which led to him securing a small fortune and the undying respect of his virtuous wife. Mrs Cleveley wants his support on a new scheme and is willing to blackmail him to get her way, but when his wife Gertrude finds out the truth, her perfect ‘ideal husband’ is besmirched, she declares she can no longer love him and it is left to their dear friend Lord Arthur Goring. But on closer examination, it is becomes a passionate plea for true love to be willing to forgive everything, something given extra poignancy when one considers that Wilde’s affair with Lord Alfred Douglas would become public and wreck his life within the very year this play was first produced. In asking the audience to sympathise so heavily with a politician, guilty of corruption and unrepentant about it, there’s a curious sense of timing in this revival but Wilde’s customary witticisms and sharp observations carry us with him. And ultimately, it is hard to rebuff his rejection of the pursuit of perfection in lieu of a more worldly understanding of the way things work and compromising a bit. It really is a very funny play at times as one might expect, but more so than ever, one does come away wishing that the straight characters were as much fun as the more rakish ones. Consequently, the evening belongs to Samantha Bond and Elliot Cowan. As the devious Mrs Cheveley, she wields a deadly rapier intent wrapped in a velvet veneer of Victorian elegance with a highly amoral but dazzling turn, reminding us too of the woman behind the villain whose face crumples when ultimately rejected again by Goring. And Cowan is delightful as the would-be rake Arthur Goring whose wisecracking and debonair charms cannot disguise the depths of his relationship with the Chilterns and the honourable lengths he will go to to defend his friends using his practicality and strong humanity. Their scenes together crackle with electricity and Rachael Stirling impressed me with a nicely anguished performance of the rigidly certain Gertrude, bringing some much-needed empathy to an full of nuances and proving that she really is a superb reactive actress: her facial expressions are always a joy to watch, particularly so in the final act as her husband grills Goring and edges closer to the truth. Against these three though, Alexander Hanson’s Lord Chiltern was a bit disappointing, a wan portrayal which was underpowered with little depth suggested so that when his explosive shouty angst finally emerged, it felt very much out of place. Of the more minor players, standout Charles Kay is the most fun as the Earl of Caversham with his constant hectoring of his son Goring to get married and I enjoyed Fiona Button’s gauchely charming Mabel. Stephen Brimson Lewis’ design is gorgeously opulent: based around an octagonal stage, the Chilterns’ residence is all burnished gold panels with a range of nice add-ons, Goring’s is a beautiful deep turquoise and so the accompanying minimum of furnishings works well in keeping the space uncluttered. And the costumes match up to the design with some absolutely stunning frockage, my favourites were Bond’s opening peacock blue gown and Stirling’s tweedy tailored number but not letting the side down for the men is Cowan’s utterly eye-catching maroon suit in the final act. It feels ungentlemanly to say it, but the choice to cast Bond and Stirling as contemporaries is a difficult one at best. Bond is beautifully made up and Stirling is kept relatively dowdy but there is no disguising the 16 year age gap between them and when Mrs Clevely talks of remembering Lady Chiltern from school, one can hear the barely suppressed ‘really?!’ from the audience. And given that this was a preview, I was inclined to forgive the stiltedness with which much of the first act proceeded but as the final one, there’s only a wee while in order to rectify it and ensure every last actor is on top of their lines. Ultimately though, I really enjoyed this production of An Ideal Husband. It is just gorgeous to look at, rewarding to listen to and laugh with and in Cowan and Bond, there’s two hugely enjoyable performances. I don't know if you saw the same night that I did (Tuesday 10th) but there was a shocking number of line flubs considering how close to opening they were. Caroline Blakiston in particular railroaded her way through her speech in quite shocking fashion.  I did enjoy the night but the first half was quite shaky on a number of fronts and given the ticket prices, a bit of a shocker. Elliot Cowan is the best thing by far in this. 😉 What a waste of £50 🙁"

392,392,Ought To Be Clowns,11/02/2019,Ian,Sexy Lamp, VAULT Festival,"Katie Arnstein’s Bicycles and Fish was one of the highlights of last year’s VAULT festival for me, so I couldn’t but approach her new show Sexy Lamp  with just a touch of raised expectations. So it is with pleasure that I can report I gave my first standing o of this year, accompanied by many others (in fact, the first I’ve seen at the VAULT so far). Arnstein’s style is of the deceptively gentle confessional. She’ll lure you in with Love Actually-style handwritten signs, catchy tunes from her ukulele and a wonderfully wry sense of humour. But then she’ll clobber you over the head with searingly honest insight and brutal anecdotal evidence from the front line – in this case, of trying to become an actor in an industry that too often leaves women interchangeable with, well, sexy lamps. There’s something beguilingly wonderful about the way Arnstein crafts her words, the beauty in lyrics like “there’s a twinkle in the London Eye”. But its her social critiques that really hit home. No one is left unscathed from her sweetly savage takedowns – morning joggers, men who own boats, fellow actors, children in her audiences who dare voice opinions…but she slides the dagger in and out so smilingly quickly that you’d probably say thank you for the privilege. But there’s deadly serious intent here too, a forthright plea to recognise that whilst many of us may only have been using the #MeToo hashtag for a year, people have been living the #MeToo experience for years. And as Katie recounts the many micro-aggressions that accompany being an aspiring actor, she shows how easily they metastastise into greater and more forceful crimes as those in positions of power seek to abuse that power to exploit, humiliate, even assault."
393,393,Ought To Be Clowns,01/12/2012,Ian,Pack, Finborough,"The Papatango New Writing Festival came up with an absolute cracker in Dawn King’s Foxfinder which sold out the Finborough last winter, so it is fair to say that expectations for this year’s winner – Louise Monaghan’s Pack – are fairly high. It is an entirely different beast though and one which seems eerily well-timed as the events around the recent Rotherham by-election played out, as this is an unflinchingly raw take on racism in a different part of Yorkshire and how it has permeated our society in ways which don’t always readily manifest themselves. Monaghan’s framing device is a bridge class at a community centre which brings working class mothers Stephie and Deb under the tutelage of Dianna, a maths teacher at the nearby high school, and they are joined by local GP Nasreen to make up the quartet. They’re a diverse group and throughout the smattering of techniques that we see them learn for this card game, the real interest comes in the tentative common ground that they find in the snippets of conversation inbetween. They discuss the husbands that they tolerate, the ageing parents that they care for, the children that they are trying to nurture, but against the febrile atmosphere of a looming British National Party rally, their lives become inextricably entangled with each other. It is compellingly performed in Olivia Alteras’ hyper-real set, Sarah Smart gives an incredibly nuanced performance as the naive Stephie, initially all comic inarticulacy but gravitating to a substantial emotional power as horizons darken; Angela Lonsdale’s sparky and spiky Deb holds a brittle shell around her for fear of revealing the raw emotion beneath and Amita Dhiri brings a remarkable stillness to Nasreen, her composure clearly her coping mechanism in a difficult world. Denise Black does very well to bring a depth of character to the comparatively underwritten Dianna, whose presence in the play isn’t always as well-calibrated as it could be by Monaghan."
394,394,Ought To Be Clowns,09/02/2019,Ian,A Wake in Progress, VAULT Festival,"This is the story of Henry. Except it won’t be when you see A Wake in Progress, as the finer details of this Fine Mess & Leila Sykes production are improvised every night, using audience suggestions to shape the action and flesh out back stories around a young person diagnosed with a terminal illness and given just months to live. Joel Samuels’ script sees our protagonist opting to stop treatment and get on with the business of living the life that remains, and some of the more powerful moments here come in the interactions with loved ones and family who can’t comprehend such a choice. There’s also some pretty punchy stuff around the language of death, our tendency towards euphemism instead of facing the truth head on. As these scenes play out, a narrator dips in and out, asking for answers to seemingly innocuous questions, the details of which are then elegantly wound into the action. It’s interactive theatre at its canniest, gently encouraging participation and then using the material to provide moments of lightness in what is otherwise deeply serious and occasionally, profoundly moving. "
395,395,Ought To Be Clowns,01/03/2019,Ian,Lipstick: A Fairy Tale of Iran, Omnibus Theatre,"There’s no lack of ambition here, not at all. Sarah Chew (writer and director) slips between Tehran, Derry and London as she explores cultural stereotyping, censorship, artistic freedom, sexual freedom, Iranian politics, Soho politics and even then I feel like I’ve missed tons out. Packed into a show which wants to blend cabaret and theatre, it just feels like too much. So much insight in suffused into Chew’s script, based on her own experiences travelling to Iran, and delivered by Siobhan O’Kelly’s Orla, it is full of deeply compelling details as she discovers the richness of life there, something so many media portrayals fail (or refuse) to show as they seek to shape our opinions. Tacked onto this, is Orla’s subsequent attempts to open a Soho drag bar with pal Mark (played by Nathan Kiley aka Topsie Redfern), as her journey of self-discovery forces her to reassess everything. It is a lot to ask and I’m not sure the play doesn’t buckle under the weight, leaving me somewhat unsatisfied."
396,396,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2014,Ian,James III – The True Mirror (plus overview of the trilogy), National Theatre,"If the world of James III – The True Mirror is what Scottish independence might have actually looked like, then I reckon the Yeses might have had it. Pithy remark aside, the costume work is spectacular here, conjuring up a modern classic look for the Scots that is to die for and which also serves as a visual cue into this production, the final of Rona Munro’s James Plays which abandons its medieval setting for this notional updating. Seeing it as the final part of the marathon trilogy day, it was a brilliant shift in tone and the pre-show entertainment (simply not to be missed) just adds to the sparkling invention as pop songs get the ceilidh treatment from Alasdair MacRae. Though the play may be entitled James III, the reality is that this slice of the Stewart monarchy was indubitably shared with his wife Margaret of Denmark. The third king of his name was a capricious fellow indeed, the self-confessed “sparkle before the dark”, a rebellious dandy concerned far more with the trappings of monarchy than the minutiae of ruling, most amusingly evidenced by his procurement of a choir to accompany him at all times. By contrast, his pragmatic wife (“from a rational nation with reasonable people” lest you forget!) looks after the treasury, pets the furrowed brow of the privy council and generally rules the roost. Of course she does, she’s Sarah Lund! What is truly remarkable about Sofie Gråbøl’s performance though is that you’d hardly know it. She’s a hugely attractive stage presence, warm and funny as an initially tolerant spouse but growing beautifully in stature as she seizes matters into her own hands. The play’s best scene comes with the gift of a new-fangled gift from Venice called a ‘mirror’, granting most everyone who looks in it the first ever glimpse of themselves and her reaction to her reflection is just gorgeous to behold, the kind of scene that budding actresses should have in their back pocket for auditions. With Blythe Duff’s dowager Princess Annabella and Rona Morison’s sparky Phemy in generous support, the Queen’s court is a vibrant place to be. That said, Jamie Sives makes James III enjoyably brattish, especially when in the midst of his adoring coterie – tasting wine with Andrew Rothney’s Cochrane is wittily done, taking advantage of Mark Rowley’s Ramsey adds a real frisson. Munro ensures that the recurring theme of what power does to a man is engagingly and differently explored and appropriately for the end of the epic sweep of the trilogy, the final notes resonate strongly with the debates that have dominated Scotland in recent months. Seeing all three plays on the same day was a real pleasure, a scandalous luxury to be sure (especially midweek) but a genuinely theatrical event of which I was glad to have been a little part. Being able to draw the narrative lines through nearly a century’s worth of history and get that sense of continuity of character really added to the experience, plus seeing a company working so hard and so creatively together has its own special thrill. Individual performance awards would probably go to James McArdle, Jamie Sives and Sofie Gråbøl but taking the wider view, Blythe Duff and Mark Rowley won the day for me with their always excellent work across all three."
397,397,Ought To Be Clowns,04/10/2014,Ian,Here Lies Love, National Theatre,"It’s not often I leave a play with penis envy – giant golden cock hat envy to be precise – but that’s how I felt leaving the newly-opened Dorfman Theatre (the National’s Cottesloe getting a much needed facelift) after the blisteringly good fun of Here Lies Love. (I also felt sad that I didn’t get a glowstick, it was only later I realised they weren’t being handed out to all and sundry.) But by and large, the abiding feeling was one of huge exhilaration, akin to the endorphin rush of a good night’s clubbing, for if you’ve booked correctly, that’s what you get here. You can sit down to see the show, the tiered seating of the theatre remains intact, but the real route into Alex Timber’s ingeniously immersive production is by getting a dancefloor ticket, whereby one is thrust right into the midst of this utterly idiosyncratic musical which tells of the rise and fall of Imelda Marcos, former First Lady of the Philippines entirely through the medium of dance music from David Byrne and Fatboy Slim. It is so thoroughly audacious a concept that it is hard to fathom how it even came into being, never mind emerge as the huge success it is here. For I loved it, immensely. Encouraged to dance along and throw out a routine or two by Martin Sarreal’s effervescent DJ, moving around the floor with the inventive parts of David Korins’ set design, avoiding being on camera with President Marcos, melting with joy as Imelda took my hand, there’s so much fun to be had in getting so close to the action that I can’t imagine sitting like a regular for it (though I appreciate it’s not for everyone, I’d’ve just been jealous if I was watching unable to join in). It also serves a genuine purpose in getting you swept up in the intoxicating allure of the Marcos’ world. And that’s what lies at the heart of the show for this is no dry biography – people searching for crystal-clear narrative are better off reading a book about it – but rather a sensory experience. Lyrics are taken from a variety of found sources but speak with enough clarity that no knowledge of Filipino history is strictly necessary, and the music swings and shakes and eventually shocks and stirs with a real vibrancy. Natalie Mendoza’s hugely charismatic Imelda, a pageant queen who makes good, weds famous man, is an amazing central figure who clearly deserves more of an epitaph than shoes, shoes, shoes. Byrne refrains from weighting the material too much one way or the other so there’s little judgement inherent in the piece. We get to see just how her relationships from her past panned out though – Dean John-Wilson’s suave former lover Ninoy Aquino and Gia Macuja Atchison as the woman who raised her Estrella Cumpas both deliver fantastic performances. And witness how her love of disco infected so much of her life (a trip to the club scene in New York brings out those golden phalluses) and how this seductive lure of power warped her mindset, the cry of ‘Why Don’t Love Me’ is brilliantly, naively sincere."
398,398,Ought To Be Clowns,23/09/2019,Ian,Outwitting the Devil / Heartbeat of Home,,"On the precipice of retirement, Khan has decided to focus his considerable talent (Binoche! Kylie!) on choreography, “dancing [his] ideas through the bodies of others” as he so eloquently puts it and the first fruit of this stage of his career is Outwitting the Devil. Inspired by a fragment from the 4,000 year old Epic of Gilgamesh, it is a powerfully evocative if thematically vague piece for six dancers and while I found it largely very impressive, I was grateful to have programme notes to give it some narrative structure. Not that I needed to be told exactly what it was ‘about’, but more about giving context to deepen the texture of the work onstage. For what Outwitting… does brilliantly is meld the differing styles of the individual performers – traditional Asian rubs shoulders directly with contemporary and hip-hop-influenced moves – with Khan’s own Kathak-inspired aesthetic to create something hypnotically, kinetically compelling. Incorporating dancers of different ages also layers in real interest in its complementary contrast and often breath-taking sequences. Like many people, I suspect, I quite like a bit of Riverdance but I don’t know if I could eat a whole one. And perhaps cognisant of this, one of the key braind behind it – John McColgan – has further developed the brand, its latest iteration being the perky Heartbeat of Home, resident at the Piccadilly Theatre for a few weeks. Blending Irish dancing with dance styles from across the globe, it’s a canny move and one which eventually pays off.  Based heavily (and unsurprisingly) on the theme of home, the first act has a little too much reliance on conventional notions of just what that is, veering dangerously close to stereotype as each ‘tribe’ does their own thing. The black dancers’ home is deemed to be non-specific Africa, the white people are obviously from Ireland…"
399,399,Ought To Be Clowns,30/10/2013,Ian,As You Like It, RSC at Theatre Royal Newcastle,"As You Like It is one of those plays that I find hard to get too excited about since I feel like I’ve seen it a hundred times. And Maria Aberg’s production for the RSC came with the additional baggage of over-enthusiastic acclaim from certain quarters that usually leave me sceptical but when in Newcastle the same week as the RSC… As suspected, the Laura Marling soundtrack riled me, its folks stylings seeming somewhat faux for a reason I can’t really articulate without resorting to calling it smug. But in Pippa Nixon, it has a truly excellent Rosalind. Set in a Glastonbury-inspired Forest of Arden, Nixon is startling as a genuinely androgynous figure once transformed, making the scenes with Alex Waldmann’s Orlando a thrilling experience in its gender-questioning ardour. And she’s a compelling presence throughout whether battling her fierce father or coaching her would-be lover in the school of romance. It all builds into a touching finale of nuptial bliss, which eventually wore down most of my scepticism, but I’m not entirely convinced that the setting works so well elsewhere."

401,401,Ought To Be Clowns,13/06/2010,Ian,Women, Power and Politics: Now,"Women, Power and Politics: Now is one half of a larger programme of activities by the Tricycle looking at the role of women in power and politics to try and find an answer to the persistent under-representation of women in the corridors of power in the UK. Taking its example from last year’s The Great Game, a number of playwrights have been commissioned to create short plays from a range of perspectives and stories and performed by a large ensemble of 12. This half looks at things from a modern perspective whereas Then takes a set of historical viewpoints, you should note the two evenings can be enjoyed separately and do not have to be viewed in chronological order. Directed by Indhu Rubasingham, Now features five short plays, Acting Leader by Joy Wilkinson, The Panel by Zinnie Harris, Playing the Game by Bola Agbaje, Pink by Sam Holcroft and You, Me and Wii by Sue Townsend, fuller reviews of each play can be read by clicking on the links in the titles. There’s a number of common themes that emerge from the evening, in particular the rise of the pursuit of individual gain over the collective good and the prevalence of voter apathy for a range of reasons. We also get a set of edited verbatim accounts from interviews with leading politicians conducted by Gillian Slovo, tonight you get Edwina Currie, Ann Widdecombe, Jacqui Smith, Oona King and Nick Clegg’s thoughts on issues affecting women in Westminster, read by a selection of the actors, Claire Cox’s Currie is the most entertaining here. The most illuminating though were the comments about Jacqui Smith’s choice of outfit for her opening speech as Home Secretary, totally unexpected to me and highly informative on the choices and decisions that people have made to get where they have. Rosa Maggiora set design and Matthew Eagland’s lighting is remarkably flexible, two movable walls evoking a vast range of locations with a minimum of fuss and all of the plays are impeccably acted by the hard-working ensemble. Stand-outs are Claire Cox who demonstrates a wide flexibility in the range of roles she covers and Heather Craney who brings a fierce intensity to both of her major roles. Lara Rossi and John Hollingworth also rate special mention here, but there’s quality throughout."
402,402,Ought To Be Clowns,17/11/2014,Ian,Piranha Heights, Old Red Lion,"South of the river, Philip Ridley’s natural home is the Southwark Playhouse but up north, it is the Old Red Lion that has proved an ideal fit as a series of revivals there continues with Piranha Heights. The warped uniqueness of his apocalyptic worldview is well suited to the claustrophobic intimacy that can be generated in this Angel pub theatre, under the new artistic directorship of Stewart Pringle, and this D.E.M. Productions take on this 2008 play is no exception. There’s anger here, elemental fury that literally shakes the walls of Cécile Trémolières’ inventive set as the responsibilities that one generation owes to the next are explored and exploded, and repeated as the next ones come along. The impact of parental legacies – both emotional in the psychological damage they can inflict, and physical in the passing on of property and effects – make this a fantastical yet gripping theatrical experience under Max Barton’s direction. Terry and Alan gather at their dead mother’s flat but soon fall into old patterns of bombastic brotherly behaviour as they battle over who gets the place – Alan wants to install himself and his troubled son Garth to make up for missing most of his childhood, but Terry has already invited the young squatters from down the hall. His bullying dominance over Alan is shaken when his invitees arrive and reveal how they in turn have been fucked up by his own generation."
403,403,Ought To Be Clowns,09/03/2010,Ian,You May Go Now – A Marriage Play, Finborough,"You May Go Now – A Marriage Play, written by US playwright Bekah Brunstetter takes up the Sunday/Monday slot at the Finborough theatre for the next three weeks, and is the first time that this play has been performed in Europe. Things open with Dottie teaching her daughter Betty how to be the perfect 1950s housewife, today’s lesson is baking and icing a cake. The kitchen set is carefully dressed with a great eye for period detail but it soon becomes clear that all is most definitely not what it seems under the surface. Betty has been a virtual prisoner, allowed no contact with the outside world, yet Dottie then throws her out into that world on her 18th birthday to find herself a husband. The next scene then flips the scenario on its head as Dottie becomes a modern-day woman, with a depressed husband, struggling to complete a novel: or does she? When Betty returns from the bus stop, and is followed by a mysterious boy called Phillip, it is clear things are about to change. It is darkly funny, with lots of sparky dialogue especially around the largely unaware Betty, and the story itself is engaging and suspenseful once one has gotten a handle on the wilfully obscure structure. But there were also elements that didn’t work: the hints of child abuse were most disconcerting but then swiftly abandoned and left unexplored. And it was never apparent to me why Dottie was trying to get rid of Betty in the first place, the act that sets up the whole play. As Dottie, Lucy Newman-Williams does a terrific job in navigating the wildly disparate elements of this woman, Stepford wife robotic intensity to modern-day novelist and bawith skill: the look of hurt on her face at the poorly iced cake was genius, Florence Hall’s Betty is sweetly angelic as the inquisitive naïf and then able stretch into a wider range of emotion as the truth of her situation slowly reveals itself, Michael Benz brings a youthful energy to the enigmatic Phillip, but Ryan Early is a bit miscast as Robert, looking too young and being dressed too old, and with an underwritten part, struggles to make much impact. >A space such as the Finborough is very unforgiving if there hasn’t been the utmost attention for detail and a couple of glaring errors did raise their head: for someone who had never even seen a computer before, Betty was able to navigate her way around a series of applications on the laptop within 30 seconds of sitting down and let’s just say someone is desperately in need of some target practice. Small things for sure, but they take you right out of the moment, and that is something this production can ill afford."
404,404,Ought To Be Clowns,10/07/2017,Ian,Queer Theatre – Neaptide, National,"“My God, I wanted three daughters like the Brontes and I ended up with a family fit for a Channel Four documentary” There was a special currency for Sarah Daniels’ Neaptide being the opening play in the #ntQueer season as this 1986 drama was actually the first by a living female playwright at the National Theatre – an astonishing fact all told. And it is perhaps sadly predictable that Daniels now finds herself somewhat neglected as a writer, despite being prolific in the 80s and 90s. Neaptide proved a strong choice too, a powerful exploration of the extent to which lesbian prejudice permeated society and institutions even as late as this, and indeed how little we’ve moved on – in some ways. Daniels presents us with three generations of lesbians and explores how they deal with working or studying at the same school when a scandal threatens to upturn all of their lives. Teacher Claire isn’t out but is involved in a bitter custody battle with her unscrupulous ex, the judgement from the court likely to be more favourable if the secret is kept, but the treatment of gay students at her school disquiets her, very much to her cost as it turns out. Jessica Raine was ideally cast as Claire, deeply empathetic and thoroughly invested in the role even from her chair. Maureen Beattie as her well-meaning mother got the lion’s share of the laughs and a superb Adjoa Andoh as Claire’s boss brought real stature to the reading, which you imagine Sarah Frankcom could well turn into a full production given the response it got here. Neaptide may show its age just a little but with its cutting humour and sharp insights, it was the perfect opener to this season.      Photos: James Bellorini Cast for the 1986 NT production directed by John Burgess

405,405,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Killer Joe, Trafalgar Studios,"Just to be clear, I’m using the ‘she’ in the quote above to refer to the play itself here – an misjudged, tone-deaf revival of Tracy Letts’ Killer Joe, a poor poor replacement for The Grinning Man at the Trafalgar Studios and a curious choice indeed for Orlando Bloom to make a return to the West End stage. Written in 1993 and marking Letts’ debut, it is a scorchingly nasty look at working-class American life, the desperation it forces some into, the impact that an unconstrained popular culture has on society. And whilst it may have resonated then, all that chimes now is a warning bell to keep the fuck away.  Chris is drowning in debt and decides that the only thing to do is to hire a hitman to kill his stepmother for the life insurance payout. He finds Killer Joe Cooper but his upfront fee is too much for them, so Chris’ brain-damaged sister Dottie is offered up as collateral. The collateral damage though spreads much further than just the world of this play. No-one is suggesting that scenes of ritual female humiliation are verboten (although I’m getting close) but as written here by a man and directed here by a man, they’re simply horrendous and exploitative. Not only that, for all the trumpeted equality of the nudity here, the brief flash of Bloom’s peachy cheeks is in no way comparable to the much more lingering scenes of female nudity. "
406,406,Ought To Be Clowns,08/11/2010,Ian,Company, Queens Theatre,"Last up in the programme of Stephen Sondheim celebration events from the Donmar Warehouse was a concert version of their 1995 production of Company. As with Merrily We Roll Along, last week’s offering, this show features music and lyrics by Sondheim and a book by George Furth with astonishingly bright musical direction from Gareth Valentine, but directed this time by Jamie Lloyd.  The show centres around Bobby, a single man struggling to deal with the realities of adult relationships, and the people around him, his three girlfriends and the five married couples who are his best friends. The show is presented as a set of short vignettes randomly scattered around Bobby’s 35th birthday rather than a linear plot which meant this performance didn’t really come across too well in the concert format especially compared to Merrily… Also, with a much larger cast or rather a greater division of songs amongst the cast, it did mean that there was some considerable variation in the performance level as opposed to the solidity provided by the leads last week. I have to admit to not being massively impressed by Adrian Lester as the central Robert, he just didn’t convince for me for whatever reason, though this didn’t seem to affect anyone else as the tears were definitely flowing as he reached the end of ‘Being Alive’. Haydn Gwynne impressed as Joanne, Sophie Thompson’s Amy was a whirlwind of overacting but delivered the incredibly verbose ‘Not Getting Married’ well, but it was Anna Francolini who impressed me the most, not least because she has worked so incredibly hard over the last couple of weeks participating in the two Merrily… shows last week as well as these two and playing eight shows a week in Onassis: the woman deserves a medal! I lost my programme somewhere on the way out, so I can’t be 100% sure of this but I think there were eight returning cast members from fourteen but I do recall that sadly, these shows were dedicated to the memory of Sheila Gish, the original Joanne, who passed away from cancer in 2005. All in all, Mr Sondheim ought to be rather impressed at the way in which London has celebrated his 80th birthday with huge gusto and a wave of productions all year long. I think I am thoroughly Sondheimed out now though, I was so very underwhelmed by Passion and despite the amazing casts for both these concerts and being truly grateful for the opportunity to hear some wonderful people sing, these events really were for the bona fide Sondheim cognoscenti rather than the casual observer. I loved this performance. I thought Adrian Lester's ""honest"" singing voice was quite charming and loved that it was not note perfect.  Sophie Thompson was so energetic, I loved her and I totally agree with you re Anna Francolini, what a woman! "
407,407,Ought To Be Clowns,19/02/2012,Ian,Sasha Regan’s All Male Patience, Union,"The all-male Gilbert and Sullivan adaptations at the Union Theatre have become something of an annual institution now and though we’ve been kept waiting a few more months than usual, the next instalment has arrived with Patience or Bunthorne’s Bride. Last year’s Iolanthe was exceptionally good and I rather enjoyed The Pirates of Penzance the year before so it was safe to say that expectations were rather high for this, but this was a show I knew nothing of beforehand – my love for G+S being mainly limited to the film of Pirates… which I watched over and over again as a child. Patience is a satirical look at the aesthetic movement (yeah, me neither) which was a fashionable movement of the 1880s that preached devotion to the arts and lofty ideals of love as a duty rather than a pleasure. We follow Reginald and Archibald as they both pursue a milkmaid named Patience, whilst a group of ladies swoon over the aesthetically minded pair of gents and ignore the returning bumptious soldiers to whom they were engaged the previous year. Gentle fun is poked at everyone as attentions shift from man to man and the hapless soldiers are left trying to become aesthetes themselves in order to win back their feckless ladies. The usual high standards of the Union are maintained here: Regan’s direction utilises the space well in the configuration that is seemingly becoming their default with seating in three banks along the width of the auditorium; Drew McOnie’s choreography has a wry humour about it which picks up much of the lyrical wordplay and translates it into witty routines which fill the room; and Kingsley Hall’s design is a foppish, floral, flowing flourish of homemade charm. Richard Bates’ musical direction from behind his piano keeps a tight rein on the ensemble, whose vocal talents really do stretch up the range without ever seeming strained. But for all the silly joyousness that occasionally shines through in this production, I couldn’t help but wonder if this is a conceit which is being stretched a little too thin now. Iolanthe worked magically with the ingenious concept of boys playing dress-up which meant one could read all sorts of meaning into their journeys of discovery and The Pirates of Penzance really benefitted from the contrast of buccaneers and maidens. But here the single-sex casting doesn’t really add anything, the shallowness of the narrative means little emotion can be generated, and the exaggeration that comes from poking fun at the aesthetic movement means that for once, the charge of camping it up could be laid at the door here and that hasn’t previously been the case."
408,408,Ought To Be Clowns,14/07/2012,Ian,Richard III, Shakespeare’s Globe,"The last time I was at the Globe (for Henry V), I made the mistake of mentioning that I had never actually been rained on whilst being a groundling. This time round, for the opening night of Richard III, we made it to the second half quite dry but then the heavens opened and I was forced to use my delightful yellow poncho whilst proved little respite against a rather heavy and sustained fall of rain which made me long for the hard comfort of the Globe’s (covered) seating. This Richard III is notable for seeing the return of Mark Rylance to the theatre where he was Artistic Director for 10 years where this all-male Original Practices-exploring company will also take on Twelfth Night later in the season and then transfer both to the West End. Given the tragic news just last week of the death of his stepdaughter, it is hard to know what to say or how to pitch any comments about Rylance. Though it is probably close to heretical to admit it, I’m not actually that big a fan of him as an actor, having found him too dominant a presence on stages before for my liking at least, but given that for once this is actually a play where that is the intention, I was willing to give this a try. Using the types of costumes and props that would have been available in 1593, Rylance sports a false arm complete with teeny withered hand (I jested at the interval that this is him saying ‘look, I can even do Shakespeare with one arm behind my back…’) and a rather muted demeanour as he limps and shuffles around the stage. His delivery prevails to the free-flowing conversational, almost stream-of-consciousness at times, which made it a different choice. It was one that took some getting used to, many in the audience found it extremely comical which jarred a little, and didn’t really convey the controlled deviousness one might have expected. But he does have a good line in crowd-whipping antics to shore up support for his coronation and brings the right note of irascible anger that flips on a dime. One can’t begin to imagine the herculean effort it must have taken to get through this week and any stutters and hesitations that there may have been – which given the style of delivery I’m not entirely sure weren’t all deliberate – can easily be forgiven. But it isn’t a one-man show by any means and there’s much interesting work around him in which some elements work beautifully. Liam Brennan’s Clarence is just masterful, exquisitely spoken and adroitly judged in his earnestness; Samuel Barnett’s measured Queen Elizabeth is a tightly controlled ball of seething emotion which erupts memorably at an intriguing moment, and John Paul Connelly and Jethro Skinner make an entertaining pair of murderers. I also liked the casting of the more-or-less appropriately youthful Lorenzo Allchurch/Dylan Standen as the Duke of York and Austin Moulton/Shanu Hazzan as the Prince of Wales (not sure who we got) though someone should have a word with Barnett about the clothes picked for his young princes. Elsewhere choices weren’t quite as strong: Johnny Flynn’s Lady Anne feels really uncomfortable in his vocal delivery and carriage, Paul Chahidi’s Tyrell is nowhere near malevolent enough and Colin Hurley’s wheezing King Edward feels overdone. And with the excision of the role of Margaret (though some of her lines are incorporated elsewhere, Elizabeth gets some in the second half for instance), there’s not quite the sense of impending doom, of cursed darkness stealing into Richard’s hermetic world and foretelling his downfall. Part of this comes from the audience’s willingness to laugh at almost anything regardless of what is actually meant, but also from Carroll’s direction which I think needs to rein in some of this broadness. Globe productions are what they are though, the sense of humour here will always be different to mine, and this is undoubtedly a Richard III which feels suited to the space. For me this doesn’t come anywhere near to Propeller’s incendiary reinterpretation of the play – but then I suspect nothing ever will – and this also lacks the fierceness of all the women that the Bridge Project brought across so powerfully. That said, aspects of my misgivings could well improve and indeed some might be fine with it as it is, and Rylance’s performance will undoubtedly mature as time passes to make this a hot ticket in a damp summer. Wow great and mark funny but the kids naturals and that dylan so loud and clear and so sweet as he was in Jerusalem  he changed it the woods bit he came out in blood so real and cuddled and held mark with real heart one to watch as his role in royal ballets the dream again A natural child one to watch out for he can change from roll to roll Children on opening night were Austin Moulton and Lorenzo Allchurch"
409,409,Ought To Be Clowns,20/11/2017,Ian,Klein Zielen, Stadschouwberg Amsterdam,"Completing a trilogy of Louis Couperus adaptations for Toneelgroep Amsterdam, Klein Zielen (Small Souls) is the kind of magisterial theatre on which reputations – such as Ivo van Hove’s – are sustained. Couperus is a Dutch writer with a kind of Rattigan-like status as his work is revived here and Klein Zielen is no exception, a study of a family living under the same roof but shattered by the neuroses and traumas of the past that haunt every moment of their existence.  This is about as lo-fi as van Hove gets, just the one video insert betraying any technological leanings, recalling the stark intensity of A View From The Bridge. And here again, you see the razor precision that he instils in his company and the way they relate to each other, interact with each other. As they each move around the wide open space of the Rabozaal carpeted in a ginormous rug, so much is said about their relationships in the juxtapositions they create. From Frieda Pittoors’ Moeder gradually withdrawing herself from life by rarely leaving the sanctuary of the plant-life that frames the stage to Maria Kraakman’s Mathilde, unwilling – or unable – to integrate into the family she’s married into, isolating herself on the upper levels. So too in moments of closeness, of disturbing intimacy, as fondness twists itself into desire, as sexual repression is uncorked to shattering effect. Writing at a similar time, it is tempting to see Chekhovian echoes in Couperus’ examination of the corrosiveness of stasis, of unfulfilled lives and frustrated passions. And Kleine Zielen carries the same awful weight, especially once light is spotted at the end of the tunnel and hopes are lifted – will anyone get the happy ending they’re dreaming of? No spoilers here but suffice to say that the exceptional Chris Nietvelt is never better than when carrying the entire weight of the world in the lugubrious depth of her voice as Constance.  There’s strong work too from Hélène Devos and Noortje Herlaar as the children of Constance’s brother who she now looks after. Devos’ Marietje, psychologically scarred by witnessing the aftermath of her father’s suicide, provides the most emotionally affecting performance of the evening but Herlarr, as the superficially more well-adjusted Gerdy is utterly compelling as we come to see the other ways that damage can be inflicted on the young.  The atmospheric swells of Harry De Wit’s live music underscoring the action is a vital part of the emotional texture of this world, its stabs of grand piano and clarinet squiggling (a technical term, I assure you) just as effective as the echoes of ‘Somewhere Over The Rainbow’. And the shifting tone of Jan Versweyveld’s lighting design is utterly gorgeous. It all adds up to subtly devastating effect as we discover over and over that no matter how small the soul, the pain it feels is no less acute.  "
410,410,Ought To Be Clowns,24/03/2012,Ian,Vera Vera Vera, Royal Court,"‘As above, so below’ so the saying goes, but in this case the opposite is true as the Royal Court upstairs follows the Hampstead Theatre downstairs in putting on a play which deals with the death of a young British soldier and its impact on the family left behind. But where Nick Payne’s Lay Down Your Cross focused on the parent-child dynamic, Hayley Squires’ Vera Vera Vera looks at how contemporaries are affected – the siblings and cousins left to mourn their loved ones and reassess their own lives in the light of tragedy. This play continues the Young Writers Festival which started with Goodbye to all That and as she originally trained as an actor, this is Squires’ first full-length play. She moves forward and back between two scenarios in present-day Kent: a pair of schoolkids make tentative steps to progressing their friendship into something more and three months later, a brother and sister prepare for the funeral of their younger brother, killed in combat in Afghanistan. Tom Piper’s design utilises the same central structure from Goodbye to all That which he also did, but this time around the edges are covered in grass and the Kentish countryside is suggested on the walls. Jo McInnes’ direction also harks back to that first production in keeping the cast visible on the staging area even when not involved in the scenes, but pushes it a little further by having some spiky non-verbal interactions between them during the scene changes – a little thing but most effective. And from her young cast, she teases some gorgeous performances. The relationship between the high-schoolers Charlie and Sammy is the stuff of teenage fantasy but delightful with it: Ted Riley’s swaggering Sammy a secret champion for the emotionally fragile Charlie, Abby Rakic-Platt in beautiful tenderly natural form, and there’s such a sweetness about this pairing that it is a joy to keep revisiting them. Squires captures perfectly the natural rhythm of friend-speak combined with a new awkwardness as the pair begin to cross the boundary that has marked their relationship thus far. Crucially, it is also extremely funny. The older generation, who’ve long lost that innocence, are given particularly rancorous antagonistic voice in the tortured brother/sister relationship of Tommy McDonnell’s Danny and Danielle Flett’s Emily, utterly convincing that a lifetime of petty squabbling lies behind this particular falling out. They well epitomise directionless small-town young adulthood with its warped sense of priorities and a grim trail of sex, drugs and violence. But Squires introduces a fifth character too, Daniel Kendrick’s much more affable Lee, the dead man’s best friend who is now sleeping with his sister on the QT. And though Lee see himself as the peacemaker, we see how even his behaviour has sown the seeds for destruction just as much as the aggressive behaviour he is witnessing. These sections don’t quite have the same level of impact, though still powerfully acted, as Emily is invested with just a little too much self-awareness to truly convince despite Flett’s best efforts. The portrayal of small-town apathy is well-judged but Squires needs to let it speak for itself rather than instead of pushing commentary into the mouths of her characters (though it is a problem that blights playwrights young and old so she’s in good company). For a short play, an hour straight through, Squires manages an extremely accomplished debut here: Vera Vera Vera is clear-sighted, punchy and perfectly formed and would be definitely worth a punt if it weren’t sold out. On a side note, this was my first Royal Court ‘pay what you like’ performance and it was surprisingly and thankfully easy to pick up tickets, there was no queue when I rocked up at 10.30 (tickets go on sale from 10am from the box office only) and is to be recommended as a way to get into shows which often sell out before the run even opens. I do find it a little frustrating when a run like this only actually features one £10 Monday – one of the Royal Court’s better innovations – due to an unfortunate juxtaposition of bank holidays and a press night on a Monday, it’s not the first time this has happened and I just think it would be nice if at least one of them were replaced with, oh I don’t know, Tuesdays for a tenner."
411,411,Ought To Be Clowns,20/04/2018,Ian,An Officer and a Gentleman, Curve,"From its opening number (which provides an unsettling reminder that Status Quo actually had a decent tune or two), this major new musical of An Officer and a Gentleman shimmers with a sense of real quality. Some might demur at the notion of a movie remake peppered with a random assortment of pop songs from the 1980s but the resulting piece of theatre is highly enjoyable. This is down to the integrity and craft of Nikolai Foster who rightly takes this source material (book by Douglas Day Stewart and Sharleen Cooper Cohen from his original screenplay) seriously. We may be in 1982 but there’s no jokey visual gags about that decade here, just an over-riding sense of life on the edge for the working class community of Pensacola, Florida, looking on at the US Naval Aviation Training Facility that dominates their city.  For the officer training class, the military offers an upwards route that transcends class, ethnicity, even gender (Keisha Atwell is aces as Seegar, aiming to be the first woman to graduate). But for the women of the Pensacola Paper Factory, it feels like their only way out is to ensnare one of these sharp-suited, tight-bodied officers, regardless of whether he is a gentleman. Aided by some vibrant choreography from Kate Prince, George Dyer’s orchestrations and arrangements of the 80s classics are carefully done, some leaving the material pretty much as is and others taking an interesting slant. ‘Kids in America’ becomes a middle-aged lament for a lost American Dream, ‘Material Girl’ is delivered with a straight-up cynicism, ‘I Want To Know What Love Is’ is neatly divided between two courting couples exploring both love and sex.   It is 4-time Olivier Award nominee Emma Williams who soars here. The way she elevates the already gorgeous version of ‘It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World’ that introduces the factory workers, through spine-tingling contributions to ‘Toy Soldiers’ and ‘Don’t Cry Out Loud’, to a properly sensational rendition of ‘Alone’. Her interpretative skill, even on these radio staples, is entirely captivating and just gorgeous to listen to.  But she’s not just one of the best singers we have, she’s a damn fine actress too, thoroughly inhabiting the depth of Paula’s desire to live life to the fullest and her passionate frustration at how difficult that proves to be, especially with her entanglement with Jonny Fines’ Zack getting more and more complicated. Ian McIntosh’s Sid matches her for intensity, and there’s strong support too from Rachel Stanley and Corinna Powlesland representing the older generation. Michael Taylor’s impressively realised set design looks a real treat, especially for a show that is set to tour extensively once it has left Leicester, and Ben Cracknell’s lighting holds some beautiful surprises. And that is symptomatic of the warm-hearted nature of a show that is unashamedly feel-good, even through its darker moments, and just waiting to sweep you off your feet."
412,412,Ought To Be Clowns,11/09/2010,Ian,Wanderlust, Royal Court,"Wanderlust, the new play from Nick Payne opening upstairs at the Royal Court, carries a warning of nudity and scenes of an adult nature. Frankly, having seen the second preview, it smacks of many a play advertising full frontal nudity in order to whip up a few headlines and controversy and hopefully translate it into ticket sales. It has clearly worked here as there’s already limited availability for the entire run but it wouldn’t surprise me if tickets start to become available once word spreads. The Richards family: Joy and Alan married for 24 years but haven’t had sex for 12 months and their 15 year old son Tim, desperate to get his first hands-on experience of the facts of life. Whilst looking at ways of trying to rescue their relationship, the sexually frustrated Alan has his eye turned by a colleague who needs comforting after witnessing another teacher pleasuring himself in a classroom after hours; the sexually repressed Joy has her own distraction in the shape of an old flame appearing at her surgery needing treatment for a sensitive matter, but interested in much more and the would-be sexually active Tim turns to his best (female) friend Michelle to show him the ins and outs of sexual congress so that he won’t disappoint an older girl he wants to seduce. As we follow each of them on their journeys, Payne purports to look at the relationship between sex and intimacy and the role each plays in relationships.  It isn’t bad, but it really isn’t anything special either. There’s some humour in there, the opening scene is classic and there’s a fair few witty observations and one-liners throughout, usually around sex or getting naked, but it is paper-thin, really rather dated and plays just like a sitcom on far too many occasions with a ridiculous number of very short scenes and then the occasional monologue from Joy. The cast do their best with the material: Siân Brooke as Clare has a nice line in sarcastic humour and Pippa Haywood has great comic chemistry with Charles Edward’s bumbling Stephen (although seeing him close up further makes one wonder how on earth he got cast as Oberon to Judi Dench’s Titania!) As the sexually curious teenagers Isabella Laughland and James Musgrave have a nice innocence about them, making their storyline curiously old-fashioned. It just doesn’t feel like anything new is being said here at all, and having set up this dilemma of whether love is a necessary part of sex and vice versa, it never comes to any satisfactory conclusions, avoiding going into the real reasons behind the estrangement between the Richards and in particular Joy’s frigidity. Matters are not helped by the way in which the play meanders to its conclusion. There’s a brief scene featuring Neil, the teacher caught masturbating, which adds little and confused me a little bit: he talks of being to Amsterdam yet clutches a duty free bag from Stavanger. And the rest of the storylines splutter to a halt, providing little if any meaningful discourse on the subject, instead offering trite observations. The staging is basic to say the least: the audience are on raked benches in one corner and the simply dressed sits in front: a desk to the left for Joy’s office, a desk on the right for Alan’s office and a double bed in the centre. There’s a couple of moments when scenes are run concurrently to great effect: both spouses were having an illicit post-work drink with their would-be lovers and each couple pushing past the other to say their line worked well and counterpointing Joy’s reminisces about her honeymoon with Alan getting a blowjob from another woman had its own sadistic humour, but otherwise Simon Godwin’s direction was a little uninspired. Pippa Haywood almost makes this worth seeing anyway, she has an innate gift for comedy which is well known to fans of Green Wing and The Brittas Empire and is frequently hilarious here, which in turn makes her sad scenes all the more heartbreaking. But it is not enough to save the whole show, which whilst having its moments of humour, is gossamer light, free of significant insight and consequently unmemorable.  Think you've maganged to get some of the actors names wrong….. Really? I took them from the programme. Can you tell me which ones are wrong? Hi Ian,The teenage son is called Tim and the teacher gone awol is Neil. Also Robin Soans wasn't in House of Games.Best,Matt"
413,413,Ought To Be Clowns,11/01/2005,Ian,By The Bog Of Cats, Wyndhams,"In this adaptation, the Medea figure is represented by Irish tinker Hester Swain, a woman living on a rural Irish bog and facing the fact that everything in her life is slipping away: her man, her child, her home, her heritage. Her younger lover has left her in order to wed a woman who can bring him increased wealth and prestige, and he constantly threatens to part Hester from their child in order to raise the girl in his new, more privileged world. The play opens at dawn on the fateful wedding day, and we watch the lengths Hester goes to as she fights like a hellcat not to lose what belongs to her as horrific secrets from the past reveal themselves. For me, Holly Hunter was note perfect in her performance: darkly humorous, spurned and sympathetic at times, yet as vicious as a wildcat as she is forced to be and at times utterly breathtaking in her desperation to reclaim the life she feels is hers by right. I loved being able to see such an accomplished film actress as Hunter up close and it was the power of her performance that pushed me through this production. As it isn’t perfect: there is so much talking in here rather than doing, that it was hard to maintain full attention. After about an hour, all we had really ascertained was that we were in Ireland, in a bog full of weird characters. Even once the events of the wedding had started, the wordiness dominated so that scenes were mostly static rather than full of the energy that should have driven the play onwards. The rest of the company did well to keep up with Hunter’s epic performance, Sorcha Cusack’s kindly neighbour, Trevor Cooper’s blustering father of the young bride and Bríd Brennan’s portentous Catwoman."
414,414,Ought To Be Clowns,11/07/2015,mag9l,Little Malcolm And His Struggle Against The Eunuchs, Southwark Playhouse,"You don’t get many plays set in Huddersfield but Little Malcolm And His Struggle Against The Eunuchs is such a one, written by the late David Halliwell who also wrote a play called K D Dufford Hears K D Dufford Ask K D Dufford How K D Dufford’ll Make K D Dufford and wrote a story for the Sixth Doctor that was tantalisingly never produced. This 50th anniversary production at the Southwark Playhouse is not without its challenges – the trimmed text still flirts with the three hour mark plus the late starting time in the smaller studio and both audience and duffle-coated cast alike are suffering from the lack of air-con. Duly warned, there’s a fascinating density to the torrent of verbosity here. Expelled from art school, Malcolm Scrawdyke fumes in his cluttered bedsit and decides to form his own political party from whence he can wreak vengeance on those who have wronged him and then wage rebellion against the world at large. Gathering fellow disillusioned souls around him, the fury of his rage elevates him – in his mind’s eye at least – to an exalted position as he rants and raves and plans and paves the way for revolution, if they could make it out of the front door that is. Clive Rudd’s production positions this critique of totalitarianism interestingly. Even when political divisions are as pronounced as they are today and seemingly exacerbated by Osborne’s every utterance, it cautions against the ease with which people gather round those with the most persistent voice when they’re railing against the world. Malcolm’s followers all have their own reasons for joining up but you can see in their eyes the joy of belonging to a gang, to what they superficially believe are like-minded souls. But they’re not, and Daniel Easton’s frighteningly assured performance as the disintegrating despotic Malcolm leaves us in no doubt as to how dark things will eventually become, even as he begins to show signs of self-awareness. Scott Arthur’s Nipple, as the recipient of much terrible ire, is a compelling presence, his late Act 1 monologue a thing of wonder and as later events turn sinister, the pathos he brings considerably deepens. A vein of scabrous black comedy runs through the entire play though, twisting all sorts of sympathies."
415,415,Ought To Be Clowns,26/10/2014,Ian,Wet House, Soho Theatre,"Now this, this is the state of the nation. A country in denial about its alcohol habits, a caring profession stretched to breaking point and beyond, a society ill-equipped to deal with the problems that arise from both – Paddy Campbell’s Wet House forces a brutally uncompromising look at what we too often turn our heads away from. And though it is a first play based on his own experiences working in a wet house – a residential facility for the chronically alcoholic and homeless where they can drink however much they want – its dramatic construction, mordant humour and stunning character work clearly mark Campbell as one to watch as Max Roberts’ production so skilfully shows. He plunges wet-behind-the-ears new graduate Andy into the murky waters of Crabtree House, such a hostel somewhere in the North East, with just the soggy good intentions of Helen and the eviscerating bone-dry wit of Mike to help keep him afloat. As Andy tries to become accustomed to the working practices of caring for people who, on the face of it, can’t or won’t be helped, the appalling truth of how much this work demands bobs into view and the coping mechanisms necessary, shocking as they may seem, perhaps that little bit more justified. It’s a testament to the veracity of the writing that this equivocation feels utterly, completely earned. And in the hands of Chris Connel, the character of Mike emerges as one of the most devastatingly effective and intensely performed of the year. Mike’s a man who really fills the space around him – when siting his legs spread wide, when standing his shoulders jut menacingly, either way you wouldn’t want to bump into him in the pub and yet he’s exactly the guy who’ll end up at your table, unwilling to leave you alone. Darkly, bleakly funny, this former squaddie’s military toughness is both a blessing and a curse to his daily dealings with the drunks as the arrival of a convicted paedophile alters the balance of the tough love he metes out with appallingly vicious consequences. Yet Connel never lets us forget there’s more to him too, one of his final actions in the play is almost unbearably moving to watch."
416,416,Ought To Be Clowns,15/05/2019,Ian,Orpheus Descending, Menier Chocolate Factory,"Any project that tempts Hattie Morahan back onto the stage has to be worth checking out (qv Anatomy of a Suicide, A Doll’s House, but maybe let’s not mention The Dark Earth and the Light Sky…). Orpheus Descending, a Menier Chocolate Factory & Theatr Clwyd co-production directed by Tamara Harvey, proves no exception, bolstered by the presence of the ever-excellent Jemima Rooper in the cast, plus a brooding Seth Numrich. Orpheus… is something of a minor Tennessee Williams work (one I didn’t much enjoy when I saw it at the Royal Exchange a few years ago) but one which feels stronger here. Navigating the stifling heat and social strictures of smalltown Deep South in the 1950s, Lady seeks escape from her loveless marriage and small-minded neighbours. And in the arrival of handsome drifter Val Xavier, it seems she might have found it – doesn’t it?  The decision to have the stage directions read aloud lends a poetic beauty from the off, but where Harvey really excels is in evoking the suffocating mentality of pettiness and backbiting that so often characterises the disenfranchised, demonstrating how pernicious attitudes can flourish even in environments full of the oppressed. Racism and misogyny are the flavours of the day here, as women with no rights turn viciously on those who break the social code by even looking at ‘outsiders’ and men, most men, well they fulfil every lowest expectation as per, whether in a Williams play or not. "
417,417,Ought To Be Clowns,09/04/2018,Ian,Plastic, Old Red Lion,"Deeply poetic, densely constructed and deftly performed, Kenneth Emson’s Plastic finds itself in the unfortunate position of being considered timely. In its depiction of the way violence insinuates itself into society through schoolhood trauma, and disproportionately affects teenagers, it has a horrible currency reflected in the rising crime rates that Amber Rudd apparently knows so little about. Set in Emson’s native Essex, at a secondary school where old friendships have been recalibrated along new tribal lines, Plastic examines not just the faultlines that emerge from being bullied, but the hopelessness that accompanies the thought that being the popular kid might just be as good as life will ever get. Brutal and bleak, it is uncompromising about how desperate life can get for those feel left behind.  Constructed as a memory play, in verse, and endlessly flitting from past to present and between its four characters, Emson sure makes us work to find clarity. But director Josh Roche makes sure that we soon get attuned to its rhythms, its repetitions, picking up clues as to what’s going on, even if they soon turn out to be red herrings, no prisoners being taken here when it comes to predictability. "

419,419,Ought To Be Clowns,30/06/2011,Ian,Richard III, Propeller at Hampstead Theatre,"It seems only natural that Edward Hall would bring Propeller’s touring double bill of Richard III and The Comedy of Errors to the Hampstead Theatre, he is after all the Artistic Director for both the all-male Shakespeare company and the Swiss Cottage venue, but when the shows were first announced, there was no mention of London in the tour. Keen to have my first Propeller experience, trips were made to Guildford and Sheffield to see the shows and then as sod’s law would have it of course, a short residency in London was announced. Still, I am glad that I got to see the shows earlier, way back in November in the case of Richard III, as it has meant I was able to see them, love them, recommend them to all and sundry as they toured the country and finally get to revisit both shows as I’m pretty sure this is about as good as interpretations of Shakespeare can get.  My review of Richard III back in November in Guildford can be read here and to be honest and somewhat less than humble, reading it back, I think it is one of my best pieces of writing in capturing how exhilarating a production it is and how enthusiastic I felt about it. Very little of my exceedingly positive opinion has changed and taking in a second viewing allowed me to appreciate some of the smaller details that passed me by first time round as there really are so many inventive touches in here, it feels impossible to soak them all in with a single viewing. The only real difference I felt was that foreknowledge of the musical backdrop meant that it had less of an impact: not in a bad way but rather it demanded less of my attention which meant I could focus more on the strength of the acting and the beautiful natural flow of the verse-speaking from pretty much every member of the company. I won’t list all the actors I loved again, but Clothier’s almost-supernatural super-villain is a truly stirring central presence, whilst Tony Bell and Dominic Tighe’s Queens Margaret and Elizabeth respectively create worlds of fiery and keening emotion in amongst the state-craft."
420,420,Ought To Be Clowns,25/03/2018,Ian,Assassins, Pleasance,"It was interesting to discover in the post-show Q&A that an explicit reference to Trump has been excised from this production of Assassins – a picture of his head removed from the shooting gallery that provides the stark image, and framing device, that opens and closes the show. But given that that above quote comes in very early on, contemporary political resonance is rarely too hard to find, should you wish to look for it. That’s all the more impressive given that Stephen Sondheim (music and lyrics) and John Weidman (book) constructed this show back in 1990. And the allure of this slice of Americana, as much musical history as it is socio-political, has proven enduringly popular as it explores something of the people behind the nine recorded attempted assassinations of US presidents.  Directed and designed by Louise Bakker for Sevans Productions, this production plays up the metaphysical nature of the show. This ragtag group from across history collected together in a waiting room where, guided by the commentary of the emcee-like Proprietor (Peter Watts) and the narrative skill of the Balladeer (the appealing Jason Kajdi), they get to tell their stories and themselves held to account as well, .  As the book touches on the varied reasonings – the mental health issues, the economic pressures, the complete dislocation from society – one can’t help but wish the company could amplify and deepen these threads, particularly on a weekend where people #marchforourlives but fair dos, this isn’t a musical about gun control. What does hit home is the scene of rubbernecking bystanders, indicting a society too keen to be seen rather than addressing such a pernicious ill at its very heart."
421,421,Ought To Be Clowns,12/01/2012,Ian,Mary Stuart, Faction at the New Diorama,"When I booked in for the first show in the Faction’s rep season, Twelfth Night, I knowingly said ‘I hope this isn’t good’ as I knew that if it were, then I would be suckered into seeing their other two shows. But it was, exceedingly so, and so I found myself back at the New Diorama for the opening of the second show, Schiller’s 1880 play Mary Stuart in a new version by Daniel Millar and Mark Leipacher. One of my big theatrical regrets of pre-blogging times was missing the Donmar’s production of this play and so this was my first time of seeing it, though I’m fairly familiar with the history, it being an era I’ve always liked. Schiller depicts the final days of the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, the Catholic cousin and rival to the throne of Elizabeth I, as she is held under house arrest in England whilst the queen decides on her fate. The intrigues of the Elizabethan court are vividly captured as noblemen’s loyalties remain murkily hidden with religion and politics playing off against each other and double-dealing being the order of the day. The Faction have gone for a bit of a mash-up here (their word, not mine!), combining a modern spy thriller aesthetic with the historical drama in a mixture that is a little slow to start but soon catches fire as the stormy battle of wills between these two women who both feel wronged grows in intensity until a climactic meeting. Derval Mellett’s Mary is gorgeously essayed, righteous indignation seething under her carefully composed exterior and utterly compelling to watch. And Kate Sawyer’s Elizabeth matches her well with an intelligent portrayal of a woman struggling with ideas of legitimacy, sovereignty and basic morality as a death warrant awaits her signature. What I really loved about seeing the ensemble again though was seeing them take on different roles so soon. Gareth Fordred’s slippery, side-swapping Leicester was brilliant as was Tom Radford’s Mortimer, a fervently passionate supporter for Mary and a vision in his cords!; Leonie Hill’s faithful maid Kennedy was another strong supporting presence, few words to speak but saying volumes with her face. There’s no way I’m going to miss Miss Julie now to complete the set and hopefully see everyone get their chance to really shine. And not content with the ‘simple’ challenge of putting on three shows together in seven weeks, the Faction have further upped the stakes by choosing to stage each show in a different configuration, really exploring the potential of this theatrical space: where Twelfth Night was presented end-on, Mary Stuart is staged in traverse. This was something of a challenge as the limitations of the auditorium did not allow for a free-flowing production from end to end, and in reality, with the seating in four quadrants, the playing space was actually a cross with a fair bit of the action bunched up into the middle. The theatre’s not big enough for it to be much of a problem but sightlines did become a little awkward at times. The only other tiny point I had related to the comparative lack of staging innovation, although this was totally because of how they infused Twelfth Night with great imagination. The use of projection was inspired: captions with brief bios about each of the key players proved useful, and the close-ups of important documents proving how well the story slipped into its current-day guise – the Spooks-like ending to the first act was genius – and in some ways it is a shame that they didn’t push further with this modernity in the interpretation. It is only at the end, with Mary’s beheading do we really get a piece of magical staging which is superbly done, and then leading into the fierce punch of the final revelatory scene."
422,422,Ought To Be Clowns,26/02/2015,mag9l,Beautiful – The Carole King Musical, Aldwych Theatre,"Where Broadway leads, the West End will surely follow and so it is little surprise that Tony-winning Beautiful – The Carole King Musical found its way over here to the Aldwych Theatre. And I’m pleased to report that the transatlantic passage has gone most smoothly indeed to deliver an absolute treat of a show. When three of its four leading personnel are still very much alive and kicking, it is perhaps no surprise that Douglas McGrath’s book treads a rather respectable path through the first ten years of King’s career. But then she would be the first to say, with typical self-deprecating charm, that her life is hardly the most exciting, her dreams never the loftiest – it just so happens that beneath this veneer of ordinariness lay an absolute treasure trove of extraordinary music.  And as musical gem follows musical gem – both from the collaborations of King and sometime partner Gerry Goffin, and also from their friends and writing rivals Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann – this feels utterly the point. Life isn’t always chock-a-block with drama, motivations don’t always have to spring from some momentous event, the cult of the tortured artistic soul is far from the be all and end all (Billington seems to suggest being “a shy, well-adjusted woman struggling to reconcile a career with a failing marriage” is something of a crime!) and I’d say that Beautiful is no weaker a biopic for not having such narrative peaks and troughs, reinventing personal history in the name of drama.  The show remains understated throughout, even when bigger issues feel like they may come to light – the racial politics of being the co-writer of the first African-American girl group number one in ‘Will You Love Me Tomorrow’, the sexual politics of being a highly successful woman in a male-dominated business. Rather, emotional vibrancy comes out of the normalcy of life – Lorna Want pairs Weil’s wonderfully dry wit with real heart when it comes to the galumphing charms of the ever-faithful and adorably geeky Ian McIntosh as Mann and that the end result of their competitive feelings towards King and Goffin is a trade-off of number one hit records and an awkward abortive game of strip poker is symptomatic of the world of this show.  And Katie Brayben gives a fabulously star-making turn as King herself, animated gorgeously every time she sits at a piano and shares the gift of her musical genius, suggesting the individual traits of the woman but never reducing her performance to an imitation, finding her own take on the unaffected purity that resonated with so many millions of record buyers. Brayben also nails the expressive feeling of the (fake) keyboard playing perfectly as well, the sound may be coming from the band but you just know that she’s note perfect anyway, this really is the perfect marriage of actor and role at the ideal time in her career which will surely be long and fruitful.  Derek McLane’s glossy scenic design allows the show to feel like a glamorous version of Top of the Pops, especially when the hit songs are being reeled off by the like of The Shirelles and The Drifters and the perky energy of Little Eva (who was the babysitter for King and Goffin’s daughter). And Marc Bruni’s direction keeps things big and bright to ensure the whole shebang ticks over just so. There might be more deeply insightful biographical musicals around but Beautiful has one of the best performances in town in Brayben and one of the most glorious collections of songs to make it a hugely enjoyable evening indeed. "

424,424,Ought To Be Clowns,10/07/2014,mag9l,Hotel, National Theatre,"Though Polly Stenham has been definitively anointed the next big thing by any number of feature writers, her repeated brand of “posh dysfunction” (I’m borrowing this from someone but I forget exactly who) has never really got my pulse racing. So when Hotel, her play for the National Theatre’s formerly-The-Shed-but-now-called-The-Temporary-Space-I-think, opens with two precocious teenagers and two bourgeois parents all suffering from the malaise of being that only a holiday to a luxurious African island resort can cure, my heart did verily sink. Mother Vivienne has just had to resign from the cabinet due to a sex scandal that has engulfed her stay-at-home husband Robert whilst kids Ralph and Frankie look on bemusedly although not without some deeper connection as it turns out. But as we settle down for (yet another) family drama, Stenham pulls out the rug from us (and them) with a massive tonal shift which throws everyone off-balance, so much so that I’m not sure we ever regain a satisfactory equilibrium between the two very different parts of the play. The move into eco-terrorism is unexpected but in its twists and turns, it never really quite convinces. Native chambermaids turn out to be South London activists who are lumbered with the most awkward kind of speechifying that ranges from the evils of imperialism to anger at the aid deals that Vivienne’s administration forced upon this part of the world. It’s important stuff but it never ever feels like natural dialogue, we’re just being lectured at which is never a good thing. Plus Stenham feels a need to continue being labyrinthine which overdoes the twistiness."
425,425,Ought To Be Clowns,05/02/2014,Ian,The Light Princess, NT,"There’s not really much more to say than to bid a fond farewell to this most beloved of shows. Despite the fierce love it engendered in its devoted fans, I personally don’t think a transfer would have necessarily worked so well. There’s something wonderfully neat about its life at the Lyttelton, the length and nature of its run in rep meaning that Rosalie Craig was able to make every single performance – an impressive feat even before one touches on the extraordinary demands of the lead role. And getting to see the final show, with a large group of people who had been equally (if not more) touched by the work – and that includes the extraordinary cast and company, I don’t think I’ve ever seen so much visible emotion at the end of a run – was a genuine privilege.  Since the show shone so brightly, yet so briefly, it has left the kind of indelible impression that will be impossible to shift. I saw it five times in total – you can read about visits one, two, three and four – and each time, it surprised me, its densely complex nature revealing something new each time with different musical motifs becoming prominent, the various themes shifting in emphasis, the texture of the show almost malleable in its changeability. So now we have to wait for the soundtrack and dream of once upon a once a, once upon a time. “What you have done, has brightened the world” "
426,426,Ought To Be Clowns,04/03/2010,Ian,London Assurance, National Theatre,"Dion Boucicault’s 1844 play, London Assurance, the latest National Theatre production is a rip-roaring, farcical romp of a show that should leave even the most depressed Phantom of the Opera fan with a smile on their face. With a quality all-star ensemble: Simon Russell Beale, Fiona Shaw, Richard Briers, Michelle Terry, Paul Ready, all hamming it up for all they are worth, I can’t recommend this highly enough. Sir Harcourt Courtly, a London socialite travels up to Gloucestershire, determined to procure himself a much younger wife-to-be, heiress Grace Harkaway, yet once there his head is turned by her cousin, Lady Gay Spanker, a forthright horse-riding fox-hunting Amazon of a woman. To further complicate matters, Sir Harcourt’s son Charles is also there, in disguise hiding from his creditors, and has fallen for Grace. Sensing the opportunity for merriment, Charles’ friend Richard Dazzle then colludes with Lady Gay to toy with the bumptious Sir Harcourt and lead him astray. It’s all extremely silly, as one would expect from a Victorian farce and to describe this as hammy would be an insult to all things porcine. It is so over the top, but performed with such relish and humour that it is hard not to get swept along with it. Even the asides to the audience, something I have little time for usually, were expertly done. The highlights are undoubtedly any time that Shaw and Russell Beale are together: they are pure comedy gold, and obviously relish their interactions, there were even a couple of moments where I thought one or the other might corpse, great fun! Fiona Shaw edged it for me, if only for her wonderful guffawing laugh which permeates the whole show, but also in her tenderness to her ageing husband (played by a doddering Richard Briers) which fleshes out the character. Simon Russell Beale is equally hysterical and there are moments when you suspect that he thinks he’s in a pantomime, such are the exaggerated mannerisms that he displays. Their costumes are fantastic, and I don’t want to say more than that, only that never have the publicity shots for a show here been less representative of what’s on stage! As Grace, Sir Harcourt’s intended, Michelle Terry is excellent as ever, her comic timing really is superb, and with Paul Ready as the son with whom she falls in love, provided a gentler counter-balance to the sledgehammer antics of the lead couple. And elsewhere there were good performances from Nick Sampson as the arch manservant of Sir Harcourt, full of dry quips and raised eyebrows; Matt Cross as a warmly charming wideboy Dazzle, pulling the strings of all concerned with a consummate ease, and a hilarious late brief interjection from Jinx Inocian as a debt collector. The set is an impressive country pile, utilising the Olivier’s revolve to flit between the outside and the sumptuously mounted interior, but they do thankfully keep the spinning down to a minimum. Music was performed on stage (including a tuba), but also kept on a subtle level, coming to the fore though during a fun country dancing sequence."
427,427,Ought To Be Clowns,01/11/2017,Ian,The Trap, Omnibus,"Set over a long night of the soul for the employees of a payday loans company, Kieran Lynn’s play The Trap is described as “a biting new comedy”. And for once, it does actually provide a fair few laughs, of the decidedly darkly comic sort, as it simultaneously shines an uncompromising light on the seedier end of capitalist society – the market for short-term loans and the predatory way in which the most-in-need are tempted in. We open with Tom and Clem breaking into an office to steal money from a safe there, and it soon turns out that they are disgruntled employees trying to pull a fast one. But Lynn’s trick is to show how the perils of debt stretch far and wide and so they are eventually joined by branch manager Alan (gambling addict) and regional manager Meryl (mortgaged to the hilt) who are also searching for an quick route to assuage their financial woes. At just 70 minutes and with its comic twist, The Trap isn’t a play that delves deeply into the issues it raises but ultimately that’s no bad thing. Meryl’s (the brilliant Wendy Kweh) messaging from head office touches on the despicable business practices, the metrics to identify the best times to target the desperate, and Tom (a well observed Jahvel Hall) and Clem (a sharply witty Sophie Guiver) exemplify the grinding depression of the rent trap, working all hours in a poorly paid job to barely afford to pay avaricious landlords."
428,428,Ought To Be Clowns,12/03/2011,Ian,Godspell, Ye Olde Rose and Crown,"Godspell is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year and this version by All Star Productions at Ye Olde Rose And Crown Theatre in Walthamstow will be swiftly followed by one at the Union Theatre in Southwark, keen to pay tribute to this rock opera with music by Stephen Schwartz, who later went on to write a little show called Wicked. It is based on the Gospel according to St Matthew, following the last days of Jesus’ life and featuring dramatised versions of well known parables in a vaguely hippy-inspired style with his disciples recast as a group of flower children around him. This version has been updated to feature quite a few contemporary references but the hippy aesthetic is one that has endured and the timelessness of the stories being told: love thy neighbour, respect those around you, don’t cross over to the other side, means that it is a show which pushes love and tolerance rather than any particular religion which is why I think it remains so popular. That, and the score which contains some great songs, ‘Day By Day’, ‘Prepare Ye…’ and my favourite, ‘By My Side’. It needs a strong performer in the central role of Jesus, and this production was Brian Elrick fulfilling the role, full of righteous anger at those who do not follow his words, a touching compassion for those that do and a powerful voice which carried well through the small space above this pub. Too often though, the solo vocal performances from the ensemble were just not strong enough to provide the necessity clarity to convey the lyrical deftness of say, ‘All For The Best’ or the cheeky adlibs of ‘Turn Back O’Man’, or indeed to match the strident synthesised musical accompaniment led by Aaron Clingham from the keyboard. Only in the quieter piano songs like ‘By My Side’ did the performers, Geraldine Allen and Emma Manley, manage to deliver a fully comprehensible rendition or in the group numbers where the ensemble combined to mostly great effect. And it is the ensemble work that sticks most in the mind, whether playing children at story-telling time to hear about the seeds that fell on stony ground, telling the story of a judge through the medium of X-Factor or simply reacting to Jesus leaving them, the commitment and enthusiasm throughout is cheerily relentless and cannot help but begin to win one over. Combined with a score which is filled with some great tunes (and a couple of clunkers it must be said), this is never a dull evening but it would have been nice to have the better sound balance from everyone that is very much needed."
429,429,Ought To Be Clowns,15/01/2011,Ian,The Boy James, Southwark Playhouse,"Belt Up Theatre played Southwark Playhouse last year and return there once more, this time with their show The Boy James, written by Alexander Wright and inspired by the early life of JM Barrie. Tucked away in a space created in one of the vaults at the rear of the building rather than the main auditorium, we’re guided to a cosy sitting room cum study dressed with faded draped fabrics and umpteen childhood toys and mementos by a young pyjama-clad boy, who with great enthusiasm encourages us to make friends with the people around us and play games like tag and I-Spy. It is a thoroughly enchanting introduction into this world and perfect at drawing the audience into the child-like wonder with which the story is told. The comfortable cocoon of innocence is broken by the arrival of the adult world in the shape of James, Barrie himself, with his weary experience and also in the shape of another intruder who brings violence and sexual awareness to this world, really pushing home the message about the sadness of losing childhood innocence and the pain that the adult world brings with it. But despite this immersive approach, The Boy James is a little too abstract to really truly engage. It is all rather ephemeral, the story especially, so there is no real focus to proceedings, no matter how atmospheric the environment. There just doesn’t seem to be much clarity in what Belt Up are trying to achieve here or at least in the way they are communicating it to the audience: this lack of focus means there’s no real drive to the production, it just sort of happens."
430,430,Ought To Be Clowns,21/06/2017,Ian,Gloria, Hampstead,"Truth be told I hadn’t intended to see Gloria, my own little act of protest at the Hampstead’s continuing gender imbalance – six shows straight on their main stage both written and directed by men. But the delights of An Octoroon introduced me to the writing of Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and he definitely feels like a playwright with a lot to say so I sucked it up and went to Swiss Cottage for a cheeky preview, ironically the location for the Women Centre Stage festival late last year. Gloria sets out as a dark office comedy, shady and sharp as it navigates the ruthless ambition of a pool of young(ish) editorial assistants in the Manhattan offices of a national magazine. It’s a scathing satire of the journalism industry and the way it has evolved, or not as the case may be – time was that a foot on the bottom of the ladder meant you could reasonably expect to get to the top but times change, cubicle warfare has intensified, and in this uncertain modern world, you’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do. Just exactly what that is is a surprise that unfolds magnificently in Michael Longhurst’s production. The barbed conversation between this group as they scope out the changing landscape is highly enjoyable – the sucking up to the boss, the secretive hopes for a book deal, the decline in journalistic standards, the rise of the internet (shudder!), particularly as Jacobs-Jenkins allows it to get as vicious as office chat can get, as pettiness curdles into outright savagery. And once the shift comes, it is impossible to view Gloria without considering recent events that have rocked the UK. In a world where showing concern online is smacked down as virtue-signalling, where politicians must show the exact right amount of grief, where journalists trample on decency for the race for the scoop, we’re asked who has the right to tell whose story, can anyone legitimately ‘gain’ from certain events or only those most directly affected. It’s thought-provoking stuff, especially since it is such a sea-change from earlier scenes, and even though the play finishes on the same darkly comic note, its concerns still niggle away at the conscience. Longhurst balances these well though I must confess to not being much of a fan of Lizzie Clachan’s design for once, the logic behind the soundstage escaping me, the viewlines of the (ugly) coffee shop penalising anyone sitting on the far left."
431,431,Ought To Be Clowns,08/01/2012,Ian,Twelfth Night, The Faction at New Diorama,"With a burst of enthusiasm and ambition that should inspire anyone who is already struggling to keep their New Year’s resolutions,The Faction Theatre company are launching into 2012 with a three play rep season for the next seven weeks at the New Diorama Theatre. First up is Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, a romantic comedy of assumed identities, passionate yearnings and carousing nobles with a hard edge of revenge. The play is well suited for a large ensemble – the 11 actors here will all star in all 3 plays – and in Mark Leipacher’s production, proves a considerable, imaginative success. The black box of the New Diorama is kept bare and the use of props judiciously low thus focusing the attention on the text, which is extremely well spoken here, and on the physical language employed by the company which creates some moments of striking imagery. The cell within which Malvolio finds himself interned is created from bodies and hands pressed all around him; the tree for the gulling scene made from six actors outstretched and swaying gently in the breeze; the shipwreck is powerfully evoked through movement, and a bedtime scene is extremely wittily and cleverly portrayed. It all makes for a constantly engaging production which, with the great deal of pace, means the attention is rarely allowed to waver. One can also see the great deal of attention that has gone into the character-work and the relationships between them, in particular with the tricksters. Leonie Hill’s devilishly twinkle-eyed Maria clearly has deep affection for Richard Delaney’s excellent Sir Toby, and as his counterpart Aguecheek, Jonny McPherson makes a rather sweetly tender nice-but-dim man who I was rather taken by. But Gareth Fordred as a powerfully convincing Malvolio who one genuinely feels for, and Lachlan McCall’s Feste, a banjo-wielding melancholy troubadour who provides some gorgeous musical moments, stole the acting honours for me. So it was touching and it was funny, the only area where I wanted more was in its sexiness. Kate Sawyer’s Viola didn’t quite work for me once transformed into Cesario, not enough of the erotic masculinity that would explain the swift tumbling of both Olivia and Orsino to his/her charms. Derval Mellett’s Olivia is excellent though, especialy once her libido is thoroughly awakened, though Shai Matheson’s Orsino didn’t quite hit the mark, the homoeroticism of the sauna room was a nice touch though. And I failed to see what the opening sequence, atmospheric as it was, meant or contributed to the overall interpretation: looking back it just doesn’t seem to fit, though in the grand scheme of things it is only a small bugbear."
432,432,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2016,mag9l,The Phantom of the Opera, Her Majesty’s (#Phantom30th),"I’ve been blogging here for a handful of years now, but I’ve never quite made it to The Phantom of the Opera in that time (I think I saw it last in 2002). Probably because it has that ‘old faithful’ air about it, especially to those of us who live in London, but also because its enduring popularity means that there’s rarely any ticket deals around for the show. Perhaps with an element of that in mind, the decision to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the show represented the perfect opportunity to finally revisit as tickets were most reasonably priced at £19.86 and £30. And I’m glad I got to go again. There’s undoubtedly a hoary quality to certain aspects of the show (the synth sound will never become a classic one…) but by and large, it is looking and sounding in pretty good shape for a 30 year old. This feels mainly down to the electric charge that comes from Ben Forster and Celinde Schoenmaker’s lead performances as The Phantom and Christine Daaé. There’s a refreshing, almost raw, emotional energy to their connection, manifesting itself in powerfully interpreted vocals, especially in ‘The Music of the Night’ and ‘Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again’ respectively.  As third wheel in their relationship Raoul, Nadim Naaman contrasts well with his more classical turn, and it is this love triangle – more than anything, I think – that keeps people coming back to Harold Prince’s production, though the multitudinous surprises of Maria Björnson’s design also maintain a certain thrill. And as befitting a gala performance, there were thrills aplenty in the post-show finale with paid loving tribute to the casts and creatives who have preserved the Phantom brand as it has gone literally worldwide, garnering incredible statistics as one of the longest-running shows on both Broadway and in the West End. Thus we were treated – after being given a glass of free fizz to cover the waiting time – to special guest performances from Michael Ball, flirting and duetting with all and sundry in a hilarious ‘All I Ask Of You’, Sierra Boggess – scheduled to play Christine in Phantom’s French-language debut in Paris, currently delayed because of a fire in the theatre *cough* curse *cough* – delivering a sensational bilingual ‘Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again’, and then a group rendition of the title track involving Icelandic dreamboat Garðar Thór Cortes (who’ll play Phantom in Paris), John Owen-Jones and the current company’s Scott Davies alongside Forster, Boggess and Schoenmaker. Delicioso!"
433,433,Ought To Be Clowns,20/08/2010,Ian,The Merry Wives of Windsor, Shakespeare’s Globe,"            Have to disagree a bit, we thought Ceri-Lyn was good. Though Gerard didn't look comfortable and was a little too 'stagey' in his speaking, should relax a little more into the role throughout the run. Looking back on it, I just don't think that thread was half as interesting as the main one and so suffered by comparison. Personally, I would have been tempted to play up the role of the lovers in a more comic way to balance with the rest of the production."
434,434,Ought To Be Clowns,20/02/2012,Ian,From Elsewhere: On the Watch…,,"“A door always leads to somewhere” The final piece in the second part of the Tricycle’s The Bomb – a partial history returns to Zinnie Harris with From Elsewhere: On the Watch… where she revisits her characters of Frisch and Peierls from the opening From Elsewhere: a message… The scientists who did so much to advance the initial discoveries around nuclear technology have now been reincarnated as weapons inspectors in Iran who are confronted with the reality of what has been wrought with the revelations that came from their laboratory. It’s a little heavy-handed in places and again doesn’t really possess much dramatic pull, but ultimately there is much that works about it. Daniel Rabin and Rick Warden has genuine chemistry as old friends who know each other inside out; there’s a deep recognition of the futility of much of the process of inspection, and the sense of unity that comes from revisiting this pair makes as neat an ending as one could have hoped for in such a hugely complex area as is covered altogether here."
435,435,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Gentleman Jack, Brockley Jack,"The temptation with biographies – particularly of those of trailblazing figures – can be to treat them with the kind of reverence that smooths away rough edges, excusing behaviour that would otherwise be questionable and questioned. So it is pleasing to see that Ross McGregor’s new play Gentleman Jack respects its subject enough to give a full picture of their life. That subject is Anne Lister, a nineteenth century Yorkshirewoman whose determination to buck societal convention earned her the sobriquet of the “first modern lesbian”. Her daring lay more than just in her open sexuality though; as an heiress and landowner, she redefined expectations of what women could achieve society as she and her partner sought to break into the mining industry. Such forthright rebellion against the patriarchy naturally comes with rubbing up men the wrong way, but where McGregor’s writing finds real interest is in the uncompromising attitudes Lister struck in her personal life. As she conducted many a love affair from her Halifax base, she demanded nothing less than the same convention-smashing boldness from her lovers. Brave on the one hand, to be sure, but recklessly uncaring of the position that her privilege afforded too – so few others could afford to say f*** you to society in a similar way. McGregor’s production shows us this by splitting his timeline in three. We see a young Anne (Lucy Ioannou with quicksilver vibrancy) charming her way into a love triangle and cruelly extricating herself from it. A more experienced Anne (the reliably superb Cornelia Baumann) learning how to focus the cutting edge and yet still leave herself open for love. And framing the story is Anne’s descendant John Lister (poignantly played by Alex Stevens), a gay man and aspiring politician whose discovery of the coded diaries she kept strikes an undeniable chord."
436,436,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2017,mag9l,The Mutant Man, Space Arts Centre,"I do admire a play – and a production – that isn’t afraid to make its audience work. Christopher Bryant’s The Mutant Man relays the true story of Harry Crawford, a man accused of murder, a woman who was born Eugenia Falleni, a transgender man living at the turn of the last century. And Heather Fairbairn’s production takes these questions of gender fluidity and runs full pelt into her box of tricks, emerging with a densely constructed and thought-provoking sense of theatricality. Using the murder trial as a focal point gives us as much purpose as we’re able to easily discern, the non-linear narrative allows fractured biography to seep through for though Clementine Mills is credited with playing Harry and Matthew Coulton Eugenia, each also takes on several other roles as well as exploring all the complexities of the protagonist. And what complexities they are as the notion of gender as a construct slams up hard time and again against a resolutely intolerant society – plus ça change… Influences from contemporary theatre companies such as Complicite and Forced Entertainment loom large but Fairbairn’s magpie instinct fashions its own queer beauty here. Live and recorded video (Sapphire Goss) interplay beautifully, perspective is toyed with most effectively (the bloody hands – yeesh!), Sean Gleason’s inventive take on the lighting pays extraordinary dividends especially when it plays with shadow, and Sebastian Afterbury’s soundscape keeps us marvellously off-kilter. And in the midst of it all, fragments of the tale are presented to us, like a jigsaw it is impossible to complete. A love story for the ages but based on a lifelong-held secret (Harry’s wife Annie was allegedly blissfully unaware of her partner’s status), brutal rape ending in pregnancy and everything that suggests for the parent/child dynamic, the weight of societal prejudice forcing through terrible decisions. At just 70 minutes, there’s just not enough time to unpick the many layers we’re presented with here in Mills and Coulton’s superbly nuanced performances and there’s a slight sense that The Mutant Man ends just as it is hitting its stride. That said, questions around gender identity are some of the most difficult that a person can face individually and that society as a whole ignores at its peril and so it’s hard not to feel that this production has the right to be just as challenging."
437,437,Ought To Be Clowns,30/08/2014,Ian,Crystal Springs, Park Theatre,"The world of cyber-bullying may be new and uncharted territory that parents have to delve into but Kathy Rucker’s Crystal Springs Rucker’s play doesn’t have too much to say that is new or original in all honesty but its structure means that it takes a while for this to emerge and in the telling, it does fitfully engage. We start at the end, in the aftermath of a teen suicide and with the help of a journalist who has a book deal, we work backwards to discover the detail of a tragic tale of class conflict and jealousy in which the mothers are as much to blame as the daughters whose initially bright friendship becomes soured."
438,438,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2018,Ian,Out Of Love, Orange Tree,"Reflecting the impressive balance of their Roundabout season (an ensemble that’s 2/3s female and two out of three playwrights being women as well – see artistic directors, it can be done!), Elinor Cook’s Out Of Love places female friendship at the heart of its storytelling. 30 years of love and loss, dreams and betrayals, wrapped into a fractured narrative which denies nothing of how complex a thing friendship can be.  Lorna and Grace have been great pals since as long as they can remember. But given the structure of the play, as soon as they’re declaring that they are going to be friends forever and that nothing can tear them apart, we’re 10, 15, 20 years down seeing exactly that. The one steals a creative idea and scores an amazing job, the other steals a boyfriend and ends up with a baby, people die and they’re brought back together but much has changed. Much keeps changing.  James Grieve’s direction has a firm but tender grip that ensures we’re never marooned from one time-jump to the next, and encourages great performances from Sally Messham’s Lorna and Katie Elin-Salt’s Grace. And as Cook explores out how definitively class affects future prospects and talks about sex, or rather the learning about sex, in an impressive and refreshing manner, you’re left in admiration at the honesty on display from both actors and writer."
439,439,Ought To Be Clowns,17/03/2014,mag9l,Satan Sings Mostly Sondheim, Jermyn Street,"Slotting into a late evening slot at the Jermyn Street Theatre due to the short running time of Away from Home, is this bizarre little comic curio, which feels like it may have gotten lost on the way to Edinburgh. Satan Sings Mostly Sondheim was created by Adam Long, fresh from a successful run of Dickens Abridged which he also wrote and directed, with contributions from Jo Cichonska on the music and it really does have that Festival feel about it, straddling comedy sketch, musical revue and energetic improve session. The set-up, for what it’s worth, is that Satan came up from hell in the 60s, inspired by a great year for musical theatre, and became a star. But his fame is now on the wane and the unresolved issues with his earthbound father has led him to put on a one night only Sondheim special at the Palladium to revive his fortune. Thing is, as the poster says, “this show contains absolutely no music by Stephen Sondheim, and is not endorsed in any way by Stephen Sondheim or anyone who knows him” so Satan and his long-term agent Robert have to make do. This leads directly to the show’s strongest suit. Without the license to the songs he wants to sing, Satan comes up with any number of Sondheim-adjacent ditties, Long and Cichonska having great fun with witty pastiches of the maestro’s inimitable style which hit home time after time. The rest of the show doesn’t quite feel as sharp however, the premise runs out of steam pretty quickly and the writing never quite gets the comic beats it is aiming for, even a Adele Dazeem joke fell flat."
440,440,Ought To Be Clowns,16/04/2016,mag9l,Wipers, Curve,"Wipers – a garbled mispronunciation of Ypres – is a hugely fascinating piece of writing, co-produced by Leicester’s Curve, Watford Palace and Coventry’s Belgrade theatres and pleasingly playing in all three cities. For it is inspired by the real-life story of Khuddadad Khan, the first South Asian soldier to be awarded a Victoria Cross for his bravery in the First World War, where no less than a million South Asian soldiers were active on the battlefield, previously relegated to a footnote in history but rightfully brought to our attention here. Wounded by an attack in the first battle of Ypres that killed most if not all around him, Khan’s resilience held off enemy fire to long enough to protect the remnants of the British forces, among them the four soldiers of this play. Seeking refuge in a barn, they await hoped-for reinforcements, the noises of (the unseen) Khan’s weapon periodically discharging echoing around as they cleave together over a long night. But there’s not just four men, they’re a British officer and three Indian soldiers, with all the tension and torque that brings.  So issues of class structure, both in the UK and on the subcontinent, come into play in the various interactions of the quartet, notions of food and family being touched on beautifully too, over the 10 hours of their wait. Contrasting levels of education and experience give some common ground and others reasons to grudge, and overshadowing it all is the spectre of colonialism and what that means in practical terms for all four of them and what they have to give of their lives. The play may take its time to get going but once fully in its swing, it is delicately powerful and ultimately moving."
441,441,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Murder She Didn’t Write, Leicester Square,"Fresh from sellout success at the Edinburgh Fringe, the folks of Degrees of Error are clearly hoping that their murder mystery show Murder She Didn’t Write will emulate the success of fellow improv stars Showstopper and Austentatious, both of which are now enjoying monthly residencies in the West End. Murder She Didn’t Write’s London debut thus comes at the Leicester Square Theatre and on this hilarious evidence, you wouldn’t put it past them to follow in the footsteps up to Shaftesbury Avenue. Playing out like a cross between a live action game of Cluedo and pure stand-up – this is Poirot on laughing gas.  Insofar as anyone has any control over proceedings, the show is introduced by a detective in search of a case and with a smidge of audience contribution, the scene is set – in our case, it was for ‘The Wet Tea Towel Mystery’. And as we tumble headlong into a 1920ish world with a cast of six, all bets are off as it becomes less whodunnit as whocankeepastraightface. For this is a very funny company indeed and well-drilled in how to make the show work. The six performers are unafraid to push risqué humour and surreal physical work to the limit; having the Inspector act as a director of sorts meant they weren’t allowed to get away with anything (chickens, in space…?!); and whoever was on lighting duty played an absolute blinder in controlling several of the shorter scenes."
442,442,Ought To Be Clowns,08/12/2016,mag9l,Sweet Charity, Royal Exchange," 
I’ve seen a couple of comments questioning whether Sweet Charity is an appropriate choice for the Royal Exchange’s festive musical – I assume they avoided last year’s Into the Woods and the year before’s Little Shop of Horrors, neither show hardly known for their jazz hands and perma-smiles. For the joy of great musical theatre, of any theatre, is when it can find shades of darkness and light in its storytelling, finding a way to reflect the richness of life in its downs as well as its ups. Director Derek Bond (whose Little Shop… remains a stunning high point) acknowledges all of the problems inherent in Neil Simon, Cy Coleman and Dorothy Fields’ tale of a dancer, the titular Charity Hope Valentine, and her repeated, desperate lack of luck in her romantic life and through his interpretation and the directness of Aletta Collins’ choreography, also takes it seriously. Anchored by a properly star-making and heart-breaking performance from Kaisa Hammarlund, it just works. I’ve seen Hammarlund a few times before and have always liked her, but there’s still something gorgeous about seeing a performer with experience taking a well-deserved opportunity and absolutely delivering. Bond’s casting works on all levels though – Cat Simmons and Holly Dale Spencer are pitch-perfect as her co-workers, Daniel Crossley is charm personified as paramour Oscar and Josie Benson brings all kinds of new exciting life to Daddy Brubeck with a corking ‘Rhythm of Life’.  Mark Aspinall’s band sounds like a dream with this score of so many classic songs, James Perkins’ set plays intelligently with the in-the-round configuration of this venue, and the overall feel is inescapably joyous, a testament to Charity’s resilience if nothing else. That’s not to deny that others can find it problematic, but this is how I like my musical theatre, with a tingle in my fingers and a tingle in my feet, especially when Bond is directing."

444,444,Ought To Be Clowns,05/12/2010,Ian,Dick Whittington and his Cat, Lyric Hammersmith,"Dick Whittington and his Cat is the Lyric Hammersmith’s choice of pantomime this year with its ageless tale of a young boy making his way to London to find his fortune. Updating the story slightly to include all sorts of modern references and something of a street sensibility, it does a great job of observing the golden rule of pantomime of keeping its audience engaged and ensuring that the humour contained within hits on all levels, amusing young and old alike, working in slapstick, sight gags, silliness and a fair old bit of smut in Joel Horwood and Morgan Lloyd Malcolm’s excellent script. There’s a steady flow of musical numbers, mainly up-to-the-minute pop songs like Jay-Z and Alicia Keys’ ‘Empire State of Mind’, Katy Perry’s ‘California Gurls’ and Glee’s ‘Don’t Stop Believin’’ featuring lyrical changes to make them London- and Hammersmith –specific. The best of them though is the genuinely funny take on Lady GaGa’s ‘Bad Romance’ by King Rat, Bad Rodent, which both excellently comic and creepy and it is nice to see the amount of effort that has gone into adapting all these songs in an integrated way into the show, rather than making them simple karaoke numbers. Steven Webb’s clean-cut and slightly dim hero Dick is well played, wisely steering clear of too much knowingness around the constant punning around his name, instead offering a fresh appeal that connects directly to the young audience. Rosalind James, fresh off the hugely successful 25th Anniversary Les Misérables tour, is a strong-voiced ballsy heroine as Alice, Nathan Bryon’s Scaramouche is nicely appealing and Simon Kunz is clearly having an absolute ball as the dastardly King Rat. But it is Paul J Medford’s über-cool street-smart Cat who shines through with his enthusiasm and constant interactions with the audience and Shaun Prendergast’s dame in Sarah the Cook who is relentlessly outrageous with dresses that put Lady GaGa to shame, firing out jokes like a machine gun and tossing sweets into the hands of the audience. He builds a great connection with his audience, playing a bit with a couple in the front row and adlibbing brilliantly to a precocious young boy with particular knowledge about gorillas."
445,445,Ought To Be Clowns,11/03/2015,mag9l,The Producers, Churchill Bromley,"There’s little point denying the economic realities of mounting a major tour of a big musical – famous faces sell tickets. That two of the faces on the poster for The Producers belong to Phill Jupitus and Ross Noble feels something of a stretch though, given that they’re playing the same role (the latter taking over from the former mid-May) something of a promotional sleight of hand there that perhaps betrays a lack of confidence in the production. And you can’t help but understand why whilst watching it, and reckoning it is going to be a long four months of a tour. In all honesty, this felt like a misconceived, mis-cast and misunderstood mishap of a mess. Splashing the likes of Jason Manford, Louie Spence and the aforementioned Jupitus against this hugely well-received Mel Brooks musical ought to have been more effective but the Matthew White’s production misses the mark on so many counts. The worst thing is that there are glimmers of goodness in there, mainly located in the performances of theatrical stalwarts David Bedella and Tiffany Graves as Roger De Bris and Ulla respectively. Their natural stage presence and star quality is joyous to behold in their showcase numbers but as soon as they end, the pizazz rushes out of the show like a forlorn deflating balloon. To follow Graves’ excellent ‘Flaunt It’ with the laboured and lazy slapstick routine that inevitably comes feels like an insult. Likewise with Louie Spence’s barely controlled antics as Carmen Ghia. White’s (necessarily?) light touch direction leaves him to prance around in his inimitable style but when such indulgence is followed by the tightly drilled moves of the company delivering another of Lee Proud’s routines, it simply shows him – and thus the production as a whole – up as a fraud. Phill Jupitus’ Franz Liebkind falls into a similar trap of an uninspired retread of a familiar persona, adding nothing vibrant or vital to the show at large.  Perhaps the show will improve throughout the run, finding a better equilibrium between what is expected from TV personalities and what a stage musical actually needs to really work. Not least, Manford will have to learn to deal better with onstage snafus rather than constantly working the gormless rabbit in the headlights look for Bloom, and work on showing more of a personality to engage with English’s proficient Bialystock, a role he’s been understudying, covering and playing for nearly 10 years now."
446,446,Ought To Be Clowns,10/03/2011,Ian,Journey’s End, Richmond Theatre,"Set towards the end of the First World War in the trenches at St Quentin, Journey’s End is a compelling account of life in an officer’s dugout written by RC Sherriff who drew on his own experience there to create this piece of powerfully timeless drama. Never moving from Jonathan Fensom’s tightly designed set, it focuses particularly on Captain Stanhope who is leading this group of officers in the days before the Germans launched one of their fiercest offensives as they reflect back on what has happened, battle through the grim realities of day-to-day life on the front line and contemplate the conflict that lies ahead. David Grindley’s production was first seen in the West End in 2004 and is a masterclass in showing that less can be so much more when deployed with the devastating effectiveness that we see here. One of the play’s recurring themes is the corrosive effect of the endless waiting on the minds of soldiers and officers alike, so much so that one almost longs for something to happen, despite knowing that the order to the front line is an almost certain death sentence. So when that finally happens, the way that the audience is left to make their own conclusions about what is going on in the trenches above from the noise of artillery and bombs whilst watching an empty stage, especially when it is the fate of two of the main characters that lies in the balance, it is an almost unbearable moment. Gregory Clarke’s sound design is perfectly throughout, ever-present but rising to uncomfortable levels as the characters we’re coming to know repeatedly go up to face unimaginable peril above ground and the finale, with the final onslaught represented by a deafening wall of sound which literally shakes the theatre, is a moment of stirring horror that really does leave one stunned. Likewise with so much of the acting: there’s a beautiful restraint to many of the performances which makes them all the more powerful. Tony Turner’s matter-of-fact Private Mason keeping the officers supplied with the meagrest of provisions and a dry wit, yet not hesitating for a second when it’s his turn to go over the top and Graham Butler’s naively keen Raleigh, a new arrival slowly coming to realise that war is no game, was acutely observed. Christian Patterson provides a little (literally) broader comedic touch as an officer highly unsuited to life in the field and James Norton is outstanding as Stanhope, the officer shattered after being thrust into an intolerable situation 3 years ago and barely able to cope with the responsibility of so many lives in his hands. Norton’s performance never lets us forget the upper-class position of this man but makes him all-too-human as a complex character ricocheting between heroic bravura and drunken dismissiveness, all too aware of the heavy duties placed on his shoulders. But it is Dominic Mafham’s avuncular Osborne whose presence is a steadying influence on the men around him and indeed on the audience. His unruffled manner gives us hope that there’s light at the end of the tunnel and the chat with Raleigh before their mission is just beautiful as they reminisce about English country walks, a much-needed moment of calm making his silent breakdown as he struggled to light a pipe just moments before, one of the single most heart-breaking moments I’ve seen in quite some time. The curtain call is beautifully done, honouring those who have gone before, and really does leave one conflicted as to what the appropriate response is. As the soldiers stand motionless, in silence, in front of the names of the fallen, applause feels intrusive, standing would be inappropriate, it really is extraordinarily moving and hard to show the appreciation the company richly deserves. I suppose it is the curse of seeing midweek matinees, and I was glad to see so many school parties being taken to the show, but their whooping jarred badly with the rest of the audience, most of whom were wiping tears from their eyes at this."
447,447,Ought To Be Clowns,27/06/2010,Ian,Avenue Q, Wyndhams,"Now in its third home in the West End in its fifth year altogether, Avenue Q is proving to be something of an enduring success which fills my heart with joy. It is a couple of years since I’ve seen it, but when it first came out I just fell completely in love with the show, and particularly with the opening cast, and ended up seeing it about 5 times in the space of two years. A couple of trips to later incarnations of the cast left me a little disappointed, Jon Robyns, Simon Lipkin and Julie Atherton were just the dream team for me, and plus I ran out of people to take to it, so I hadn’t thought I would go again. However, a visit from a dear musical loving Canadian friend and a slight booking snafu for Wicked with lastminute.com meant we ended up at the half price ticket booth at Leicester Square and we plumped for this familiar old friend. Having seen it so many times and having the soundtrack on my iPod means I know the songs inside out now, but I do maintain that Avenue Q is one of the best new musicals to have been written in the last decade. So many of the songs are classics, instantly catchy and running the emotional gamut from laugh-out-loud funny (so many to choose from but my favourites are probably ‘If You Were Gay’, ‘The Internet Is For Porn’ and ‘Everyone’s A Little Bit Racist’) to tear-in-the-eye touching (the end of ‘Fantasies Come True’, the beginning of ‘It’s A Fine Fine Line’). And they are just so sharp lyrically, full of zippy one-liners and the ring of truth. It was nice to be reminded of so many things I’d forgotten about: just how many jokes pop up Sesame Street style on the little screens; the singing boxes; how funny puppet blowjobs look; the wedding dress and subsequent freakout and above all, just how hard the cast work. In addition to covering at least two main roles, even the leads get in on the supporting action with backing vocals and moves with the aforementioned boxes. Cassidy Janson manages the not inconsiderable feat of following in Julie Atherton’s superlative interpretation and brings her own particular spin to Kate Monster in particular, the opening verse of ‘It’s A Fine Fine Line’ has never been more moving. And I’m not sure if it’s a bug going round but we had understudies on for both Paul Spicer and Tom Parsons. Sam Harrison did extremely well as Princeton with a nice level of warmth and geniality in his performance, though I wasn’t as keen on his Rod who I found a little too screechily camp. But I was seriously impressed with Alan Pearson who was brilliant as Nicky, Trekkie Monster and one of the Bad Idea Bears, looking for all the world as if he does it every night. Elsewhere it was nice to see original Brian Siôn Lloyd back in the cast, and boy does he pack a mightily manly high-five! And whilst Jacqueline Tate’s Christmas Eve was bang on for most of the show, her ‘If You Ruv Someone’ occasionally slipped into perfect legibility, kinda missing the point of the song. The current updating of the end of ‘For Now’ now means it is BP’s turn to get it in the neck which was a nice touch, but it has to be said that some of the Gary Coleman scenes were a little uncomfortable: Delroy Atkinson’s winning performance carried it almost all the way but a couple of moments felt just a little too close to the bone. I couldn’t tell if any lines had been altered and I suppose once we get a bit further from his death it won’t be as much of an issue, but it did feel a little odd to be laughing either at or with him. It was so nice to see this show again after a couple of years, and interesting to see that it affected both me and my companion in a slightly different way to previously: whereas I’d always connected more with it on a career/life perspective, now I’m a little older, I found it had more relevance in its portrayal of relationships. It was still as enjoyable as ever and I hope it continues to run and run. It suits its new home in the Wyndhams very well, it benefits from the greater intimacy there than say the Gielgud, but if nothing else, this is the perfect show to take people who insist that they don’t like musicals to! What a great, affectionate review! Still haven't seen it, so I will definitely go along this summer – just read that it's closing in October … Thanks. And you must go and see it, I really do think it will go down as one of my all-time favourite musicals.I saw that they've announced closing notices too, fingers crossed they might get a last minute reprieve like last time, but I'm not sure. It'll be a shame if it goes though. Saw it on Friday and absolutely loved it! Your review was part of what convinced me to go at last, so thanks for that. http://boycottingtrends.blogspot.com/2010/07/avenue-q-wyndams-theatre-london.html Saw it last week, was my first time and thoroughly enjoyed it – excellent show.  Of all the cast though i felt Cassidy Janson was just amazing, i hadn't heard of her before but will be watching out for her in future."
448,448,Ought To Be Clowns,28/01/2013,Ian,Blood Wedding, New Diorama,"The world of Lorca is naturally imbued with the essence of his native Andalusia, the aching sense of duende that characterises much of his work and at first sight, The Faction’s version of Blood Wedding inhabits a similar realm. Martin Dewar’s lighting casts a warmly Mediterranean haze, guitar strings are plucked from afar and the design is stripped back to a border of sand around the edge of the New Diorama’s stage which has been reconfigured into the round. And in the earthen tones of the costumes, the Cassandra-like Mother foretells a tale of woe between two long-feuding families which are soon to be joined in matrimony in an attempt to force a happy ending. But the heady scent of sexual desire lingers between the wrong people, vengeance lies heavy in the air and there’s a price that must be paid as fate winds its unwieldy way across all concerned. And in their ensemble-led physicality, The Faction – directed here by Rachel Valentine Smith – cultivate the sense of hermetically-sealed community in all its inescapable oppressiveness, ever-present observers from the sidelines and participants in the rituals of marriage. And in the midst of the hustle and bustle, lead performances come shining through. Derval Mellett’s Bride radiates internal chaos beneath her carefully composed exterior as her passions burn for Jonny McPherson’s impressively rugged Leonardo. And Anna-Marie Nabirye’s Mother scorches with a bitter fire, of anger and resignation of the blood-soaked consequences she knows they cannot avoid. And smaller roles impress too: Laura Freeman’s servant, Lachlan McCall’s father, the attention to detail really comes through. But Gareth Jandrell’s new adaptation isn’t always as clear as it could be, especially in some of the directorial choices and given this is a company all relatively similar in age, it is a curious choice of play given the importance of the different generations – The Faction’s stripped-back aesthetic not always helpful here. And though the production starts off rooted in Spain, it doesn’t necessarily carry that Hispanic flavour through. Indeed the music has a folkloric quality that could be ascribed to the gypsies, and the interventions of the strapping Woodcutters and the Moon could come from a strange version of our own British countryside, an idea which takes flight with the striking embodiment of ‘Death as a beggar woman’ calling to mind something of The Wicker Man. This mythical twist makes the second half more engaging than the first despite its inherent strangeness, culminating in a focus on the women left behind as they play cat’s cradle scene and lament their men with desolate wails. "
449,449,Ought To Be Clowns,20/04/2015,mag9l,Who Cares, Royal Court,"The product of eighteen months of interviews with people working in and around the National Health Service, Michael Wynne’s verbatim play Who Cares is an impassioned but clear-sighted cri de coeur for this venerable British institution but one free from too much rose-tinted sentimentality, as it performs an uncompromising health check on that which is meant to check our own health. And the prognosis? The NHS may possibly be screwed but theatre’s in great shape.  Starting off in the rehearsal rooms next to the theatre and eventually ending up in the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs, Who Cares is a promenade production that weaves its way inside and out, up stairs and down, backstage and on, as the audience – split into small groups – take in a multitude of vignettes of the interviewees’ experiences, presented in imaginative and inventive ways by the show’s three directors, Debbie Hannan, Lucy Morrison and Hamish Pirie, plus designer Andrew D Edwards, Natasha Chivers’ lighting and Daniel Krass’ sound. From nurses on a teabreak to surgeons failing at a game of Operation, GPs rattling through their list to cleaners working a grim night shift, these snippets of the NHS in action burst vividly to life in front of us and in such small groups (and in such small spaces, as corridors, stairwells and storerooms), connection to the material is unavoidable. Whether emotionally through our own experiences or more viscerally due to the directness of its delivery, it feels impossible to ignore how integral a part of our society the NHS has been.  Wynne’s shaping of the text also shows us how that position isn’t inviolable as later scenes see us eventually seated to see the trials deconstructing its role in our lives – the cock-ups and cover-ups, the political machinations, the financial realities – and forcing us to ask if our own sentimentality is part of the crisis. At one point we’re asked “is our love of the NHS its biggest problem?” and it is to the production’s credit that no answer is immediately apparent.  The eight-strong cast – Philip Arditti, Robert Bathurst, Elizabeth Berrington, Paul Hickey, Martina Laird, Nathaniel Martello-White, and Eileen O’Brien – are fantastic throughout, covering multiple roles, locations and complete shift in tones with a remarkable fluidity. O’Brien’s emotive nurse-turned-patient is both sensitive and sensationally powerful, Hickey’s Aussie cardiologist a charismatic conduit for showing the baffling decisions behind using ever-more expensive medication, and Berrington’s whistle-blowing campaigner is painfully eloquent even as the establishment bulldozes right over her. "
450,450,Ought To Be Clowns,13/09/2013,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Noël Coward Theatre,"The Michael Grandage Company move onto their fourth show, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the first of two Shakespeares that will finish the season. And given the emphasis of the star wattage that formed the backbone of its publicity, it’s an interesting choice of play due to its ensemble nature and lack of any real star parts. So we get Sheridan Smith in the dual role of Hippolyta and Titania and David Walliams as Nick Bottom the weaver, alongside a company of others many of whom have appeared in previous MGC shows. Grandage’s main conceit is to locate the play in 1960s England, making the magical forest into a festival-like world of hippies and free love, allowing an unambiguous focus on sex as the driving force of the play. It’s more like an Athena model version of sex than the untrammeled passion of the real thing though – the four lovers parade about the forest in various states of underwear-clad undress, Titania’s seductive ways lure Bottom into an off-stage bower, the hints of amour between the Rude Mechanicals left tantalisingly unexplored. That said, it is a most elegant production in Christopher Oram’s classily designed set, dominated by a giant moon, and Paule Constable’s evocative lighting, which nips along at a speedy two hours twenty minutes. The interpretation doesn’t allow for an effective opening – Hippolyta ends up rather neutered in this modern context and Smith flounders a little where a firm sense of her relationship with Pádraic Delaney‘s Theseus ought to emerge. But once the business of setting up the various intertwining plots has been done, Grandage allows the measured magical fun to begin. The romantically entangled quartet – Lysander who loves Hermia who is also loved by Demetrius who in turns is loved by Helena – are genuinely excellent. Susannah Fielding’s scrappy Hermia fizzes with energy and Katherine Kingsley’s Helena – what legs! – is often hilarious as the anguished lover, seemingly also on the run and doubting what is happening. And there’s no pretending otherwise, Stefano Braschi’s Demetrius and Sam Swainsbury’s Lysander are smoking hot, spending most of the play shirtless, trousers unbuckled or off and proving most pleasing indeed for those of us so shallow-minded. They also act well though, revelling in the silliness of their enchanted doings. In the forest, Sheridan Smith makes a vibrant tribal-inspired Titania, warring against Pádraic Delaney‘s Oberon and his knavish sprite Puck, Gavin Fowler full of playful energy. And ironically given the faces on the poster, it is Delaney who delivers the verse-speaking highlights of the night, his unaffected readings capturing so much of what makes Shakespeare so enduringly listenable. As for Walliams, he plays Bottom pretty much as a character from Little Britain though only really overindulges in the death scenes of their show-ending finale. It’s not as painful as I might have expected and it certainly went down a storm with many around me. For me though, more interesting were the hints of a relationship between him and Richard Dempsey’s fabulous Peter Quince, both fighting over the taut body and attentions of Alex Large’s Francis Flute."

452,452,Ought To Be Clowns,18/12/2012,Ian,My Fair Lady, Crucible,"‘Tis a truth that ought to be universally acknowledged that some of the best musicals in Britain are being produced outside of London. Places like Chichester Festival Theatre and Leicester Curve are regularly coming up with the goods, but one of the most reliable of regional theatres has been Sheffield’s Crucible and under Daniel Evans’ stewardship, their Christmas shows have become absolute must-sees. Last year’s Company was sensational, the year before Me and My Girl blew me away and this year, Lerner and Loewe’s all-time classic My Fair Lady gets a long awaited revival and it is a show I have never seen before on stage. One of the lovely things about seeing well-known songs in their original context is that it can refocus the lyrical meaning. For me this was most apparent in the utterly gorgeous rendition of ‘I Could Have Danced All Night’ by Carly Bawden – rather than the grand set-piece I think I was expecting, it’s an understated exhalation of wonderment at the evening just passed and Bawden is gorgeous in it. The large-scale numbers do come though: ‘Get Me To The Church On Time’ is delivered with the highly charismatic Martyn Ellis at the front and soon turns into a cracking fest of tap-dancing; ‘With A Little Bit of Luck’ has a subtler but no less impressive appeal; and ‘Wouldn’t It Be Loverly’s’ hopeful charm had me at ‘ello. Paul Wills’ set is just glorious, a revolving rear wall switches between the book-dominated, professorial bachelor pad of Higgins’ study and a stunning pavilion which somehow manages to serve as all the other locations more effectively through Tim Mitchell’s superb lighting design. This frees up much of the thrust stage’s floor space for Alistair David’s choreography to play out, which is definitely strong yet not always truly inspired as it occasionally feels a little traditional where a fresh take might have offered more of a lift. And it was hard to shake the feeling that the second half takes a long time to get where it is going. It could probably have benefitted from a little trimming as the book stretches out a little thinly and it struck me that poor old Freddie gets rather short shrift as a curiously under-developed character. Then of course there’s the sexual politics. This production does well to address this by making West’s Higgins very much a product of his cloistered educational upbringing, his attitudes are as much to do with class than gender and, I thought, unknowing rather than overtly malicious and the sustained final beat of the show suggests that whatever happens next, it will be far from plain sailing. West makes an appealing Higgins, his enthusiasm for the task in hand palpable, even as its blinkered unfeelingness threatens to derail the whole experiment, and his speak-singing voice perfectly passable. Carly Bawden genuinely is excellent as Eliza though, a proper star-making performance which builds on the work she has been doing in more daring shows like The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Pippin. And as we’re coming to expect from Sheffield now, the supporting cast is excellent. The aforementioned Ellis is brilliant as Eliza’s father Alfred, whose circumstances change almost as much as his daughter’s; Anthony Calf’s Colonel Pickering is a model of public-schoolboy Englishness, as warmly enchanted with Eliza as anyone; Nicola Sloane’s starched Mrs Pearce is always a lovely presence and Richenda Carey sparkles as Higgins’ mother, a woman fully equipped in the ways of man-management, especially that of her stubborn son. The first half of this production is sheer musical theatre heaven: the hit rate of the show is just sensational and Nigel Lilley’s band sounds wonderful throughout. It is perhaps not unsurprising that it doesn’t quite carry the same momentum over through the second half, but we’re talking about dropping from a 5 star to a 4 and a half star rating if I did such things. Some might call this a guilty pleasure but for me, there is no guilt at all – just proudly unashamed joy that Sheffield Theatres and Daniel Evans have done it once again. Book now."
453,453,Ought To Be Clowns,26/06/2014,mag9l,The Valley of Astonishment, Young Vic,"I’ve often been guilty of saying ‘oh I could listen to her read the telephone book’ about any number of the actresses I love and if you’re a fan of the strange enticing melody of Kathryn Hunter’s voice and fancy listening to her reciting a load of numbers, then you (and me) are in luck. In The Valley of Astonishment she plays Sammy Costas, a woman with synaesthesia – a neurological condition that manifests in sensory confusion – and something of an eidetic memory which proves as much of a blessing as a curse as an attempt to exploit it in a variety show backfires. And gathered around her are other stories from people with the same condition, snippets from other lives and the ways in which they have invariably learned to cope which are interwoven into the progression of Sammy’s narrative although in all honesty, I felt they added little. Peter Brook’s name inspires a hushed reverence in many but if someone were coming to him for the first time with this production, it is hard to imagine that they would be equally inspired for it is a rather dry treatment of what is an endlessly fascinating subject."
454,454,Ought To Be Clowns,01/03/2012,Ian,The Lady from the Sea, Rose Kingston,"Recent weeks have seen a couple of instances where theatre has successfully challenged my preconceptions: A Midsummer Night’s Dream saw me reassess Filter and David Eldridge surprised me with some fantastic writing that really resonated with me in In Basildon. Ibsen however has been a major stumbling block for me – I’ve tried my best, taking in several productions of his work but that connection has never emerged, the reason for his continued popularity completely eluding me. So it would be a lie for to me to say that I went to the Rose Kingston’s new production of The Lady from the Sea with a completely open mind – I was amenable to having my mind changed but it was with a heavy heart that I went there. I’ve seen the play once before – ironically in a version by David Eldridge at the Royal Exchange in Manchester – and it was not a happy experience. Ibsen’s story focuses on the nymph-like figure of Ellida, settled uneasily in a marriage of convenience to Dr Wangel as memories of her past continue to have a strong pull on her. Wangel tries to facilitate resolution by inviting a man from her past to stay but he stirs up great emotional swells that threaten to pull Ellida back to her beloved sea. My main reason for booking in the end was the opportunity to see Joely Richardson on the stage, ticking another member of the Redgrave dynasty off the list, and in some ways I’m glad I did. Her luxurious voice and suggestive mannerisms betray the family connection in the best possible way as she portrays the flightiness and fragility of Ellida extremely well on the wooden planks that cover the expanse of the stage in front of the Turner-esque hued cyclorama that suggests the Norwegian sky. But in a story that I already wasn’t too keen on, matters are exacerbated here by director Stephen Unwin’s self-penned version which overplays the relative lightness (for Ibsen) and moves the production into strange light comedy territory. This has the consequence of lessening the profundity of much of the action, whether the deep emotional pulls that torment Ellida or the grudgingly tolerated maritals come-ons of the ageing tutor who is depressingly the only hope for one of Wangel’s step-daughters. Scenes that ought to catch the breath made the audience laugh and so the emotional narrative is completely skewed."
455,455,Ought To Be Clowns,18/02/2019,Ian,Come From Away, Phoenix Theatre,"I didn’t check the merchandise stand at Irene Sankoff and David Hein’s Come From Away but I wouldn’t be surprised if they were seeing branded tissues, such is the weight of expectation that comes with this musical, set in the days after 9/11. But rather than New York, the show is set more than 2,000 kilometres away in the remote town of Gander, Newfoundland, where 38 planes with 6,579 passengers were grounded in the aftermath of the attacks.  There, in a Canadian town that practically doubled in population overnight, we witness the unfolding of a tragedy but more significantly, the response of a community willing and able to do anything to extend the hand of friendship. Doors are flung open, shoulders proffered, bottles opened, an unquestioned barrage of hospitality seeking to envelop traumatised passengers who had been trapped for hours on their planes (in a pre-social media age remember), only to be released to find out the terrible news. Inspired by the stories of real people, you can’t really help but have your heart warmed at some point. The Bronx resident who can’t believe people leave their doors unlocked, the middle-aged couple who find an unexpected romantic connection, the emotional succour provided by two women who find they are both mothers of firefighters. But the show leaves no stone unturned in its determination to be heart-warming that it occasionally tips too far.  The relentless depiction of the Newfoundlanders as benevolent yokels becomes cloying – the Celtic tinged drums and fiddles of the score demand that you feel good as we progress to the inevitable sequence in a pub. And the determination to show their open-mindedness rings horribly false when a gay couple find themselves welcomed with open arms in the unlikeliest of pubs, a tolerance that isn’t extended to their fellow Muslim passengers, their horrendously worsening experience reduced to just the shortest of scenes.  And ultimately for me, this is part of the main problem with Come From Away. To buy it into here in the UK, you have to surrender to something of the 9/11 mythology, buy into that is acclaimed as its universal message when in reality its a North American one. The 10 years later scene really stands out here, coming too close to suggesting everything is fine now rather than acknowledging the catastrophic changes it has wrought on society. This is to take nothing away from the often excellent work in Christopher Ashley’s production, and its pleasingly diverse cast (in body type as well, for once). Kelly Devine’s musical staging is beautifully fluid, Beowulf Boritt’s scenic design allows for speedy but elegant shifts of locations, and performance levels are excellent – Jenna Boyd, Nathanael Campbell, David Shannon and Rachel Tucker all standing out, Cat Simmons too."
456,456,Ought To Be Clowns,09/08/2017,Ian,Coming Clean, King’s Head’s Queer Season,"Between the news of its forthcoming move and expansion and the opening of a major nine week Queer Festival, there’s quite the buzz around the King’s Head at the moment, so I was keen to get stuck into the latter with a double bill of Kevin Elyot’s Coming Clean and a new play called Funeral Meats by Cradeaux Alexander. The late Elyot is having a bit of a moment in London theatre. His final play – Twilight Song – is receiving a belated premiere at the Park Theatre and this production of Coming Clean marks the first major London revival for his first play, since it opened at the Bush in 1982. Thus the opportunity is there, should you wish to take it, to track the evolution of his writing, long dominated by his most famous play My Night With Reg. In terms of recent gay history, Coming Clean is instantly dated as a pre-AIDS play but its emotional world is one that still resonates strongly. We may be in a time here of cottaging and discos rather than Grindr, but the questions around open relationships remain the same, how to balance faithfulness with the freedom to fuck around. And it is the shifting feelings around the rules Tony and Greg have set up for themselves that Elyot investigates here. The catalyst is the arrival of Robert, a hot young would-be actor who they employ as a cleaner, whose presence forces Tony in particular to confront how happy he is with their set-up. Lee Knight plays these insecurities beautifully, particularly in his scenes with Elliot Hadley as his friend William, funny dialogue fizzing like pop between the pair of them, serving as a foil for the painful honesty that they share too."
457,457,Ought To Be Clowns,11/06/2011,Ian,The Roar of the Greasepaint, The Smell of the Crowd,"There ought to be clowns and indeed there were, six urchin-types all done up in Pierrot costumes, an ever-present chorus observing the almost Beckettian power dynamics between the two main characters who are constantly playing and replaying the age old game of life. What might surprise is that this is the set-up for a musical, The Roar of the Greasepaint The Smell of the Crowd with book, music and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, perhaps best known for their collaboration on the soundtrack to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Upper class ‘Sir’ is always in change of the game and is constantly changing the rules so that working-class Cockney ‘Cocky’ is always kept down-at-heel: the plays aims for a metaphysical representation of the 1960s British class system, replete with a sprinkling of absurdist touches that try to enliven the grindingly repetitive nature of the game-playing. But the story is accompanied by a musical score which encompasses a number of songs which may be incredibly familiar to you: standards like ‘Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)’ and ‘Look At That Face’, ‘The Joker’ – recognisable as the theme tune for hilarious television show Kath and Kim and also from Shirley Bassey’s Greatest Hits (or maybe both…!) and ‘Feelin’ Good’, immortalised by Nina Simone’s flawless interpretation. And it is a stark contrast between book and music. Matthew Ashforde’s likeable everyman makes Cocky an appealing figure, whilst Oliver Beamish’s oily sense of entitlement as the controlling Sir is well pitched with the air of menace never too far away, especially in the approach to the interval. Brief cameos from characters like The Girl and The Bully are simply tools to allow Sir’s continued oppression, but when the free spirited The Negro (the show showing its age somewhat) actually enters the Game and challenges the class conventions, there’s only one place the story can go. But the songs seem firmly rooted in the music hall tradition and more often than not, didn’t have that organic sense of being integral to the show or vital to the storytelling. That said, there are some brilliant tunes in there, eminently hummable and Terry Doe’s ‘Feelin’ Good’ backed by harmonising urchins and Ashforde’s ‘Who Can I Turn To’ are both great moments. Tim Goodchild’s design is probably one of the best currently in London, utilising the natural curve of the room to create a miniature faded Big Top with a boardgame painted on the floor and ladders all around adding an extra dimension. Ross Leadbeater’s musical direction from the keyboard remained sensitive to the need not to overpower (never easy in such an intimate space) and the team of urchins were well-drilled in both their choreographic and singing contributions. A strangely curious piece to be sure, but one with enough intrigue and tunes to commend."
458,458,Ought To Be Clowns,16/12/2009,Ian,The Misanthrope, Comedy,"Try as I might, I was hoping not to be too misanthropic about this production of The Misanthrope, but all the talk of misanthrophy has left me somewhat of a misanthrope myself. It was one of those difficult experiences where it was hard to work out whether I really hadn’t enjoyed the play or if it was just the general experience of the most fidgety couple in the world in front of us forcing a constant search for a decent view, the realisation that we’d actually got quite poor seats despite being expensive (£35 for 3rd row of Royal Circle) and the feeling that we were the only sober people at the party, such was the raucous laughter at every other line. Either way, I was perilously close to leaving at the interval, but stuck it out to the end. Molière’s Le Misanthrope has been translated and updated to modern-day here by Martin Crimp and follows Alceste (Damien Lewis) a disenchanted playwright whose resolution to reject society and all its hypocrisy and shallowness, is challenged when he falls in love with Jennifer (Keira Knightley), a fame-hungry American filmstar. A timeless enough story, but one made problematic by the unlikeability of Alceste and Lewis’ performance which I found at times to be insufferable. Part of the problem is also in the script though: this is an incredibly self-aware translation, stuffed full of cultural references and one particularly galling joke about people paying £50 to see any old shit on the stage. For me, this just led to a form of mugging on the stage, Lewis might have well have just said ‘nudge nudge wink wink!’ at times. It’s written in verse with rhyming couplets appearing every so often, which jarred at first but one soon becomes accustomed to it, but I did not like the constant heavy-handed references back to the source which was exacerbated by the performance of much of the second half in French period costume. It’s under the auspices of a fancy dress party, but it just felt to me like a copout: if you’re going to update Molière, then just do it, there’s no need to signpost it this heavily throughout the performance. Acting-wise, it was nice to see Tara Fitzgerald get something to do with a few meaty scenes, after being somewhat sidelined in A Doll’s House earlier this year, and I rather liked Tim McMullan’s critic-turned-wannabe-playwright, desperate for approval. And Keira Knightley was good, with a consistent, passable American accent and an easy feel to her presence on the stage. Indeed there are no weak links in the cast which is commendable, but due to the material, I felt there was precious little opportunity for them to really shine."
459,459,Ought To Be Clowns,24/08/2010,Ian,The Habit of Art, National Theatre,"Given how much theatre I like to get to see, it is very rare that I go to see plays for a second time, much less those with which I wasn’t wholly enamoured first time round, but circumstances conspired to get me back to the Lyttleton with an old friend from far away to see Alan Bennett’s The Habit of Art. The show has returned with a new cast for a brief residency here before a nationwide tour, taking in 9 cities in the UK. You can read my thoughts on the original production here but I’ll quickly recap here for you. Through an imagined meeting between WH Auden and Benjamin Britten, Bennett’s canvas covers a huge range of issues, the nature of creativity and what to do when the inspiration stops, following these two artists dealing with their homosexuality and growing old in their own ways. It also looks at the ethics of biography, the role of the National Theatre and the generation of all kinds of arts, so weighty stuff! When it works it is brilliant, but it must be said there are also times when it doesn’t quite click. Fortunately this time round the audience felt much more responsive to the material, laughing heartily in places for sure but also just chuckling at time, recognising that not every single line Bennett pens is a comic masterpiece (the braying audience from my last visit was so annoying that it is the first thing that comes into my head when I think about this play!), indeed some of the lewd humour is borderline distasteful. And whilst it is funny and undoubtedly well-written, there’s an emotional distance here which I find hard to overcome. The structural conceit puts layer upon layer over the poignancy of the central encounter and I am not sure that this is to the play’s advantage. As the leads, Barritt has the harder job in trying to locate the likeability in the irascible Auden but does well. I actually think I enjoyed his performance more than Richard Griffiths’ but mainly because I was not familiar with Barritt so had no preconceptions. But Sinclair as the starched Britten is just brilliant and plays his other parts with a great flourish: I didn’t think he would match Alex Jennings’ portrayal, but he was pleasingly just as good. In the ensemble, I counted three returnees but the principals are all new arrivals. Leads aside, Selina Cadell brings a wonderful wry weariness to her stage manager and Luke Norris’ appealing rent boy are both excellent and I enjoyed Matthew Cottle’s harried biographer Humphrey Carpenter, although it did feel a little like ‘can we cast someone who looks as much like Adrian Scarborough as possible’! The set is still a brilliantly cluttered rehearsal room and the ensemble seem to have gelled together strongly already which can only bode well for the rest of the tour. I actually think that I enjoyed it more this time round, probably due to the distance from the hype and my familiarity with the material meaning my expectation level was more reasonable and I could appreciate it for what it is, rather than what I wanted it to be (ie another History Boys!) I saw it twice with the original cast, and my experience was exactly the same – I enjoyed it a fair bit the first time but not as much as the rest of the audience… that forced over-laughter is so annoying. Sondheim seems to attract that kind of audience as well sometimes. (Sorry if I sound incredibly snobbish here, I don't mean it like that!) Second time, the final show with the original cast, was much better – more emotional, funnier, etc. – I think the play is better second time, as you said when you don't have unrealistic expectations. And, probably since it was their last show, the cast were really giving it their all – Richard Griffiths was ad-libbing all over the place! – Rob (3rdspearcarrier on Twitter)"
460,460,Ought To Be Clowns,13/05/2014,mag9l,NewFoundLand, Royal Court,"The fun of play readings is often getting to see actors you don’t see so frequently on stage and so it was with NewFoundLand which offered the opportunity to see Kieran Bew return to the theatre. Neil Coppen’s play is part of the Royal Court’s South Africa season, marking 20 years of democracy by pulling together a week of readings with a panel discussion, a live poetry evening, featuring top spoken word artists from South Africa and a late night music event. As the plays are presented as works-in-progress, I won’t say a huge amount about it other than to say it made for a fascinating 80 minutes exploring, amongst other things, gay sexuality, inter-racial relationships, the intersections of race and religion for different cultures and a deeply interesting look at how memory can be tinkered with. A strong cast were directed well by Simon Godwin and as lead character Jacques, Bew was most enjoyable to watch, even if someone saying the above-mentioned quote to him stretched credulity somewhat!"
461,461,Ought To Be Clowns,04/09/2015,mag9l,Song from Far Away, Young Vic,"It’s hard not to be seduced by Ivo van Hove’s Toneelgroep Amsterdam once you’ve experienced them one way or another – there’s a reason I keep travelling to the Netherlands to see them work – and not even Simon Stephens is immune. Having previously adapted Ubu for the company, he has now written monologue Song from Far Away specifically for one of their ensemble members, Eelco Smits, who performs it here at the Young Vic in English. 34 year old banker Willem has relocated to New York but is called back to his native Amsterdam when his younger brother dies. In a haze of casual sex with Brazilians, numerous glasses of Scotch and ginger and disorientating encounters with strangers, his journey back to a family, a home, a country he had abandoned is sketched out through a series of letters he writes to the brother he barely knew whilst coming to realise he barely knows himself. Smits is sensational without ever being showy, the way in which his understated, almost conversational lightness is savagely undercut by unexpected explosions of anguish is hugely affecting, its rawness stripping back the protective layers Willem has built up. These layers are physical as well as metaphorical, this is naked grief in every sense of the word as he recoils from the shock of what it does to his parents, the relationships with his other family members, the former lover he reaches out to. And there is stunning work from Jan Versweyveld’s design and lighting, playing with shadows as much as light in the functional hotel room set. What he achieves with one floor lamp is astounding – warm light flooding out from below, subtly cooler light radiating from above, and yet still enough shade for Willem to periodically dissolve into the anonymity he so craves, the darkness cradling his naked form, shadows juddering across the stage like ghostly fragments of the past."
462,462,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2020,Ian,Augmented Chinatown 2.0, Chinese Arts Now,"You have to admire an arts festival that is determined to push boundaries and with Augmented Chinatown 2.0, the Chinese Arts Now Festival is certainly doing that. Download the app onto your phone and a brave new world of augmented reality, specially commissioned music and audio drama is yours, as you’re taken on a walking tour around London’s Chinatown. It’s a bold and expansive project and as with many technologically-forward things, some aspects work better than others. Playwright Joel Tan’s script is beautifully composed, blending historical detail with socio-cultural commentary to delve into the layers of these Soho streets, of which Chinatown is just the latest. It really does manage that wonderful trick of making you see familiar sights anew (look out for those floor mosaics!). At various points on the tour, you have the opportunity to stop and listen to miniature hyper-local audio plays and these are the moments when the augmented reality comes into play. It takes a little getting used to, building strange forests or 60s nightclub vistas or rows of beautlful poppies and in some ways, it can distract a little from listening properly to the dramas."
463,463,Ought To Be Clowns,17/02/2015,mag9l,Arcadia, Churchill Theatre Bromley,"With London audiences pondering The Hard Question and struggling to find the answer (we’re insufficiently classicly-educated apparently, though the journalist getting the name of the play wrong here is hardly a great start to counter that assertion) fans of Tom Stoppard can also catch his more celebrated play Arcadia in this English Touring Theatre and Theatre Royal Brighton co-production, directed by the ever-interesting Blanche McIntyre. I hesitate to call it a nationwide tour as it doesn’t appear to heading any further north than Birmingham but it is still a healthy enough trek for this pleasingly complex but affecting play. As is customary with this playwright, it is a play full of weighty ideas – complex mathematics and chaos theory, entropy and existential truths, and takes place in the same country house drawing room in two time periods simultaneously, 1809 and the present day. Along the length of a fine dining table, the past rubs up against the present as the scientific rigour of the intellect goes head to head with the emotional poetry of the soul as Stoppard ultimately explores what it simply means to be human (and also what stirring rice pudding really represents). It is perhaps easy to get caught up in the density of the detail during the play but it would take the hardest of hearts not to be swept up the heart-breaking swing and sway of the final scene. McIntyre deals with Stoppard’s intelligence with an understated delicacy which may come across as an unadorned simplicity at times, especially in the first half which does have its longueurs, but which equally allows audiences an uncomplicated route to the production’s heart. More detail in Jonathan Fensom’s design or more flashiness from Johanna Town’s lighting would detract from the matter at hand and even in the staging around the immutable table, there’s a gentle reminder that this is theatre for the ear as well as the eye, a play that demands to be listened to carefully as well as appreciated by the eye. You could put pretty much any man in riding boots and a tailcoat and I’d pay attention (hello Tom Greaves) but Wilf Scolding’s Septimus Hodge really is possessed of an exceedingly charming manner that perfectly captures the spirit of this increasingly amorous tutor. Dakota Blue Richards as his pupil, the astonishingly intelligent Thomasina makes a beguiling stage debut which builds on the prescient brilliance of her Lyra from the film adaptation of The Golden Compass, and Kirsty Besterman is a terrific hoot as the lady (Bracknell) of the nineteenth century house. And Robert Cavanah and Flora Montgomery beautifully illuminate the modern day scenes with real dynamism. "
464,464,Ought To Be Clowns,28/10/2013,Ian,Love Story, Jack Studio Theatre,"Howard Goodall and Stephen Clark’s lush musical take on Erich Segal’s perennial tearjerker Love Story gained critical if not commercial success with its West End run back in 2010, but its beautiful music can now be heard live again with its off-West-End premiere at the Jack Studio Theatre in Brockley. It was always a chamber piece and so it suits the intimacy of this fringe venue well and in Joseph C Walsh’s clever and unmiked production, it provides a welcome reminder of one of the best new British musical scores of recent times. But though it is musically excellent, the book does contain issues and they are sadly all-too-apparent in this interpretation. The story telescopes the entirety of Jenny Cavilleri and Oliver Barrett IV’s five year relationship, from its spiky college beginnings through marriage beds and [spoiler alert, although not really…] hospital beds to its tragic end, into 90 minutes of fast-flowing narrative and song. But it is so fast, so relentless, that it is difficult to really invest emotionally into the characters as they are written here – the show thus relies on pre-knowledge of the story and from the transcendent strength of the performances (Emma Williams and Michael Xavier both excelling in this respect in the West End). Whilst the first of these is out of his control, Walsh is responsible for the second, and there are mixed results. Caroline Keating’s Jenny is superb (and the introduction of the character is a brilliant moment), a feisty New York Italian pianist equally adept with tossing off wisecracks or demonstrating a gorgeous musicality. But Jonny Muir never really seems at home as alpha male Oliver, ice hockey star and scion of New England society, lacking the inherent authority of those born to wealth and the charisma of a man who usually gets what he wants. They do sound lovely when singing together, it just feels like Muir would be more at home in a role like Avenue Q’s Princeton which would play more to his strengths."
465,465,Ought To Be Clowns,26/02/2011,Ian,Contact U.K., Soho Theatre,"This isn’t a review of this show, Contact U.K., as it was a table reading of this new play by Michael Kingsbury which took place at the Studio on the top floor of the Soho Theatre, but more of a note for myself for completeness to my record of theatre-going and also, hopefully, the smugness I can have when/if this show makes it to the stage: I can say that I filled out a rather amusing feedback form and helped shape its progress! I can’t deny that the cast involved played a big part in me wanting to attend to: Tara Fitzgerald is just wonderful full stop, Michelle Ryan is proving herself to be quite the versatile actress and Rupert Graves has a special place in my period-drama loving heart (hello Maurice!). Iain McKee made up the fourth cast member, recognisable to those of you who’ve seen Channel 4’s The Promise and we even got some bonus John Sessions as the narrator which was a pleasant surprise. The play is a comedy, bordering on a black comedy, about a well-to-do Islington couple, an industrial psychiatrist Matthew and his marketing consultant wife Naomi, Graves and Fitzgerald, who have placed a advert for some cheeky wife-swapping fun. The couple they’ve agreed to meet are the younger Ryan and Kelly, from somewhere on the Walworth Road, worlds apart in outlook, prospects and aspirations, but the one evening of sexual antics that they all sign up for risks becoming something more as the agreement they made gives way to the sexual and economic needs and desires that are awoken in these two very different couples. My own feedback was that it was well done as two halves but more could be done to feed through some of the suggested darkness in the first half, making it more of a black comedy from the outset and pushing it more into the realms of psychological drama towards the end, but that would change the nature of the play and that isn’t necessarily what they’re looking for! One conceit is to have Matthew be one of the architects of the ‘Big Society’ thinking which lends it an extreme modishness which I suspect they might be better getting rid of as who knows how this policy will roll out over the coming years of this Coalition administration as it is fearsomely unpopular (I should add that I have strong connections through work to this so am not unbiased in this) and allying itself so closely to something when it doesn’t actually need to might hamper its perception by the general public."
466,466,Ought To Be Clowns,06/12/2016,mag9l,Once In A Lifetime, Young Vic,"The end of the silent movie era and the arrival of the talkies has proved fertile ground for many a storyteller, not least Betty Comden and Adolph Green’s immortal Singin’ in the Rain, but Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman’s Once In A Lifetime has a serious claim to being one of the first, premiering as it did in 1930 and its influence is plain to see. It has received major revivals from Trevor Nunn at the RSC (1979) and Edward Hall at the National (2005) and now it is the turn of Richard Jones at the Young Vic, in a production notable for marking the theatrical stage debut of Harry Enfield. In a new adaptation by Hart’s son Christopher, Once In A Lifetime follows the trials and tribulations of three workaday vaudeville artists from New York who decide to throw in their lot and ship out to Hollywood. With the first ever talking motion picture doing great business, they opt to capitalise on the trend by opening an elocution school to help all those actors who suddenly need to speak on screen but even in its earliest days, the crowded corridors of Tinseltown prove a tough nut to crack with any number of wannabe starlets, studio heads and screenwriters competing for the limelight. It has all the makings of a classic screwball comedy but strangely, it is played at half the pace. The (somewhat thin) plotting is full of farcical shenanigans but Jones’ production is elegant rather than energetic, typified by Hyemi Shin’s gorgeously conceived set which shifts effortlessly from its opening widescreen cinematic aspect to its gliding revolve of near-art installation beauty. So the play proceeds here as a gentle comedy rather than a raucous farce or a biting satire – it is by no means fatal, I did enjoy myself after all, but it was a night of chuckles as opposed to all-out belly laughs. What does shine through is the quality of the superb company. A never-better Claudie Blakley is wonderfully wise-cracking as May, partnered by Kevin Bishop’s Jerry and a marvellously understated John Marquez as the hapless George who somehow manages to completely defy the odds. Enfield is good value for money as the movie mogul they need to charm, Adrian der Gregorian multi-roles vividly and Lucy Cohu sizzles as garrulous and glamorous gossip columnist Helen Hobart in an array of absolutely stunning costumes and wigs – full credit to Nicky Gillibrand and Cynthia De La Rosa respectively."
467,467,Ought To Be Clowns,11/03/2017,mag9l,In Other Words, Hope Theatre,"In Other Words isn’t the first play to make me cry this year but it is the first one to make me sob. I had tears running down my face for about two thirds of the running time, just about held back the ugly crying by not saying anything to friends as I dashed out of the Hope Theatre, and then I sobbed all the way down Upper Street and the Victoria line (thank to the lady who offered me a tissue, Londoners aren’t all bad you know), completely emotionally broken. Dementia is one of those subjects that just gets me right there (in not unconnected news, it won’t surprise you that I couldn’t bear to watch Amour in a cinema or that I find Judy Parfitt’s work in Call the Midwife as Sister Monica Joan deeply affecting). And based as it is on the playwright’s studies into the condition and the extraordinary way in which sensory stimulation – particularly playing music – can sometimes find a way through it, Matthew Seager’s In Other Words is a deeply sincere and moving play. It tells the story of the lifelong love between Arthur and Jane, from their meet-cute in a bar over some spilled red wine, through 50 years, to the residential care home where she dutifully visits the man who has become a shadow of her husband. And throughout, we flash on vignettes of their story, recalling happy memories as well as difficult ones, the power of a Frank Sinatra song to salve any bumps in their relationship, the heavy weight of dread increasing as the realities of a fading memory become starkly apparent. Paul Brotherston’s production has the couple narrating this story to us, which provides a useful periodic break from the emotional intensity as well as deepening the storytelling. And it is remarkably intense, extraordinarily bold light (Will Alder) and sound (Iida Aino) design spare us nothing in the episodes where they suggest something of the disorienting clamour afflicting Arthur, and even in their subtler moments remain crystal clear about the dark and disquiet that Alzheimer’s wields over people. Seager plays Arthur with real charm and warmth, tracking his haunting deterioration with sensitive skill. And Celeste Dodwell gives the kind of shattering performance that sears itself into the mind as Jane. Determined to support her husband through thick and thin, through the impossibility of trying to remain positive in the most desperate of situations, her most powerful moment is the unspoken collapse on her face during an appointment with the doctor, where you see her realising like a hammer blow that she has to turn from wife to carer."

470,470,Ought To Be Clowns,05/11/2010,Ian,Love Love Love, Royal Exchange Studio,"After taking the soon-to-be-renamed-Dorfman Cottesloe at the National Theatre by storm this summer, Mike Bartlett has another new play in theatres, Love Love Love. A co-production between Paines Plough and the Drum Theatre Plymouth, it is currently touring smaller spaces in some of the country’s top regional theatres: I saw it in what marked my first visit to The Studio at Manchester’s Royal Exchange. Three acts, set in 1967, 1990 and 2011, take us through a relationship born in the heady world of the baby boomers ready to change the world, to their struggle to deal with the mundane responsibilities of middle-aged family life, through to the oblivious contentment of retirement. Bartlett’s sharp eye is focused here on responsibility, both social and personal, ultimately pitting generations against each other as today’s have-nots place the blame for the state of the world today on their predecessors’ shoulders, as an unfulfilled daughter rails about unfairness against her parents. Kenneth and Sandra are the central couple whose single-minded approach to life and the pursuit of individual happiness is played out with a forthright directness which takes no prisoners at all, crushing the possibilities of even those closest to them. Whether it is their children or Kenneth’s brother, no one is allowed to stand in the way of what they want with darkly comic, and often devastating, effects. John Heffernan is phenomenal as Kenneth with a remarkably subtle performance; from his scruffy bare-chested student making off with his brother’s girl to his sharp-suited but crumpled businessman to his mellow linen-trousered retirement, there’s a geniality to his portrayal even in the most selfish moments, a slight look of the haunted about him as if he knows the damage he is doing but can’t help himself. Daniela Denby-Ashe’s more self-obsessed Sandra though has no such compunction, barreling through life taking what she wants, swigging wine from the bottle and it is great fun. Denby-Ashe gets many of the best lines but delivers them so well with a most assured performance, always keeping Sandra a morbidly fascinating character. As their children, Rosie Wyatt is given the pick of the supporting characters with her tortured teenager moving into disillusioned adulthood with accomplished ease and James Barrett’s Jamie is moving in near-wordlessly depicting the impact of events on him. Simon Darwen’s Henry, Kenneth’s brother, is delightful: a great counterpoint to Kenneth, harking back to their parents’ generation despite only being 4 years older and it is probably the play’s main (possibly only) weakness that his character disappears unsatisfactorily after Act 1, garnering only two mentions in passing later on. Lucy Osborne’s design is ingeniously executed given the requirement to cover three distinct time periods, budgetary constraints and that this is a touring show: lots of nice period detailing (I loved the proper 90s hi-fi) and judicious use of costume design too. Seeing Love Love Love makes me really wish I could watch Earthquakes in London again to reassess it in the light of Bartlett’s body of work and to compare the two more directly: I feel like this is a much more devastatingly effective indictment of the baby boomers as it is a more tightly focused work, but it also benefits from giving a compelling voice to that generation, allowing them to damn the sense of entitlement that has provoked so much of this outrage. Bartlett’s ear for dialogue remains sharp and true and as deliciously witty as ever but where this play is particularly strong is in its impeccable character work, tracing the developments in personality over time, over 40 years in some cases, showing the changes and the similarities, the subtle and the obvious, in a completely believable way. And in tackling his subject matter with such acuity and making it so powerfully relevant, Mike Bartlett continues to be one of the most exciting playwrights in the country. Thanks for this review: I cannot wait to see this in Bath and then it is bound to come into London after that I reckon. Me too, John Heffernan is foxy!! Hehe, he's a bit ginger for me, but I do think he is an excellent actor and one to watch for the future. I'm not sure that it will necessarily transfer despite the good write-ups. I've heard that Paines Plough have said they don't intend to bring this production to London"
471,471,Ought To Be Clowns,16/03/2014,mag9l,West End Recast, Duke of York’s,"There doesn’t seem to be a Sunday night that passes without some concert or another featuring a host of West End stars celebrating a composer or honouring a good cause and this weekend was no exception. West End Recast saw performers taking the chance to embrace roles that they would normally not be cast for, crossing gender and colour lines for a hugely entertaining couple of hours and some brilliant singing. The evening saw an interesting diversity of interpretations of the brief but predominantly, the feel was that it wasn’t so radical an approach – good songs are good songs no matter who sings them.  Some performers went for straight-forward renditions (Daniel Boys’ ‘Send in the Clowns’, Katie Rowley-Jones’ impassioned Rent double header), several of the boys opted for costumey props with mixed results (Boys teaming up with Leon Lopez for a lovely low-key version of ‘For Good’ complete with tiara and green facepaint, Simon Bailey’s Ariel wig not proving as much as an obstacle to ‘Part Of Your World’ as his simpering delivery which flew in the face of the musical integrity pretty much everywhere else). But I have to say I preferred the moments that felt genuinely subversive with their gender-flips and the performances that exploded off the stage (or both at the same time). Fresh from The Light Princess, the Laura Pitt-Pulford loaded ‘If I Were A Rich Man’ with a marvellously slinky sexiness that powered gloriously across the stage; Martin Callaghan’s ‘Dance Ten Looks Three’ sparkled with effervescent energy and a sly wink; and Tracie Bennett near blew the roof off the Duke of York’s with a scorching ‘Ol’ Man River’, a truly spectacular moment worth the entrance fee alone. And with others, there was the suggestion that workable productions could actually follow on – Cynthia Erivo utterly convincing whilst giving her best Fanny Brice and Jon Robyns making a case for Dreamboys with a rousing ‘(And I Am Telling You) I’m Not Going’.  And I’ve not even mentioned Emma Williams’ Geordie-tastic ‘Electricity’, Nick Holder’s ‘Defying Gravity’, Frances Ruffelle’s excellent Cabaret medley, it really was that kind of evening, stuffed full of endless treats. Kudos to director Adam Lenson, musical director Daniel A Weiss and producer Amanda Holland for putting together a truly special event. My only real complaint is that we only got a snippet of ‘When I Grow Up’ at the end, the thought of Erivo and Williams sharing the role of Matilda simply delicious.

472,472,Ought To Be Clowns,22/04/2016,mag9l,American Psycho, Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre,"Bigger and bolder, and that’s just the pecs of leading man Benjamin Walker. It’s taken a little while for Rupert Goold’s American Psycho to make it over the pond after its run at the Almeida in the winter of 2013/4. But nothing if not tenacious, it now opens in a remounted and slightly retooled version at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, in a production that is indeed bigger and bolder, brasher too as befits the 80s incarnation of the city in which it now resides. Book-writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa has adapted Bret Easton Ellis’ novel of amorality into a tautly entertaining tale that both mocks the period (was that Donald Trump joke in the original?!) but also subversively questions the whole narrative, asking us how reliable Patrick Bateman is in relaying his tales of natural bedpartners investment banking and serial killing, or whether this uber-narcissist is something of a fantasist too. And underpinning the story is the glossily electronica-heavy score from Duncan Sheik (here’s my review of the recently released London Cast Recording) of which I have to say I am a big fan. Predominantly original songs but interspersed with choral re-arrangements of 80s classics from the likes of Tears for Fears and Huey Lewis and the News, their pop-inflected sheen may take a couple of listens but there’s much self-referential humour here and a certain amount of sexiness too – just listen to the way Walker says ‘ hard body’. It is fascinating to see Walker in the role after Matt Smith made such an impact at the Almeida. Undoubtedly a better singer, he’s certainly more charismatic and seductive but you miss a little something of the dispassion that Smith exuded so effortlessly, even whilst murdering several people in the space of one song in a blood-spattering variety of methods. He’s partnered well by Heléne Yorke as his materialistic girlfriend, Jennifer Damiano’s sweet secretary and Jordan Dean’s besotted Luis."
473,473,Ought To Be Clowns,16/10/2015,mag9l,Memphis, Shaftesbury,"Never one to look a gift-horse in the mouth, the offer of a return ticket to Memphis (the show, not the place sadly) was one I was happy to accept and I was glad for it too. The show remains a hugely impressive showcase for its cast and creatives whilst never quite engaging satisfactorily enough with its subject matter (see my original review here) but the overall effect is certainly one that is entertaining and should set the show up for a successful UK tour in 2016 after it finishes in the West End. The main change has been the arrival of X Factor winner (and stone cold fox – who knew) Matt Cardle in the cast as Huey, replacing Killian Donnelly who has headed over to Kinky Boots. And as a musical theatre debutant, he is very good indeed, slipping into the role of the fast-talking, highly charismatic DJ with great ease, nailing an adorkable charm that is most appealing. It helps that he shares great chemistry with Beverley Knight as rising star Felicia, herself now off to the latest revival of Cats, further cementing her own MT reputation."
474,474,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2018,Ian,Moments & Empty Beds, Hope,"A double bill of short plays by Julia Cranney, Moments & Empty Beds offer up a neatly incisive look at the modern world through the eyes of those whose stories aren’t heard as often as they should. Those having to shoulder the burden of a failing mental health system,  those who bear the brunt of society’s rudeness towards service workers, those who don’t have the support systems in place that so many take for granted. Moments follows the unlikely friendship that blossoms between Ava – in her early twenties and living in London for six months now,  working in a call centre – and Daniel, fifty-something, somehow estranged from his family and paying the bills with a job as a car park security guard (and no, he can’t help you with your ticket). Nothing too much exciting happens in their lives but as they describe the minutiae of everyday life in all its unassuming banality, these details accumulate into a weighty portrait of two ever so slightly desperate souls.  Subtly taking in such weighty subjects as the isolation that too easily accompanies metropolitan living and the huge cost that can come with the revelation of huge personal truths, Moments has the deceptive appearance of being slight but builds into something moving in the hands of Cranney’s intense Ava and Simon Mattacks’ hapless Daniel, both having made big changes in their lives but still struggling to find a place in a world they thought would accept them more readily. (It does ask a lot of a London audience though to believe, that this pair would get the exact same bus every day!) Empty Beds switches focus to a trio of sisters who are on the exact same mode of transport, a train this time, as they travel down to celebrate their younger brother’s birthday. In real time, shared histories and uncertain futures swirl around the carriage as a vivid portrait of sisterhood appears alongside the unique pressures that accompany the particular circumstance that emerges. Director Kate Treadell controls the release of information well and brings in enough dynamism to this essentially static scene that keeps it compelling. A writer, and a company, to look out for."
475,475,Ought To Be Clowns,23/11/2012,Ian,Orpheus Descending, Royal Exchange,"It is often the case with lesser performed works by well-known playwrights that there’s a reason why they don’t occupy the same place in the canon, and so it was with this production of Tennessee Williams’ 1957 play Orpheus Descending which I managed to squeeze into the end of a hectic work trip to Manchester. It is unmistakeably his work: elements like the oppressive heat of the Deep South, repressed passion and a mismatched couple are present and correct. But there’s also a lugubrious pace and a patchwork quilt of superfluous supporting characters which helps to explain its relative obscurity. Lady Torrance is an unhappily married Mississippi store-owner whose head is well and truly turned with the arrival of handsome young drifter Val. He’s escaping his past but finds himself in the most stifling kind of narrow-minded community as they react against him. At the same time though, he offers the potential of a way out for Lady who dares to dream of a more liberated future, but the constraints of her present circumstances and the ever-powerful echoes of the horrific past mean nothing is easy. Though she creates a highly evocative soundscape through Peter Rice’s sound and Trevor Michael Georges’ bluesy music, director Sarah Frankcom sadly does little to address the slow pacing of the play, the first half stretched out interminably as a revolving door of inconsequential characters waft in and out and the plot unwinds incredibly slowly to the point where the lack of connection was a little too visible on the faces of this Royal Exchange audience, the richness of Williams’ lyrical dialogue spread a little too thinly across a too-large ensemble, its nature a little too elusive."
476,476,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Operation Black Antler, Southbank Centre,"When a company sticks the term ‘immersive’ on its marketing copy, it can too often be a wishy-washy attempt to lure its audience in without really making them engage on any meaningful level. There’s no danger of that with Blast Theory and Hydrocracker’s Operation Black Antler though, as your undercover police mission to infiltrate a suspect protest group means you have to get right in there, really challenging yourself to see how far you can, or should, go in the name of national security. So much of the thrill of the event comes from the unknown (is it time for more You Me Bum Bum Train yet?) so no spoilers here, but I will say that there’s something shockingly effective about the set-up, the ease with which one can slip into someone else’s shoes and adopt a voice full of abhorrent messaging, ostensibly for the greater good. You can choose how much or how little you engage with the process but let’s face it, no-one is booking an immersive show to embrace your retiring wallflower side!  I took part in the show a couple of years ago in Manchester, shortly after the Manchester Arena bombing which lent an eerie currency its very raison d’être. Even now though, there’s still such a relevance not only in terms of the society we’ve become but also in the checks and balances on it, the role that the state has to play in protecting us and where the boundaries are in pursuing that objective. But ethical concerns about police surveillance aside, there’s something about human nature here too, the different personas we put on to fit into different groups, that makes you realise how pernicious attitudes to any number of subjects can thrive when one compartmentalises one’s life this way. The choice of venue is particularly apt here, as the lines between real life and theatre are brilliantly blurred, a disconcerting sense of uncertainty pulsing through every interaction – a real credit to all cast and creatives in conjuring such a believable world."
477,477,Ought To Be Clowns,24/06/2018,Ian,Sea Wall, Old Vic,"As is only right with any significant birthday, the Old Vic has been seriously milking their 200th and their latest gift is a two week revival of Sea Wall. The Simon Stephens monologue, written for Andrew Scott, has popped its head up a few times over the last few years, and this is being touted as possibly its final appearance.    Since I’d missed it previously in London and given that its 30 minute running time meant it slotted in quite nicely to a two-show day, I picked up one of the cheaper tickets available (incredibly, prices go up to £80 for this). It was almost worth the money for the pre-show ‘entertainment’ as the audience fell silent a good couple of minutes before the show actually started. And key to Sea Wall’s effectiveness is Scott’s ability to connect so entirely with his audience. Laughing and joking, we’re totally with him in the anecdotes of his ideal life. And slowly but surely, we come to realise just how much we’re in the palm of his hand as he crushes the joy away, leaving the bitter sting of desolate heartbreak."
478,478,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2016,mag9l,The Winter’s Tale, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,"It’s easy to feel a little jaded when it comes to Shakespeare, the same plays coming round with regularity and not always inspiring such great theatre. So I’m delighted to report that Michael Longhurst’s production of The Winter’s Tale for the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse is probably the best version of the play I’ve ever seen. The Kenneth Branagh Company’s The Winter’s Tale was a staid disappointment for me, previously the Crucible had let me down too but in the candlelit atmosphere on Bankside, something truly magical is happening. It’s a tricky play to get right in its split of two very different worlds but where Longhurst really succeeds is in suggesting that Sicilia and Bohemia perhaps aren’t too separate at all. Modern designers often highlight the dichotomy between the chilly stateliness of Leonte’s Sicilia with the freewheeling japery of Polixenes’ Bohemia but in the simplicity of Richard Kent’s design, they’re both very much on the same sliding scale – psychological darkness pervading the light in both worlds, the promise of redemption ultimately illuminating one and the other too. So the Sicilian court brims with life and vigour, characterised perfectly by Rachael Stirling’s supremely gorgeously voiced Hermione in all her vivacity, and only in Leontes’ jealous hands – a powerfully muscular turn from John Light – do the shadows fall as he accuses her of adultery with tragic results. And in Bohemia, James Garnon’s excellent Autolycus (has ever an actor been better at interacting with audiences?) emphasises the nefarious side to this comic criminal as he skirts the fringes of the budding romance between Steffan Donnelly’s Florizel and Tia Bannon’s striking Perdita, 16 years after the events of the first half. Longhurst has cast his play to the hilt and it shows in the quality of every single performance here. Niamh Cusack’s Paulina swoops onto the stage in a Scottish Widows hood but her vengeful watchfulness over Leontes is tempered with an undeniable affection for the royal family, deeply moving in its commitment. Sam Cox and Dennis Herdman are a delightfully affable pair of shepherds, David Yelland’s Antigonus and Fergal McElherron’s Camillo also impress, as do Daniel Rabin and Ryan McKen as the Sicilian gentlemen reporting the scenes of the finale with real wit, even holding their own with Garnon. Throw in the intriguing choreography from Fleur Darkin, Shakespearean sheep are certainly having an interesting time of it!, and a bear that is, well, you’ll have to go and see, this Winter’s Tale builds and builds into something beautiful and deeply emotional. The reunions of the end have surely not been done better than here and the intensity of the acting carries through into the final jig, just watch Stirling and Light sizzle with sensuality ‘til the very end. Absolutely superb work from all concerned and a genuinely exciting revelation."
479,479,Ought To Be Clowns,14/03/2016,mag9l,Mrs Henderson Presents, Noël Coward,"I really enjoyed Mrs Henderson Presents when I saw it last year in Bath, it came 13th out of all the shows I saw in 2015, so I was most delighted to hear that it would be transferring into the West End. It managed the journey with its main cast almost entirely intact, Tracie Bennett, Ian Bartholomew and Emma Williams all there, just Mark Hadfield dipping out to (re)join The Painkiller and replaced by Jamie Foreman, and its opening at the Noël Coward Theatre has been largely very well received.  And second time around, it pleased me just as much as the first. Terry Johnson’s direction of this ineffably British show (as with Andy Capp, playing the spoons is up there with the Union Jack) and from my memory, I don’t think that much has significantly changed (though I’ve seen a lot in the intervening 7 months…). That means that the shonky narrator/compere role is still there, which still wears thin quickly, but it also means that its generosity of spirit and warmth of heart is very much present.  I’d forgotten just how heart-stoppingly beautiful so many moments are in the show. Mrs Henderson’s memory of the man she truly loved gaining corporeal form, Emma Williams and Matthew Malthouse tripping the light fantastic in Andrew Wright’s brilliant choreography, the confidence that grows in the women who gain a strange form of empowerment. And there was more too – Lizzy Connolly is now firmly on my radar after her show-stealing turn in Xanadu and I appreciated her much more this time round and I’ll be darned if Samuel Holmes isn’t peachier than ever…! "
480,480,Ought To Be Clowns,28/08/2009,Ian,Three More Sleepless Nights, National,"Ian Hart (eagerly anticipated by me at least in the forthcoming Speaking in Tongues) and Lindsey Coulson have great chemistry in their opening scene as a long-married long-suffering couple, Frank and Margaret, who argue constantly about his drinking and infidelity and her frustrations. They both give as good as they take and the scene is filled with sharply observed overlapping dialogue which was often very funny. Hattie Morahan and Paul Ready (both fresh from Time and the Conways) had a more difficult job in showing their disconnected couple in the second scene, who despite sharing a bed, seem to occupy completely different planes. Ready’s Pete is affable enough and mines much gentle humour from his relating everything to sci-fi films: he also rocks an amazing set of brown M&S style pyjamas which made me wonder if anyone still wears pyjamas and how lucky I am that I no longer receive them as Christmas presents. But this film chat is clearly a mechanism for avoiding discussing Dawn’s (Morahan) serious issues as she is suffering from panic attacks, questioning whether she is even alive and disturbingly close to self-harm, with Pete seemingly oblivious or simply worn out from dealing with his brittle wife."
481,481,Ought To Be Clowns,16/06/2016,mag9l,Karagula, Styx,"Full disclosure – I saw a preview of Karagula, one which lasted until 11pm and so you may rightly assume that it left me disgruntled. But I’m my own worst enemy sometimes, I’m not the biggest fan of Philip Ridley when he’s erring on the fractured narrative side and I had been warned. But Radiant Vermin was so good, Mercury Fur shines brightly in the memory, and Ridley’s own poetry had left me very well inclined towards him when news of this new production broke. Mounted by D.E.M. Productions and PIGDOG in a location initially kept secret but now revealed as Styx, a converted ambulance station in Tottenham Hale, Karagula is a wildly ambitious thing, claiming to be one of the largest productions ever mounted Off-West-End. And in some ways, you can see it, the attention to detail in some of the costumes, the sheer sweep of the universes that it covers, the audacity of the satire attempted on dissolute Western behaviour patterns. At this stage though, the scale seems a step too far. Fractured narratives of multiple storylines are all well and good when tautly observed, but there’s far too much bagginess in the writing here with a couple of scenes dragging on fatally too long. And you can see where Shawn Soh’s design budget has been tested, in a way that sometimes (knowingly?) recalls classic Doctor Who in its shonkiness."
482,482,Ought To Be Clowns,30/05/2014,mag9l,Life of the Party, Menier Chocolate Factory,"You’d be forgiven for not being familiar with Andrew Lippa, whose work is being celebrated at the Menier Chocolate Factory with a vivacious show that cherry-picks from his career so far. Although born in Leeds, his successes have been over the Atlantic with shows like The Addams Family, Big Fish and The Wild Party which have helped him to build a considerable, if niche, audience. With the help of some classy West End friends though, this sparkling revue could well encourage a further groundswell of popular support in the UK and get Lippa’s work produced here more often.  In the meantime, the concert format works well here with The Life of the Party. Lippa is a born raconteur and from his piano, he is a hugely entertaining presence full of gossipy tidbits but more importantly, brimming with enthusiasm for the world of musical theatre and his continued place in it. Talking about the songs and shows that have made up his oeuvre, there is no mistaking his sheer love for what he does and that brings something extraordinary to the material, an intensity that might not even been matched when the songs are being performed in their natural context within the shows. It helps that those performing the songs are of the calibre that they are here. Lippa indulges himself a few times which is excusable but when Damian Humbley, Caroline O’Connor and Summer Strallen take their turns, they lift the show into something spectacular. The women shine particularly strongly, O’Connor’s take on ‘An Old-Fashioned Love Story’ is a Sapphic sensation and her take on ‘Love Somebody Now’ is a heart-breaking masterpiece. Strallen’s ‘Life of the Party’ is another highlight as Lippa’s lyrical strengths come to the fore matched with a striking performance. "
483,483,Ought To Be Clowns,14/01/2014,Ian,Drawing the Line, Hampstead via livestreaming,"A complete Brucie bonus to start off the year was the unexpected announcement that Howard Brenton’s new play Drawing the Line – a sell-out success at the Hampstead – would have its final performance live-streamed on t’internet. I hadn’t booked for the show as something had to give over Christmas and New Year and so the chance to catch up with it for free, albeit on the screen of my laptop, was one I was glad to take. The play is set in the final days of the empire, as the British are beating a hasty retreat from the subcontinent but are determined to partition the land, and its diverse people, into India and Pakistan. The job of, quite literally, drawing the line falls to archetypal Englishman and judge Cyril Radcliffe who is shipped off to somewhere he has never been before, to accomplish what turns out to be a fiendishly complex assignment.  For the concept of nation-building is no tidy affair, especially in a region filled with different ethnicities and religions, and though the British administration have imposed an intolerably tight deadline, Radcliffe is determined to do as good a job as he can. But he has to face the anger that has built over years of colonial oppression and the competing factional interests who are desperately trying to make sure the line falls the right way for them. Brenton is one of our most skilled writers, especially when it comes to bringing potentially dusty historical subjects to life, and so it proves once again here. The cast intelligently interrogate the honourable compassion at the heart of Radcliffe’s effort, expose the misguided good intentions and indeed the naked self-interest of so many of the interested parties. He also keeps a great sense of clarity to his writing, no history lessons needed here to understand just what is going on. Even through the distance imposed by the camera, the performance level of Howard Davies’ production remained deeply affecting. Tom Beard’s Radcliffe is an ideal central figure, gently baffled by the situation he finds himself in and taking the audience with him as he battles to see a way through to the future. Silas Carson’s sinuous Nehru s excellent, dignified in his pragmatism and movingly human as exposed by his affair with Mountbatten’s wife, a sensitive turn from Lucy Black. "
484,484,Ought To Be Clowns,09/06/2012,Ian,The Hairy Ape, Southwark Playhouse,"I loved Eugene O’Neill’s Anna Christie at the Donmar last year and thought his Long Day’s Journey Into Night was truly exceptional when I caught it earlier this year, so the prospect of one of his lesser known works – The Hairy Ape – at the ever-inventive Southwark Playhouse was one that intrigued and so I let myself be talked into catching it just before it closed. It is definitely closer to the former of the above-mentioned plays in its primal expressionism, tales of the sea and the search for belonging. In the engine room of a transatlantic liner, Yank is the king of his world, leading his team of workers as they shovel away. His certainties are stripped away when a young upper class lady makes her way below-deck, leaving shocked and horrified at what she sees but opening Yank’s eyes to life beyond what he knows. His reaction is to try to find out what disgusts her but he soon discovers that she represents a whole world that doesn’t or won’t accept him. O’Neill’s scene structure is quite choppy and so director Kate Budgen has adopted a physically compelling aesthetic with stylised movement and repeated actions working up and down Jean Chan’s transverse set which is bisected in the middle to create a cross. So the play frequently looks good and in Bill Ward’s powerfully drawn lead role, it pulses with a raw energy as Yank’s journey becomes increasingly fuelled by more desperate emotions. I have to admit to having frequent problems with understanding what he was saying though, O’Neill’s dialect was frequently close to impenetrable (especially when I couldn’t lip-read which was often, given the nature of the staging)."
485,485,Ought To Be Clowns,13/03/2013,Ian,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, Apollo,"One of the most successful plays of 2012 (and indeed my personal fourth-best play of the year) was the National Theatre’s adaptation of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time so it was little surprise to hear that it would transfer into the West End, albeit a little belatedly. So from the immersive in-the-round staging of the Cottesloe, it has now graduated to the much larger proscenium of the Apollo but where one might argue it has lost a little something of what made it so intimately special first time round, the transfer expands the physical and visual language of Marianne Elliott’s production to great effect to create something even more theatrical. Mark Haddon’s novel was inescapable as it rose to cult status and it is impressive that Simon Stephens’ adaptation manages to create something new, albeit entirely recognisable, out of the story. I still remain unconvinced by the touch of meta-business of the characters putting on a play of the story that is largely narrated by Niamh Cusack’s achingly kind Siobhan, but otherwise it is a sensitive and witty re-telling of the tale of Christopher Boone, a teenager who sees the world in an entirely different way to many of us and who is swept up in a personal odyssey spearheaded by his discovery of the body of his neighbour’s dog with a garden fork through him.  The distinctiveness of Christopher’s vision is captured with incredible invention in Bunny Christie’s design, a sensory experience like no other in trying to portray something of the synaptic jumps that his brain makes. And matching the visual ingenuity is Frantic Assembly’s choreography (Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett) which tries to make sense of the difficulties he faces in trying to establish physical relationships, the touch of other people being something he avoids at all cost. Both of these aspects have been exploded beautifully into the larger space of the West End theatre, with breath-taking moments aplenty. And leading the cast, with a performance that has already won a fosterIAN Best Actor award, is Luke Treadaway doing some simply extraordinary work. There’s never any hint of mockery or complacency in the detailed portrayal of a condition which is never specified (although commonly regarded to be Asperger’s) and he is magnetically, heartbreakingly, watchable with his teenage determination to solve the mysteries in his life. Nicola Walker and Paul Ritter have been replaced by Holly Aird and Seán Gleeson as his parents, struggling to always find the best way through with a son they can’t even hug and though I missed Walker’s raw desperation, Aird’s greater warmth was a nice new take on the character."
486,486,Ought To Be Clowns,31/05/2014,mag9l,Handbagged, Vaudeville,"Definitely something of a luxury revisit this one, my third time seeing it. But as Moira Buffini’s Handbagged has grown from a sketch as part of the Tricycle’s 2010 Women, Power and Politics season through to an Olivier-winning full length play which has now transferred into the West End, the chance to see its third incarnation was one I couldn’t resist. Not just seeing it on a larger stage, the one change to the cast from last year’s Tricycle production was what sold it to me.  Lucy Robinson may not be the most recognisable name out there but she played the first Lady Macbeth I ever saw on stage (at the Bolton Octagon) and she also starred in the most amazing schlocky late-night soap called Revelations back in the 90s which I was obsessed with at the time. She replaces Clare Holman as the younger version of the Queen (Liz) who locks horns regularly with Fenella Woolgar’s awesomely impressive Thatcher (Mags), in a hugely entertaining manner.  For they are not alone. Buffini also introduces their older counterparts – Marion Bailey’s Q and Stella Gonet’s T – and the four of them tell and retell history, and how their relationship (or lack thereof) impacted on key events of the time. Their interactions are full of humour and pathos – “’I’d like an interval now please’ ‘We don’t need an interval’” “’She froze me out for weeks over that salute’ ‘Nonsense’ ” – and the often quickfire banter is richly amusing yet balanced with precise care.  Playing with form as well as content means that politics often ends up playing second fiddle to comedy. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing – the two men in the show who take on all of the multifarious supporting roles are brilliantly played by the game Jeff Rawle and Neet Mohan – but it does mean that as Buffini lets us know where her sympathies lies very early on, the positioning of these two uber-powerful women lacks any real subtlety or real investigation. "
487,487,Ought To Be Clowns,19/02/2012,Ian,Option, Tricycle Theatre,"Amit Gupta’s Option was my favourite of the plays that made up the first part of the Tricycle’s The Bomb – a partial history, and probably the best of the entire collection. It centres on the debates and soul-searching of three Indian nuclear scientists in 1968: Professor Akram representing the past and a link to Gandhi’s founding principles, Dr Mishra a member of the government negotiating the extremely tricky waters around the intense pressure to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and Prakash an idealistic young man whose scientific passion promises much for the future. As China tests its own nuclear weapons and bitter enemy Pakistan increases its efforts to secure its own, India found itself torn between looking after the security of its own nation and succumbing to the international pressure to agree to the US/Soviet Union pact that would see them back down from arming. The geopolitics of the history of nuclear whatnot is normally most focused on the key players of the USA and USSR with little consideration for the realities on the ground in countries caught in their own mini-Cold Wars. I found this to be an utterly engrossing and fascinating piece of drama, the subject matter one that was new to me but rich in potential as it really threw up the dilemma faced by India, a country that had only recently gained its hard-earned independence but was instantly thrust into regional conflict. And it is this clash of idealism and pragmatism that just seemed so much more tragically moving here than I ever would have expected, mainly due to the even-handedness of Gupta’s characterisations, perhaps a little archetypal but so much more convincing in their arguments because of it."

489,489,Ought To Be Clowns,30/06/2013,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Stafford Castle,"The impressive ruins of Stafford Castle make a grand setting for the Stafford Festival Shakespeare, now in its 23rd year, and for this year’s production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, successfully transported to a Victorian England of colonial conquest, starched manners and a healthy dose of Gilbert and Sullivan. An open air stage, with covered seating on three sides, expands up the grassy slope to the castle itself and is used highly effectively, whether for a royal procession to make a strong impact or a torch-bearing fairy horde to swarm over the hillside, a constant reminder that so much of this story is about the strange happenings that will ensue if you end up in a mysterious forest on Midsummer eve.  Peter Rowe’s choice to set this in the Victorian era is an effective choice and one which works well across all the earthbound levels of the play. It makes a convincing case for the quarrelling quartet of lovers – Craig Fletcher (so very good in last year’s Boy Meets Boy) and Eamonn O’Dwyer all prim posturing and carefully rolled-up sleeves as Lysander and Demetrius, Jennifer Greenwood a spirited Hermia and a confident Georgina White coming close to stealing the show as an expressively comical Helena. And the Rude Mechanicals, led by Eric Potts’ bumptious Bottom, become a group of G&S-playing minstrels, the silliness of light opera suiting them perfectly as they build up to an extended musical version of Pyramus and Thisbe, which has to be one of the funnier treatments it has ever received.  Cross-casting the Fairy court and the Athenian court usually works well and so it does here, allowing the actors to play across a wider range. Simone James is an immaculate Hippolyta, her near-wordless presence in the opening scene demanding the attention from Theseus as he goes about his ducal business, and Robert Fitch is best as the jealous Oberon, his authoritarian edges tempered by his undeniable passion for Titania. And Lanre Malaolu’s charismatic Puck is an impish delight, cleverly doubled with the more muted but equally faithful Philostrate thus reinforcing his relationship with Theseus/Oberon. Not everything worked quite as successfully – the use of supernumeraries to beef up the number of fairies is well-judged, but an extended song and dance routine coming very late on (“we will sing and bless this place…” smacks of giving them something extra to do, when the focus should instead be on winding up the play, especially after the lengthy Rude Mechanicals skit. But slightly numbed buttocks aside, this made for a most appealing version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, a vibrant and fun-filled interpretation which serves as a strong reminder, not that they need it of course, that creative theatre can be found in the rudest of health right across the country."

491,491,Ought To Be Clowns,27/11/2011,Ian,The Kitchen Sink, Bush Theatre,"One of the things I love most about theatre is that it can be equally effective when being intimate and small-scale as when it is epic and showstoppingly huge. Tom Wells’ new play for the relocated Bush Theatre – The Kitchen Sink – falls into the first category and is all the more powerful for it. In fact, I would wager that it is probably one of the best pieces of new writing to appear on the London stage this year. Set in the Yorkshire seaside town of Withernsea, Wells’ play focuses on a family of four for whom life isn’t quite going exactly the right way. Dad Martin is a milkman but the milk float is falling to pieces and the demand just isn’t there like it used to be; Billy is an art student hoping to get a place at a London art college but simultaneously terrified at the prospect, and his sister Sophie is training to be a jiu-jitsu teacher but is having issues with her teacher. In the middle of them all is mum Kath, a dinner lady with an irrepressible perkiness that is determined to keep her husband and kids going through their respective crises, but there’s something wrong with her sink that threatens to test even her patience. As demonstrated in his recent play Me, As A Penguin which was another small-scale wonder at the Arcola, Wells is a highly gifted writer who is able to rattle off one-liners at an alarming rate yet keeping them fresh and as funny as you will hear – this play contains one of the best jokes about the London Underground ever. But he is also able to find the beauty and poignancy in what might be considered the mundane, the play is full of little day-to-day moments that collect into a whole of great emotional heft. This is assisted by some absolutely spot-on casting: Lisa Palfrey makes something close to the perfect mother as the warm Kath, game for almost anything whether it be couscous or cannabis and with Steffan Rhodri’s beautifully pitched worn-down Martin, make a thoroughly believable couple. Leah Brotherhead’s Sophie is quietly devastating as a young woman who hasn’t quite yet flourished, though the attentions of Andy Rush’s adorable plumber slowly awaken the potential in her as she deals with her issues. But Ryan Sampson as Billy edged it as my favourite performance, contrasting a natural-feeling campness with the heavy weight of an awkward self-consciousness that belies his years, and coming off as a fantastic comic actor – his is the Circle Line joke and his facial expressions, especially at a climactic moment, are just perfect. The Kitchen Sink is a warm hug of a play: one that recognises that life is sometimes shit, but also that if we are willing to change, even if just a little bit, things can always get better. The new Bush Theatre have gotten off to a flying start here and they have the most exciting hand-dryers I have ever experienced, I thought nothing could replace the Dyson airblade but it’s like a pincushion of air! They just need to work on serving people at the bar a tiny bit quicker…"
492,492,Ought To Be Clowns,09/05/2005,Ian,The House of Bernarda Alba, National Theatre,"Set in 1930s Spain in a stunningly mounted (by Vicki Mortimer) palace of an Andalusian house, the Alba household is mourning the death of matriarch Bernarda’s husband but the actual feeling is one more akin to liberation as it turns out she relishes the chance to take control of the family, of her five unmarried daughters, and maintain the staunchly Catholic ethos of sexual repression despite the natural urges of her girls. For there’s a man, there’s always a man, who becomes engaged to the eldest (and ostensibly the ugliest) as she inherits much of her father’s wealth. But jealous of her potential escape from the household through marriage, two other sisters also fall for the same gentleman, one of them even allowing him to deflower her and the explosive consequences result in tragic ends. As the five daughters, Sandy McDade, Justine Mitchell, Katherine Manners, Jo McInnes and Sally Hawkins were all excellent, evoking a lifetime of simmering resentments and sibling rivalries with their acting and particularly with their heavily weighted silences and as the girls with perhaps the most to lose, McDade as the eldest and Hawkins as the youngest really were exceptional. But it is Penelope Wilton as the vicious, stick-wielding Bernarda, as much a damaged product of the society as anyone else, but a darkly dominant force, determined to protect the family’s reputation even if it means tearing the family apart from inside by closing her eyes and ears to the power of emotions like love, lust and jealousy. Deborah Findlay as her servant/confidante matches Wilton well, trying in vain to warn her, but ultimately serving her mistress."
493,493,Ought To Be Clowns,02/10/2014,Ian,Breeders, St James,"Heading up the One Stage season of work led by emerging producers – in this case Vicky Graham – Ben Ockrent’s Breeders sees a sadly rare thing, a play that just casually has more women than men in its cast. When you hear that it is a comedy about lesbians who want to become parents then that becomes a little less surprising but from the anecdotal evidence I’ve been collecting this year, our stages remain disproportionately weighted with testosterone. Anyhoo, back to the lesbians. Andrea and Caroline have just moved into a swanky new house and want to fill it with a family and specifically, with a family that is as biologically connected to them as possible. So they ask Andrea’s brother Jimmy to be the sperm donor, something that takes him and his girlfriend Sharon by surprise, and as they agree to create their own version of a modern family, it appears that they’re breeding as much trouble as they are children. First up, Ockrent’s play really is quite funny indeed. The set-up may be quite sitcom-ish and James Perkins’ one-room design plays into this a little, but there are some cracking gags in here – the bag of flour garnering the biggest laughs but a real spiky honesty to much of the dialogue means that the laughs really do keep on coming. And the surreal twist of the interludes – why, they’re Swedish covers of pop songs of course – lends its own comic edge. The only problem comes with the writer’s uncertainty of tone when it comes to the more serious side of things. Issues like gay parenthood, the environmental impact of having a child, even just the rights that a sperm donor has to the end product of their endeavour are all raised and dealt with in a flash with nervous laughter, their dramatic potential sacrificed for easy humour and begging the question why they have been included in the first place, if not to be explored properly."
494,494,Ought To Be Clowns,15/07/2017,Ian,Blondel, Union,"There’s something admirable in the Union Theatre’s admirable determination to work its way through the dustier, neglected end of the musical theatre canon to see if anything comes up roses. I liked what they did with Anyone Can Whistle, less so with Moby Dick, and now its the turn of the lesser-known Tim Rice musical Blondel (the first he wrote after his Andrew Lloyd Webber collaborations) to get the revival treatment. Sometimes though, when polishing a pebble in the hope that it turns into a diamond in the rough, it remains a pebble. Sasha Regan’s high-spirited, fun-loving production has a wonderfully playful energy about it, and the cast are clearly having a whale of a time, but it isn’t too hard to see why the show has rather languished in obscurity. Daftness can only take you so far (believe me, I know!) and Blondel (over-)runs at 2 hours 30 minutes. Set at the time of the Third Crusade (1189, keep up) where the titular troubadour finds himself on an unlikely rescue mission across Europe for his beloved king Richard the Lionheart, Blondel’s plan is to sing his biggest song outside every castle in Europe so that Dicky can sing back to him and thus reveal where he is. Like I said, it is silly and mostly fun – there’s just way too many songs stuffed into the score which drags things out unnecessarily."
495,495,Ought To Be Clowns,22/02/2012,Ian,In Basildon, Royal Court,"One of David Eldridge’s most recent previous plays – The Knot of the Heart for the Almeida – proved to be one of the most divisive I’ve experienced in terms of the response from the critics who lauded it and so many of the bloggers and audience members of my acquaintance who really did not like it at all. So when the new season at the Royal Court was announced featuring a new play by him, I was OK with not booking it as it helped me with my ‘I will cut down on the amount of theatre I see’ mantra. But then they announced the cast and as soon as I saw the names Linda Bassett and Ruth Sheen I knew that I would have to book for In Basildon. Bassett blew me away in the Arcola’s undersung The Road To Mecca and Sheen is an actress whose work I have recently revisited and adored in recent Mike Leigh films, and the Leigh connection is furthered with the presence of other regular collaborators Peter Wight and Wendy Nottingham. So I was a mixture of reluctance and eager anticipation as I schlepped off to Sloane Square to catch the final preview. Dying from prostate cancer, salt-of-the-earth Len has returned to the home he inherited from his parents as friends and family gather round his sickbed. Sister Doreen and best friend Ken lead the group but the atmosphere is shaken by the return of estranged sister Maureen who hasn’t spoken to ‘Dor’ in nearly 20 years. As Len passes away, attention turns to his will as everyone seems to have a claim on something, including Pam from next door, Doreen’s son Barry and his wife, and Shelley, Maureen’s daughter and Eldridge explores the tensions that emerge from these family loyalties and how they change over time and across the generations. The complexities of sibling relationships are brutally exposed but also overlaid with a frank discussion about class and how it is intrinsically connected to location, their working-class politics shaped by hard-earned experience. Confrontational, conflicted and compelling, Eldridge’s writing speaks with the darkest of humour but also the ring of a deep emotional truth. It’s just a shame that the Royal Court have decided to play the ‘tricksy’ card with the staging. Ian MacNeil’s design is an odd one, placing the living room in the centre of the Royal Court downstairs leaving the audience straddling the stage and thus Dominic Cooke’s direction has to constantly bear the traverse in mind. It adds nothing to the performance – the stage is still elevated so it is not as if we’re in the living room with them – and has a strange impact on key scenes. The play opens with Len on his deathbed, but the combination of the bedhead and his head being slightly raised means that only the people on the backstage side (like us) can see him (though he doesn’t do much, aside from splutter a little as he leaves this mortal coil); and then later on at the reading of the will, Ken plonks his chair down facing the usual theatre side and delivers the news exclusively to that side of the theatre. My heart sank when this happened – as a lip reader it made things much more difficult for me as there’s only so much Peter Wight can say with his back – but the plus side is that we got to see the faces of every other character as they responded to the news and this actually came close to making up for it: the eager anticipation of all, the glares between the sisters and the scorn directed by both at Ken, the look of triumph on Tom’s face as Pam gets her share – it just seems a shame that it has to be an either/or thing. For quibbles about the staging aside, the acting is simply sensational from all angles. Sheen and Bassett crackle against each other, their enmity horribly palpable as they spit venom at each other; Lee Ross as the gorgeously appealing Barry is such a comforting presence on the stage even as he rails against a world that hasn’t quite worked out for him, especially with a strident Debbie Chazen as his wife, bolshily determined to push his mother out of the picture once they finally get pregnant; Jade Williams convinces as graduate teacher Shelley who is keen to forget her roots and I loved Max Bennett’s Tom, a middle-class sore thumb in this household whose drink-fuelled liberal guilt is hilariously played yet cleverly makes its point about the assumptions that are often made about the working classes and notions of popular culture, especially in Wendy Nottingham’s exquisitely detailed Pam."
496,496,Ought To Be Clowns,04/03/2005,Ian,Chicago, Cambridge Theatre,
497,497,Ought To Be Clowns,01/05/2018,Ian,Not Talking, Arcola,"A treat here in the premiere of Mike Bartlett’s first-ever play, never seen before in a theatre. But something of a qualified treat, because 2005’s Not Talking was written as a radio play and as sumptuously cast as James Hiller’s production for the Arcola and Defibrillator is (with Kika Markham and David Horovitch), it’s a drama that never really escapes these origins. The play is constructed as two pairs of two intertwining but distinct monologues – separated by time on the one side, kept apart by emotional distance on the other. Reflecting back on their lives, James and Lucy have the benefit, such as it is, of experience; at the beginning of their potential story, Mark and Amanda find their lives no less blighted by momentous events.    It’s an intellectually clever conceit and one which Hillier stages with as much ingenuity as he can muster. Amy Cook’s design and Zoe Spurr’s lighting go a long way to creating a sparse, liminal space in which these remembrances are disgorged, painful events recalled, relationships tested to their extreme. And keeping the characters moving allows hints to emerge at their interconnectedness. I caught a late preview so suitable caveats apply, but the play’s structure does end up working against it as a piece of dramatic theatre. Thematic threads are drawn between past and present, particularly a complex attitude to the military from conscientious objectors to Deepcut, and the strains of Chopin on the piano. But something a little static does weigh down the later stages and ultimately, you could question what the play gains from being mounted IRL. That said, Markham and Horovitch are predictably excellent as the older couple, estrangement creeping in even after decades together. And Gemma Lawrence and Lawrence Walker impress as a pair of young squaddies coming to terms with an environment which inhibits free communication with devastating effect. Worth a watch if you’re a fan of Bartlett’s work. "
498,498,Ought To Be Clowns,19/11/2012,Ian,Thérèse Raquin, Finborough,"Catching my eye this year though was the chance to see a musical version of Thérèse Raquin with music by Craig Adams and book and lyrics by Nona Shepphard. We were treated to the first half in its entirety and remarkably, a cast of 13 gathered to give full voice to this intriguingly pitched musical which lies, in the astute words of my companion for the evening, ‘between Les Mis and Sunday in the Park with George”. I’ll keep things brief as this is a work-in-progress but the efforts of the leads can’t go unnoticed as there was some incredible work going on on the stage given how little time they must have had to prepare. Katie Brayben channeled her inner Julie Walters brilliantly playing way above her age as a bustling, slightly comic Madame Raquin who dotes on her sickly son Camille, a well-observed earnestness coming from Bart Edwards. The connection between this pair is well-constructed both musically and in the book, amusing light-heartedness balanced with a slightly oppressive insularity that Camille’s wife Thérèse just cannot deal with."
499,499,Ought To Be Clowns,09/10/2014,Ian,Sweeney Todd, Twickenham Theatre,"Issues of local provision aside, does London really need any more new theatres, elbowing their way onto an already cluttered fringe? The Twickenham Theatre certainly makes a case for it with this inventive take on Sondheim’s classic Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and with a cracking cast to boot, but the test will be later on when shows that don’t have Olivier winners and musical theatre titans open here and the real job of attracting a regular audience begins. For the meantime, they can bask in the sold-out signs rightly travelling for the delights of an unmiked production –Benjamin Holder’s band a constant pleasure in its musical skill – and a hugely resourceful interpretation – helmed brilliantly by Derek Anderson – that makes a virtue of the intimacy of this space above a pub and find ever more inventive ways to use it through the cleverness of Rachel Stone’s set and Simon Gethin Thomas’ smoky lighting design. The Olivier winner is David Bedella who takes on the leading role and whilst darkly swaggering, he doesn’t quite nail the psychological acuity needed to really explicate the bitter complexity at Todd’s heart. Sarah Ingram fares better as Mrs Lovett though, a balance of hilarity and hopelessness that is all the more affecting for being so close up, the direct eye contact here is genuinely disturbing as she simultaneously amuses and appals and asks us with alacrity to acquiesce in her actions."
500,500,Ought To Be Clowns,03/07/2016,mag9l,She Loves Me, Studio 54 via BroadwayHD,"It’s nice to know that you have good karma, sometimes at least, as I came very close to seeing She Loves Me on my last flying visit to Broadway, opting for Waitress instead at the last minute. So it was most gratifying to hear that She Loves Me was to become the first ever Broadway show to be live-streamed on BroadwayHD, following in the footsteps of the hugely successful NTLive enterprise (and that the show would be available for the following seven days on catch-up, making up for the time difference). The merits (or otherwise) of live-streaming have long been debated and will likely continue to be so for years to come as circular arguments go round and round. But as long as you accept that no, a recording will never be as good as the live thing and yes, it is an amazing thing to have accessibility increased in this way, it seems to me that everyone is a winner, especially with a show on a limited engagement like She Loves Me, which closes at Studio 54 on 10th July. Speaking of which, you’ve only got until 7th July to catch it on BroadwayHD. For the show itself, part of Roundabout’s 50th anniversary season, it is a near-perfect music-box of a production. Based on Miklós László’s play Parfumerie which has been remade more than once as films The Shop Around The Corner, In The Good Old Summertime, and You’ve Got Mail, Joe Masterhoff’s book pits warring Budapest shop employees Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash against each other, little knowing that they are corresponding anonymously through a lonely hearts column – will they get together in the end? What do you think?! Much of the joy of She Loves Me comes in Jerry Bock’s effervescent score (lyrics by Sheldon Harnick) which fizzes and pops in all the right places, evoking a classic age of musical theatre and one which is perfectly delivered by the rainbow-brightness of Laura Benanti’s pure soprano (such a rarity to hear a legit soprano role) and the gentlemanly charm of Zachary Levi, whose rendition of the title song is just joyous. They bicker with brio and disagree with real dynamism and make an ideal match who truly light up the stage (and screen!). But Scott Ellis’ production is no one-couple-show, it is also blessed with a superlative supporting turn from Jane Krakowski as fellow shopworker Ilona, smitten by the dastardly Kodaly (a dapper Gavin Creel doing well to mask his general loveliness) and who demonstrates that she’s more flexible in her 40s than many of us will ever be in our entire lifetime. Peter Bartlett’s Head Waiter gets an eye-catching dance turn pre-interval, Nicholas Barasch’s appealing delivery boy Arpad shines immediately post-interval – it really is a wonderfully democratic show. David Rockwell’s picture-book of a set looks like a dream, Warren Carlyle’s choreography sparkles like snowflakes, and Paul Gemignani’s musical direction keeps the whole thing sound peachy, it really is a superb production. And credit to David Horn who directed the live-stream, for capturing so much of what makes the show work. I welcome the arrival of Broadway on the live-streaming stage and look forward to hearing what else we might be able to see soon without having to cross the ocean. "
501,501,Ought To Be Clowns,21/09/2014,Ian,Happy Birthday Sunita, Watford Palace,"For as with any family, the Johals have their secrets and dramas and lifelong resentments and as the drinks starts to flow, truths start to spill out over the plates of curries and rotis. There’s a real sense of the family bond here though, no matter how strained it gets – in the blink of an eye, brother and sister go from bickering to bhangra dancing, the mother who makes sure all the cooking is done before unleashing her own shocking revelation.  Virdi is particularly keen on exploring the impact of bi-culturalism on their lives – Tejpal and her husband arrived here 40 years ago but the pull of home remains strong, he’s back in India building the family a new house and whilst she has a spanking new kitchen, her old spice-infused one has been reassembled in the garage. And even for the younger generation who are more superficially Westernised, their behaviour patterns speak of age-old tradition that they don’t want disturbed. "
502,502,Ought To Be Clowns,08/09/2011,Ian,Rock of Ages, Shaftesbury,"If you thought that it would be rather unlikely for me to be going to Rock of Ages, then you would have been correct. It didn’t have the instant appeal to me, not so much in the fact that it is a jukebox musical but rather that the music on which it is based is the kind of the classic 1980s rock of which I wasn’t a fan as a boy at the time nor have I become one now. But one of the joys of maintaining a blog such as this is that occasionally I am offered tickets to shows, thereby getting to see things I wouldn’t normally have considered and so broadening my theatrical horizons, so thank you very much AKA, I am most grateful. So that is how I ended up in the Shaftesbury Theatre on a Wednesday evening, being served beer at my seat, fake lighter in hand. The show has been something of a success on Broadway and has been eagerly anticipated by fans of the show here, of whom I know a surprising number, but I knew nothing of the show itself. It centres on Hollywood rock dive The Bourbon Room which is threatened with closure by some German developers who want to ‘clean up’ the city and the effect that will have on the people who work and frequent the bar. The owner calls in a big rock star to play his final gig there before splitting with his band; a city planner wants to secure its unique place in the town’s history, and these all have an impact on the tentative and tortured love story between the barman (and would-be rocker) and the waitress (an aspiring actress). But Chris D’Arienzo’s book isn’t satisfied with just telling a story, it also passes comment on musical theatre as a genre with plenty of fourth wall breaking, mainly by the narrator, the audience being constantly acknowledged with many a raised eyebrow or cheeky wink. And this is where the show lost me as I didn’t feel it managed to marry these two elements particularly well: on the one hand, there’s a deal of poking of fun at the conventions of musical theatre, but on the other there is a conventional musical theatre story being told at the same time, and these seem to work against each other. The best moment of the show for me was the delightfully silly male duet of ‘Can’t Fight This Feeling’ complete with overblown dance moves and just highly amusing, but it is sandwiched between a traditional musical number, to a rock song natch, with some deadly serious choreo and a po-faced and sadly rather flat rendition of ‘Every Rose Has Its Thorn’ which needs much more drama injected into it. For me the mixture doesn’t gel: the satirical side needs to be threaded through all scenes of the show, or else the main story needs to be further fleshed out to create more believable and likeable characters and a plot one can invest in. Taking the serious hat off, there is a huge amount of energy onstage and a clear enthusiasm for the show from a committed ensemble. Oliver Tompsett as the leading wannabe rocker Drew sounds sensational as does Amy Pemberton as love interest Sherrie, even if she has to negotiate some very random character decisions and hopefully time will bring a little more sexual chemistry between the pair. Justin Lee Collins and Shayne Ward, the two faces from the promotional material, are also both surprisingly excellent in what are supporting roles but both strong-voiced and Ward in particular demonstrating some nifty comic timing. Star of the show for me though is Simon Lipkin as Lonny the narrator who also works in the bar. It is he who does most of the fourth wall breaking and he does it perfectly, whipping up such a great natural rapport with the audience from the off. The ensemble, featuring a Strallen of course which is de rigeur for a musical these days! (Zizi in this case), are excellent though I personally think Twinnie Lee Moore is far too good not be in bigger roles. And being picky, I’d say that Rohan Tickell could afford to be a little more Teutonic, Rachel McFarlane though sounding great, needs to capture more of her strip club manager Justice’s character and likewise Jodie Jacobs didn’t quite hit the acting and comic notes quite right for me though also sounding good. Truth be told, I was never the target audience for this show and I was bemused by finding that I had never heard of more than half the songs – apparently fans of Guitar Hero will be fine, though that is an activity in which I have yet to partake. But more than that, I couldn’t help but feel disappointed at what I found to be weak material. My heart died a little every time people laughed raucously at the campery of Sandy Moffat’s Franz, he does well but something about the audience reaction really stuck in my throat and in any case, the gay/European thing has been done much more effectively, sensitively and funnily in another show still in the West End – here it just feels lazy and at worse, panders to both latent xenophobia and homophobia."
503,503,Ought To Be Clowns,10/08/2017,Ian,Gavin Creel – Quiet (2010) / Oliver Tompsett – Gravity (2013),,"2010 EP Quiet by Tony winner Gavin Creel is really rather lovely indeed. Six tracks of acoustically-inclined folk pop co-written with Robbie Roth, it is a short but sweet album of real heart that emphasises the musicality of this musical theatre star, and also shows a wise progression from his first album. And if we’re to believe the lyrics here, that heart is a substantially bruised one which works out very well for fans of a melancholy ballad. Such fans are particularly well served by the opening pair of tracks. The delicate ‘Green To Grey’ and the plaintive reality check of ‘Love Fell Down’ are desperately heartfelt and beautifully moving as Creel allows a husky tenderness to colour his voice to gorgeous effect. The collection is intelligently sequenced too, allowing a note of hope to creep in with the late realisation of ‘Small Words’ and the gentle humour of closer ‘Hot Ohio’.  Stripped back to guitar and occasional lines of harmony that drift in beautifully, this is music to smooth and sooth the soul, and a refreshing new side (to me at least) to this most talented of performers. Crossing the ocean and part of an online project that saw him releasing music with his brother Ben, Gravity is a 4 track EP from West End leading man Oliver Tompsett.  It’s a solid collection of inspirational pop songs, its highlight for me being the Celtic-tinged charms of Precious Little Moments with Amy Cassidy and Ben Tompsett. The soaring build of the title track has a compelling strength to it and as with ‘Rescue Me One More Time’, the gentle piano intro allows a real sense of the depth of passion in Tompsett’s voice to shine through. "
504,504,Ought To Be Clowns,20/07/2016,mag9l,The Stripper, St James,"If only, for Richard O’Brien and Richard Hartley’s The Stripper is a fantastically misjudged piece of theatre, an attempt at noir-ish convention dressed up in musical theatre clothing from 1982. This pair of Dicks give us a real dick, from Carter Brown’s pulp fiction story, in Al Wheeler, a detective trying to get to the bottom of the suicide of hot actress Patty Keller but do precisely nothing to address his dickishness. You could try and argue period detail with its 60s-set sexism but failing to interrogate it in this day and age is pretty much unforgivable. Which is a shame as there’s the makings of something interesting here. Hartley and O’Brien’s score is an enjoyable mixture of period-appropriate musical influences that is toe-tappingly tuneful and catchy in places too. And director Benji Sperring has gathered a great cast of 5 who energetically cover a multitude of roles – Sebastien Torki and Gloria Onitiri both stand out. But where Sperring was able to tap into something with his most recent pulp project The Toxic Avenger, albeit still with a couple of tonal mis-steps, it’s much harder to reconcile what happens here."
505,505,Ought To Be Clowns,28/10/2017,Ian,Insignificance, Arcola,"I loved chemistry at school, enjoyed biology too but for some reason, my brain could never wrap itself around physics. So when two characters in Terry Johnson’s play Insignificance started discussing the specific nature of the theory of relativity – albeit through the medium of toy trains and helium-filled balloons – I was thrown back to the mild panic of Mr Byrchall’s classroom and the general feel of ‘I just don’t get it!’. But Insignificance is not a play about physics and the two characters aren’t just any random people. It’s 1954 and though they’re officially named The Actress and The Professor, we can – with reasonable confidence – infer that they’re Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein. And they’re intermittently joined by her husband Joe DiMaggio – The Ball Player – and Joseph McCarthy – The Senator, for a fantasia on the nature of celebrity that is occasionally quite dazzling. Johnson’s trick is to never veer too far into the realms of the improbably fictitious, locating instead a what-if territory that fleshes out these famous faces far beyond the personae for which they’re known. So Alice Bailey Johnson’s excellent Monroe reveals herself to be far cleverer that she is ever given credit for, and Simon Rouse’s intriguing Einstein has libido to go with his brains as their meeting in his hotel room edges ever closer to the central bed of Max Dorey’s design."
506,506,Ought To Be Clowns,05/02/2010,Ian,Waiting for Godot, Theatre Royal Haymarket,"There’s clearly a business case for bringing this production back as it was so successful and keeping as stellar a name as Ian McKellen to get the bums on seats again, but surely the main draw was seeing the combination of McKellen and Stewart and I do find the recasting decisions a little curious, part of me thinks they should have gone the whole hog in order to create an entirely new production. That is not to negate the efforts of all involved, Rees’ Vladimir felt more comfortable to watch for me, being an all-round more genial soul and he has developed a great relationship with McKellen’s Estragon which gives a lighter feel to the whole shebang. Matthew Kelly’s Pozzo is a more authoritative, intimidating presence, quite different from Simon Callow’s, with Ronald Pickup continuing the same solid work as before on the end of the rope."
507,507,Ought To Be Clowns,22/06/2014,mag9l,Quietly, Soho Theatre,"Something of a shame as this was the final performance of Owen McCafferty’s Quietly at the Soho Theatre and it turned out to be quite the doozy. A £5 ticket deal sweetened the deal and in a neat twist, a game of international football started just as one in the play did (although it was Belgium vs Russia, as opposed to the Northern Ireland v Poland game of the script). In that Belfast bar, Jimmy is shooting the breeze with Polish barman Robert – the playwright capturing excellently a natural flow of dialogue which continues throughout the whole play – ruminating over what trouble there’ll be on the street if the result doesn’t go the right way. But Jimmy has bigger things on his mind as is clear when another man, Ian, enters and he headbutts him to the ground. Thus the scene is set for the slow unfolding of the tangled history between the pair, on opposite sides of the religious divide but yet connected in the deepest of ways and McCafferty brilliantly uncoils his plot with a great subtlety. The ‘quietly’ of the title should not be underestimated as after that initial outburst of violence, the physical aspect is then quietened as an eerie stillness descends on the pub as a process of truth and reconciliation is attempted to acknowledge the devastating events of the past."
508,508,Ought To Be Clowns,19/12/2018,Ian,The Convert, Young Vic,"There’s all sorts of lovely connections here. Danai Gurira’s play The Convert was first seen in the UK at the Gate last year, a theatre where her earlier drama Eclipsed was produced in 2015. That play starred Letitia Wright in an astonishing performance and Wright now appears in this new version of The Convert at the Young Vic – Wright and Gurira having starred in some little arthouse film called Black Panther in the meantime… It’s a cracking good play too, worth the attention of this second production. Set in 1896 Rhodesia (modern day Zimbabwe), it looks at the ways in which colonial rulers sought to erase African cultural identities through any means they saw fit. Culturally, religiously, linguistically, their tools of ‘progress’ were wielded with considerable force and Gurira counts up the cost with a slow-building dramatic flair. Taken at age 9, Ndovlu is a success for them. Now known as Chilford, this devout Catholic priest has taken the duties of converting others most seriously and in the shape of his housekeeper’s niece Jekesai, he has the ideal new recruit. But as the newly christened Ester throws herself entirely into her new life, the conflict between natives and interlopers (of any types) becomes more and more acute."
509,509,Ought To Be Clowns,16/10/2013,Ian,Bare, Greenwich Theatre,"Not really being a fan of rock musicals, I didn’t make the journey to the Union Theatre to see Bare earlier this year and I was kind of reluctant to go and see its belated transfer to the Greenwich Theatre. And true to form, it really wasn’t my cup of tea. A cast of bright young things sing well and deliver a great level of performance but the show, written by Jon Hartmere and Damon Intrabartolo, feels dated both dramatically and musically, its off-Broadway high-school charms very much eluding me. Set in the senior class of a Catholic high school, these 17 year olds race towards graduation whilst battling with issues of sexuality and identity, religion and reality, all the while rehearsing a production of Romeo and Juliet which ham-fistedly reflects the tortured inter-relations between this tangled group. Clunky comedy turns into deficient drama as boy meets closeted boy meets girl, but the nearly entirely sung-through lyrics rarely give such an emotive issue as homosexuality in high schools the sensitivity and complexity it deserves."
510,510,Ought To Be Clowns,16/08/2015,mag9l,The Iliad Online, Almeida/Live-stream,"After three weeks away, all my initial thoughts were on a cosy night in catching up on the first two episodes of The Great British Bake-off and I couldn’t imagine anything changing my mind – how wrong could I be! When the Almeida first announced their durational performance of Homer’s Iliad, it sounded like a madcap plan, a morning ‘til night affair in association with the British Museum and featuring over 60 actors – the only thing stopping me from booking was it being the last day of my holiday! But fortunately, the good folk of the Almeida decided to livestream the whole shebang – all 16 hours and 18,255 lines of it – so that people could dip in and out to their heart’s content as well as attending at the British Museum for free during the daytime. I switched on at about 8pm as Bertie Carvel started his section, intending just to sample its wares but sure enough, I was there until the bitter end around 1am, having been sucked into its unique brilliance and unable to miss a minute more of it. Directed by Rupert Goold and Robert Icke, it has to rank as one of the theatrical highlights of the year, even though I missed hours thereof and was just watching on my laptop. As the baton passed from actor to actor, reciting their way through one of the keystones not just of Greek but of modern drama, it was a mesmerising experience to revel in the different performance styles and the wonderfully hypnotic storytelling courtesy of Robert Fagles’ translation."
511,511,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2016,mag9l,The Girls, Lowry,"“Look in the eye of your dear fucker uppers” There cannot be many of you out there who do not know the real-life story of the Calendar Girls. It made national news at the time; the film has been around for more than a decade; and the stage play followed not long behind. Now, author Tim Firth has joined forces with Gary Barlow of Take That (a popular beat combo, m’lud) in a musical version, which mysteriously has shed the ‘Calendar’ and is just called The Girls. For those recently returned from Mars, the story is set in a small Yorkshire town where Annie loses her husband, John, to cancer. Her best friend, Chris, and other Women’s Institute friends rally round to find a way to pay tribute to the man they all loved and decide on a nude calendar. The profits will buy a new settee for the Relatives Room at the hospital where John was treated. Could this story stand yet another retelling? Well, my answer is a resounding if slightly surprised yes. Firth and Barlow have created a richly entertaining evening, at times gentle, sad and moving whilst being overwhelmingly joyous and funny. However, anyone who expects to hear a series of blockbuster Gary Barlow pop songs will be disappointed. The music is good and features some lovely melodies but its main achievement is how skillfully it works with the script to add a new dimension to the story, taking the narrative forward whilst encapsulating the humour and sadness and allowing the characters to express their innermost thoughts and feelings. In this sense, it is more of a play with songs than a true musical.  As to the performers, Joanna Riding and Claire Moore are outstanding in the lead roles of Annie and Chris, yet the real strength of the cast is its collective excellence. The other members of the WI do a superb job of portraying ordinary women doing something extraordinary as the prospect of appearing nude forces them to assess their own relationships and inner uncertainties. The calendar shoot scene was brilliantly played by all the women; it was elegant, tasteful and, above all, hilariously funny. The men, although secondary to the main theme, all have their moment in the spotlight and the three teenagers (a lively trio of relative newcomers in Chloe May Jackson, Ben Hunter and Josh Benson) get some of the funniest scenes – the song where they reflect on the damage inflicted on them by their parents (“Look in the eye of your dear fucker uppers”) brought the house down. The direction is sharp and pacey and the audience’s emotions are kept constantly on the move as humour follows sadness follows humour. In one of the hospital scenes, you’ve just had time to shed a tear as Annie starts to come to terms with her imminent loss when Chris arrives in a stolen wheelchair boasting: “You’ve no idea how quickly I just got served in this”. The set design is striking, with drawers, cupboards and cabinets painted green and stacked on top of each other so that they can be climbed to create the Yorkshire Dales (such as when John finally succumbs to cancer) or opened to provide entrances and exits. This includes two scenes featuring my choice for the little-known Prop of the Year award, an authentic 1960s Morris Minor van. I suppose that, if I really tried, I could find some things to criticise – but I think it would just be curmudgeonly. The Girls has played to packed houses and nightly standing ovations for its entire run at the Lowry. North West audiences clearly know an uplifting, feel-good story told with wit and humour when they see it, and who am I to argue?"
512,512,Ought To Be Clowns,13/07/2018,Ian,The Lehman Trilogy, National Theatre,"At a time when Lady Liberty’s message was actually heeded, when the USA lifted the lamp to its golden door and welcomed all that immigrants could bring, three German Jewish brothers made the journey from Bavaria in the 1840s and set up shop in Montgomery, Alabama. From selling cotton cloth to brokering cotton sales to diversifying into other markets, other cities, they built up their family business into a financial services behemoth, the very embodiment of the American Dream. The name of that firm – Lehman Brothers… Thus The Lehman Trilogy is a tale of boom to bust. Stefano Massini’s epic play, adapted here by Ben Power in a National Theatre and Neal Street Productions co-production, takes a generational viewpoint to move us through 170 years of American history and three generations of Lehman men. And in the hands of Simon Russell Beale (Henry), Ben Miles (Emanuel) and Adam Godley (Mayer), they could scarcely be better in Sam Mendes’ sleekly poised and pacey production. Not only do they play the brothers, their son and their grandsons, they cover all the other roles as they narrate their own story – it truly is an acting tour-de-force.  And its a fascinating slice of history too, the growth of an utterly capitalist mindset viewed through a uniquely personal lens. The depth of sacrifice necessary to be ‘successful’ never more obvious than in the whittling away of their Jewish traditions and cultural identities; never more painfully fruitless than in the face of the global financial crisis that we know is to come. This personal focus does ultimately give a sense that Massini is a little in awe of the brothers, seduced by the self-made success storyline whilst never truly indicting them for the results of their ruthlessness.   It is hard to complain though when three actors of this calibre are being license to play just so damn entertainingly. Russell Beale naturally steals the limelight with his female characters and the surprisingly accuracy of his piano ‘playing’ ( I swear his Bach Prelude was note-perfect even without a keyboard). Es Devlin’s swirling cube is a design masterpiece with its glass walls denoting barely-there partitions, and Luke Halls’ panoramic video work is stunning. It may be overwhelmingly male and pale (a stubbornly enduring problem it would seem) but it is so far from stale – a thrilling production."
513,513,Ought To Be Clowns,28/03/2018,Ian,The Inheritance Part One, Young Vic,"I’m just going to write the one review to cover both parts of the The Inheritance but I wanted to flag up that if, for some crazy reason, the full seven hours of Mathew Lopez’s epic didn’t appeal, then you could do worse than sticking with Part One. For though it may not have any Vanessa Redgrave, it does contain a moment of pure transcendent beauty that left me weeping on the bus journey home, and so how could you possibly now resist?! "
514,514,Ought To Be Clowns,20/02/2012,Ian,The Letter of Last Resort,,"“Onboard a submarine, there’s a safe. Inside that safe there’s another safe. And inside that one is a letter.” Probably my favourite section in the second part of the Tricycle’s The Bomb – a partial history was David Greig’s The Letter of Last Resort. Simon Chandler’s civil servant is pressuring Belinda Lang’s newly installed Prime Minister to put contingency arrangements in place in case of a (nuclear) catastrophe yet as she decides what course of action is to be taken in response to whatever attack has taken place, she is pulled down into a swirl of contradictory absurdist logic. Greig’s writing is sharply observed and extremely funny – especially in the revelation of just how the submarine commander will ascertain if Britain has been destroyed – but it also has real heart as this PM comes to terms with the gravity of the decision she has to make. Lang plays this excellently, her determination to not let her position rob her of her humanity slowly worn down by the devil’s advocate of Simon Chandler’s adviser who is always able to offer the bigger picture about what must be done as opposed to what is right."
515,515,Ought To Be Clowns,25/02/2012,Ian,All My Sons, Digital Theatre,"There’s not really much more to be said about All My Sons that I didn’t cover in my original review of the play. Howard Davies’ production of Arthur Miller’s classic was a deserved huge success in the West End in 2010 and Digital Theatre captured it on film over two nights in September and so one now has the opportunity to rent it online, or download it to watch via their video player. The fact that the play takes place on the single set lends itself to being captured quite easily on film, there’s little theatrical shenanigans employed here to distract from the fireworks of the acting, that is the real focus of this show. David Suchet’s oily geniality and Zoë Wanamaker’s blind forthrightedness are simply exceptional together as the Kellers play host to family and neighbours and are ultimately left helpless as long-buried truths from the past worm their way to the surface with devastating consequences. I really enjoyed being able to revisit the show as well because it was the first time I had seen it at the Apollo, and so I was able to take in a little more of the story that had passed me by first time round, and really appreciate the growing sense of tragedy about it all, especially knowing what the final destination was. There’s really not a weak link here: Stephen Campbell Moore and Jemima Rooper put in sensational supporting performances, especially considering the weightiness of Suchet and Wanamaker. But what really shines through is the intricate level of detail that one is able to take in with the occasional close ups."
516,516,Ought To Be Clowns,26/02/2018,Ian,Trust, Gate,"Between the Mandarin lessons and the sleep masks, the tequila shots and extended yoga, there’s an awful lot going on in Trust. A hell of a lot. But given that the last time Jude Christian directed a show here at the Gate she put two actual piglets onstage, it should come as little surprise that she’s challenging us once again. Plus the play’s German, so of course it’s batshit. From the minute you walk into the Gate, having been handed your guide to the art installation and gingerly stepping over the Roomba that’s beavering away, we know we’re not in Kansas any more. Or Notting Hill. Or anywhere the likes of Billers or DomCav will consider safe. And over the next 100 minutes, Christian experiments with this theatrical space in breathtaking ways, performing in the play as well as a kind of guide on its bewildering path. Written by Falk Richter (“one of the most important German playwrights on his generation” doncha know) and translated by Maja Zade, Trust seeks to explode the myth of modern capitalism through the lens of a collapsing relationship (Pia Laborde Noguez’s Lea and Zephryn Taitte’s Stefan). It might have been 14 years, it might have been 3 weeks, the work of Japanese-Icelandic social systems analyst Atsushi Lyngursvötsson might be more significant than anyone realised, you might never even know."
517,517,Ought To Be Clowns,01/10/2012,Ian,Bérénice, Donmar Warehouse,"The quote above is not actually from Alan Hollinghurst’s new version of Racine’s 1670 play Bérénice, but to be honest, no lines from it stuck in my head long enough over a post-show drink for me to record them and thus we have Days of our Lives… The reason that that came into my mind is because the predominant image of Lucy Osborne’s striking design of Josie Rourke’s production is of streams of sand tumbling from the ceiling even as we enter the auditorium, which has been partially reconfigured into the round, with stalls right being shifted 45 degrees to where the stage usually is but the circle seats remaining where they are. Bérénice has long been in love with Titus, but as she is a Palestinian queen and he is the new Emperor of Rome, theirs is not an easy romance. He decides to finally take her as his wife now that power is his but when he discovers that the Roman public are not that keen on the prospect of a foreign queen, Titus is forced to weigh his personal feelings against his imperial duties. He sends his best friend Antiochus to comfort Bérénice though it soon becomes apparent that he is also in love with her and so a tangle of pained feelings and unfulfilled passion plays out between the trio. Hollinghurst’s novels have been a mainstay on my bookshelf since I was a teenager and I am a huge fan of his but I can’t say that I liked the text here. Racine’s Alexandrine meter has been replaced with an unrhymed pentameter that sometimes felt ungainly and even brutal, its heightened mood coming across as a little too stiff and artificial, as epitomised by Dominic Rowan’s opening expository speech to himself. Caveats about final previews aside, Rowan’s Antiochus was a big disappointment, all the more so for the strength of his recent turn in A Doll’s House. Here he was strangely emotionless, frequently feeling awkward and looking odd in a misjudged costume and a hairstyle that makes no concession to the period of the play.  Stephen Campbell Moore fares better as Titus (and suits a beard very nicely) caught on the horns of his dilemma and connecting well with Anne-Marie Duff’s titular character. It is a welcome return to this intimate stage for Duff, whose presence often threatens to turn the play into something gripping. Her performance, another in a striking red dress, is measuredly impassioned and certainly accomplished but ultimately not enough to overcome the sterility of what should be the emotional drama.      And though it looks remarkable, I’m not sure that Osborne’s design achieves that much. The timbered staircase looks impressive (if a little rickety) but is so inflexible that the tramping up and down it soon becomes repetitive; the conversion into the round isn’t really exploited in any discernible manner (although to be fair, it could have been – we just couldn’t see what, if anything, was happening in the newly found space under our circle seats!) and the playing space is consequently very limited; and even the shifting sands are ultimately exposed as a piece of theatrical excess rather than being imbued with meaning. For a play and a production that is so stripped back, it was surprising to feel such a lack of emotional intensity all around and consequently it became something of a struggle to concentrate on, a feeling evidently shared by a fair few others around us. Truth be told, I haven’t liked that much of the Donmar’s output since Rourke took over and once again, I found myself at odds with her artistic vision – I just can’t see what this play brings to contemporary theatre.   Nothing was happening at the place you couldn't see. It was just a strip of sand."
518,518,Ought To Be Clowns,15/07/2014,mag9l,Fathers and Sons, Donmar Warehouse,"Another day, another tale of people languishing in the dying embers of Imperial Russia, but Fathers and Sons – Brian Friel’s 1987 adaptation of Ivan Turgenev’s 1862 novel – has something special about it, which makes it truly stand out from the crowd. Much of this has to do with Lyndsey Turner’s sterling production for the Donmar, her gift for marshalling large ensembles to the absolute best of their abilities coming to the fore once again and smoothing over any potential weaknesses in the play itself."
519,519,Ought To Be Clowns,01/06/2019,Ian,Dinner is Coming, The Vaults,"Stepping into the world of immersive experiences as a reviewer can be a tricky business. Given the sums of money that can be charged and the subjectiveness of your time there, to be able to put one’s hand on one’s heart and say you should put your hand on your wallet is rife with difficulty. I had one of my all-time greatest adventures on my first trip on You Me Bum Bum Train and my one and only venture to Secret Cinema had a moment of unforgettable pure magic but ask me about value for money, for you, and I’m stumped. Which is a long-winded way of saying you should take this review with a pinch of salt. Although you won’t need to add any salt because the cooking here at Dinner is Coming is really, really good. If you’ve been wondering what you should eat for dinner look no further! Designed and prepared onsite by Chavdar Todorov, Steven Estevez and their team, this is the kind of meal that comes close to justifying the ticket price alone. I always thought life was too short to roast a cauliflower but not any more, the slow-cooked lamb shoulder is melt-in-your-mouth delicious and yet somehow it is the salad that I remember the most – courgette, lettuce, beetroot and peas in a pesto-flecked dressing that makes every ingredient truly sing. 
These treats are all part of the banquet (3 courses, vegan and veggie friendly) celebrating the marriage of Jaffery Bearathon, and Margarine Trywell, a feast which forms the centrepiece of Dinner is Coming. We’re allocated to a house on arrival (Trywell, Bannister or Tarragon) and as the wordplay suggests, we’re in a knowingly parodic version of Game of Thrones as people fight to sit on the Wooden Throne. Across the evening, there’s murders to be solved, secrets to be discovered, allegiances to be swapped, wine to be won and as with the better examples of immersive theatre, you’re free to participate as much or as little as you want."
520,520,Ought To Be Clowns,27/10/2014,Ian,The Wild Duck, Belvoir Sydney at Barbican,"You’ve got to love an adaptation that ruffles a few feathers and Simon Stone and Chris Ryan’s take on The Wild Duck for Belvoir Sydney certainly does that, quite literally in one case as the show features a live duck that paddles the stage in a striking opening image. Part of the Barbican’s International Ibsen festival, this is a startlingly contemporary look at the Norwegian classic which strips it to its spine (as Stone says in a programme note) and reimagines it significantly as a modern fable about secrets and lies (and a duck). Encased in the confines of Ralph Myer’s clear perspex box and dramatically illuminated by Niklas Pajanti’s utterly complete lighting design, the family drama of the Ekdals and the Werles play out to levels of intensity normally associated with Greek tragedy. And under this scrutiny, there’s nowhere for them, or us, to hide – the private grief of Anita Hegh’s catatonic Gina is exposed like a raw wound for nigh on 20 minutes, the uncontrollable anger of Brendan Cowell’s Hjalmar literally bounces off the walls, the target for Hedwig’s shotgun practice is quite simply the audience. And released from formal representations of place, Stone is free to elide precise shards of scenes with monitors giving times down to the minute to offer a nominally formal structure. But more often this is a production that demands to be felt as events bleed into and feed into each other as familial harmony slowly cracks and then completely shatters under pressure. Stefan Gregory’s vividly constructed score is crucial here, jagged phrases of elegant strings giving way to crashing rock at the key moment as light and sound floods the box and emotion floods the heart."
521,521,Ought To Be Clowns,26/11/2009,Ian,La Clique at the Roundhouse,,"Described as a “heady cocktail of cabaret, new burlesque, circus sideshow and contemporary variety”, what makes La Clique unique is that no two shows are the same. They have a rotating roster of entertainers and performers with a variety of tricks and stunts which ensures each evening has its own special spin. It is set up like a circus in the round, with various options for seating in different rings: chairs at ringside, cabaret tables with waitress service, standing, and of course, regular seats, which means you can pick what kind of evening you would like to have, a nice touch. And so to the show: it is a rapid-fire collection of turns ranging from acrobatics, illusions, songs and insane roller-skating antics. Highlights for me were Carl-Einar Häckner’s hysterical Swedish illusionist who had me in tears of laughter each time he came on, Ursula Martinez’s highly revealing striptease with disappearing handkerchief and the incredible roller-skating acrobatics of the Skating Willers which quite literally needs to be seen to be believed. Incidentally, having never seen any kind of nudity on stage until the weekend, 2 of the last 3 shows I’ve seen have now stolen my innocence from me! The changes between the acts were seamless, big credit to the backstage crew for executing these with lightning speed and efficiency, and this helped to maintain the party atmosphere which permeated the entire venue from the moment the lights went down."
522,522,Ought To Be Clowns,16/02/2012,Ian,BBC HD Film Shorts,,"A bit of random thing that only came to my attention because of a kind soul on Twitter, this collection of five short films from the last few years presented by the BBC Film Network and BBC HD, offered the opportunity to notch up bonus appearances from Andrew Scott and Rafe Spall, as well as appreciating some up and coming filmmaking talent. Scott’s film is Silent Things in which he plays Jake, a guy with Asperger’s who strikes up an unlikely camaraderie with a quirky teenager, Georgia Groome’s Amy who challenges him to test his boundaries with mixed results and which in turn also threatens his friendship with Charlotte, also autistic and who resents the closeness that Jake is able to achieve with others. Written by Rob Brown and Edward Jackson, it is small but perfectly formed and elevated by all three performances from its leads, not just Scott. Predictably he is excellent, unshaven and more unkempt than we’re used to seeing him, his is a performance of great subtlety leading us to empathise strongly with Jake’s predicament. Antonia Campbell-Hughes’ Charlotte suffers more severely and so is less able to socialise, her bluntness still sensitively portrayed though and the self-determined drive neatly suggested. Groome is also good and altogether, it made for an engaging short piece. Modern Life is Rubbish was also amongst my favourites here, Rafe Spall and Rebecca Night starring as a recently split-up couple who are going through the traumatic experience of dividing their music collection and ruminating on their relationship, their potential future friendship and what might have been. It is very well written, Philip Gawthorne picking up on so many of the tiny awkward details like attending the same social events after the split, being brutally honest about the things you didn’t like about the other and the ease with which one can fall back into intimacy without even thinking about it. And well performed too, Spall’s traditional music obsessive railing against greatest hits collections and the very existence of the iPod, his bluffness not quite able to mask his breaking heart as Rebecca Night tries to remain pragmatic as the one who has moved out and so not wanting to spend any more time there than is necessary. The other 3 films were not quite as successful for me, and not just because they didn’t have actors I particularly like, honest! Stephanie Zari and Samantha Whitaker’s Marigolds tried a little too hard for my liking, both pushing it with its subject matter of an over-bearing mother who se relationship to her son is close to unnatural and threatens to spill over when he returns home for a visit, and with Zari’s direction which is overly arty without real effect, the final tracking shot felt painful too me. Jane Guernier is intriguing as the mother but too little is left unsaid or unexplored to really make it work. Babak Anvari’s Bafta-nominated Two and Two is a slightly surreal fable of a tale set in a (Iranian?) school where the regime institute unreasonable change with tragic consequences but it was a little too obscure for me. Chris Dundon’s Bro was the best of the rest, a sweetly affirming drama of a young teenager trapped on a dull council estate and overburdened with the responsibility of caring for his brother who is suffering from Fragile X syndrome as his mother goes out to work leaving him to cope."

524,524,Ought To Be Clowns,30/09/2018,Ian,The Lesson, Hope Theatre,"Eugène Ionesco’s La Leçon is the French equivalent of The Mousetrap – it’s been running at the Théâtre de la Huchette in Paris since February 1957. British theatres have been a little less enthusiastic about the French-Romanian playwright over the years but following the NT’s Exit the King, Matthew Parker’s Hope Theatre is also redressing that with this English-language production of The Lesson.  And though Ionesco is known as an absurdist, there’s something directly compelling and disturbing here. Sheetal Kapoor’s bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Pupil turns up for instruction with Roger Alborough’s Professor but her precocious confidence soon takes a battering as lessons in arithmetic and philology dissolve into abstracted nonsense and he gets increasingly angry at her inability to keep up.   Watching balefully from the sidelines is Joan Potter’s Maid – “Monsieur must do what he thinks best” – and as well she should, as what is happening is less education than indoctrination.  Donald Watson’s translation spares us nothing of the way in which this man abuses language to wield as a kind of weapon against his charge, breaking down her resolve, ignoring her pleas for help – in the current climate, it’s a power dynamic that is horribly resonant. Rachael Ryan’s staging in the round and Chris McDonnell’s lighting rarely finding true darkness also means that this production interrogates our role here. We’re more than audience members, we’re witnesses to something, maybe even complicit too as our reactions are plain to see. As the play gets darker and darker, fewer people carry on laughing but you do notice those who do and you just wonder…you know which side of The Handmaid’s Tale they’d end up in. "
525,525,Ought To Be Clowns,22/11/2017,Ian,Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, Apollo,"When Everybody’s Talking About Jamie made its debut in Sheffield earlier this year (here’s my review), hopes were high for a transfer, the news of which took a little time to be confirmed, leaving me worried it would suffer the fate of the gorgeous Flowers for Mrs Harris. But this sparkling new show has arrived in the West End and now sits on Shaftesbury Avenue at the Apollo as a proud piece of new British musical theatre and an equally proud piece of LGBT+ storytelling. Written by Dan Gillespie Sells (music) and Tom MacRae (book and lyric) and adapted from a BBC documentary, Jamie casts off the archetypal coming out and gay bashing stories (though not completely ignoring them) in favour of a main narrative about an out and proud teen who is insistent that he’s going to his high school prom in drag but only belatedly coming to realise that his determination to be fierce has consequences for those who love him. And on second viewing, it was the idea of family being the ones you choose to surround yourself with that really resonated. Josie Walker is outstanding as Margaret, the single mother who has scrimped and saved and sacrificed so much, trying her best to understanding towards a son whose journey of self-discovery seems to be taking him further away from her. And the relationship with Mina Anwar’s best friend Ray – simultaneously comic relief and a pseudo-parent figure for Jamie – is beautifully drawn. And the camaraderie between the local drag queens shouldn’t be underestimated either, from Phil Nichol’s Loco Chanel to James Gillan’s Tray Sophisticay. For all their bitchy one-liners to one another, you just know they’d defend each other to the limit and that’s another form of family to which Jamie is drawn, as he sets about establishing his own drag persona. John McCrea’s title character is a wonderfully self-possessed streak of petulant precocity and maintains our sympathies even when he’s all me me me… I’d also forgotten just how funny Everybody’s Talking About Jamie is. Directed by Jonathan Butterell, MacRae’s script is jam-packed with zingers from pretty much everyone, although the Emmeline Pankhurst / Beyoncé analogy stole it for me. And Gillespie Sells’ pop-influenced score is an absolute breath of fresh air, from Walker’s elegiac torch song ‘If I Met Myself Again’ to McCrea’s catwalk strut through ‘Walk of Art’, Tamsin Carroll’s inspired Betty Boo-esque rap midway through ‘Don’t Even Know It’ to the quiet beauty of Lucie Shorthouse’s ‘It Means Beautiful’. Shorthouse’s Pritti, Jamie’s best friend, is also worthy of mention, emblematic of the matter-of-fact diversity in this ensemble, and a brilliant – and all too rare – example of an everyday Muslim character. This is a musical for today, reflecting the Britain of today – you really need to go see it now!"
526,526,Ought To Be Clowns,20/06/2016,mag9l,Wild, Hampstead,"It’s a truth universally acknowledged that Mike Bartlett is one of our finest contemporary writers and so it is pleasing to see that his new play Wild sees his reunite with creatives with whom he has had great success. Director James Macdonald was at the helm of the intense inter-relationships of Cock and designer Miriam Buether has reveled in transforming spaces such as the then-Cottesloe for Earthquakes in London and the Almeida for Game and both are on top form once again here. At first glance, it might not look like Buether has done much to the Hampstead’s main stage but you can rest assured that she’ll have tipped the world on its axis by the end of the play, and what a fierce play it is. Bartlett has turned his gaze to the realm of information security as he imagines the experience of an Edward Snowden-like figure called Andrew who stuck two fingers up to the state by releasing sensitive data online. Sequestered in a Moscow hotel room on the run, he’s left awaiting his fate.  I like Bartlett’s writing when his focus is on the macro-level but I love it when it drills down to the micro, the sheer intensity of people just talking, wielding power unknown over each other. And that’s what we get here as Andrew is visited first by a woman named George who assures him she’s the contact he’s been waiting for, to put him in touch with ‘him’ (a man ‘trapped’ in a foreign embassy in London…). An hour later after she’s gone though, a man named George turns up claiming he’s actually the contact. And so Jack Farthing’s Andrew gets increasingly strung out under the barrage of mutual questioning from both Caoilfhionn Dunne’s superbly cajoling Woman and John Mackay’s more gnomic Man – who can he trust, who can really secure his exile, is the threat of assassination that real, why did he do what he did, how does he feel about the loved ones he’s had to leave behind, was it worth it. And most crucially, who can he trust when his enemy is apparently the state? "
527,527,Ought To Be Clowns,21/03/2019,Ian,Downstate, National Theatre,"Yeesh! Bruce Norris’ Downstate arrives at the National Theatre as a co-production with Steppenwolf Theatre Company and as you might expect from this award-winning agent provocateur, this play about paedophilia and rehabilitation is frequently shocking in its daring and detail. Norris asks the question what should society do with those who have been found guilty of sex crimes against minors but having raised the unconscionable spectre of such people, proceeds to try and make us care for them, disaggregating the individual stories from the amorphous, horrific whole.  He sets Downstate in an Illinois group home where four registered sex offenders are trying to figure out what kind of life they can live in a society that reflexively abhors them. Their crimes differ, but so too do their conceptions of them, the rationalisations they have for their actions (often described in unsparing detail)."
528,528,Ought To Be Clowns,06/10/2010,Ian,Hamlet, Crucible,"So part two of the Hamlet week saw me making my first ever visit to Sheffield to the Crucible Theatre where director Paul Miller has reunited with frequent collaborator John Simm in tackling Shakespeare’s epic. I have resisted making any comparisons with the two productions in this review and tried my best to approach the writing of this review as if I had not seen the other. This Hamlet is very much back to basics, very few props and frippery onstage, so that quite often what we are seeing is simply just a group of actors acting. And whilst on the one hand that was nice to see, on the other, it did mean that there was a whole lot of just standing around and the limited emotional palette with which they had to work meant that too often the connections just weren’t there between the characters, Ophelia and Laertes might as well have been strangers for example. Nor was there the real sense of where we were in terms of what is happening in and around this Elsinore: Tom Scutt’s effective split-level set with its changing facades was nicely done if palatial rather than castle-like (and the falling snow harked back a bit much to Law’s Hamlet for me) but elsewhere there was no real concession to the state of war apart from a cannon shot or two towards the end and the programme note that we were actually in 19th century Eastern Europe seemed to bear no relation to anything on the stage. Part of the problem lies in the staging: because the stage is bare, the soliloquies end up being delivered just as the rest of the text, there’s no differentiation, and combined with the limited range that Simm displays, it all sadly becomes a bit samey. At times, this is just right, the strong sarcastic humour displayed is brilliant when dealing with the duplicity of his friends or his encounters with his mother which crackles with cruelty and the verse is spoken with great precise clarity, but there’s little sense of Hamlet’s journey, of his wildly differing states and in particular his grief.
 
John Nettles did well as the Ghost, some vocal effects combined with an ethereal note in his voice was a nice touch, but I found his Claudius often difficult to watch, his awkward movements and strangely pitched delivery was frankly disturbing at times. Barbara Flynn (who, in a piece of completely useless trivia, is the neighbour of my current, ever-gracious landlords, I can see her garden from my room!) also underwhelmed slightly, never really displaying enough emotion aside from guilt, but I did like Michelle Dockery’s dignified Ophelia, just a sweet girl mad with grief for her father, Hugh Ross’ amusing Polonius (he’s also the grave-digger) and Colin Tierney’s ever-faithful Horatio, a true compatriot for Simm.
 
Costumes were very swanky, some gorgeous dresses for both Gertrude and Ophelia, sharp suits for some of the men as well but they possibly went too far in kitting Rosencrantz and Guildenstern out in very modish gear but ultimately making them look like catalogue models for Zara (although who knows, maybe this is was 19th century Eastern European men dressed like) and I wasn’t keen on the capes worn by the courtesans either.
 
All in all, I was a little underwhelmed by this production. I admired the ethic behind it, of stripped back authenticity which suited the thrust stage of the Crucible with the audience on three sides and everyone being nicely close to the action, but it was also a big ask given the resistance to cutting too much of the text. The longer it went on, the more exposed it felt in not actually presenting enough of a fully realised world in which a wider emotional palette could have been used and consequently it ran dangerously close to being boring at times. Hmm, it sounds a bit drab, Ian. Don't think I'll bother making the journey up for this one, much as I ♥ Hamlet… Another trip to the NT production will have to do!"
529,529,Ought To Be Clowns,17/05/2012,Ian,The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe, 360 Theatre,"Aiming to be one of the theatrical events of the summer (although it has always seemed more of a Christmassy story to me), Rupert Goold has turned his customary directorial flair to his own adaptation of CS Lewis’ quintessential English classic The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. But in choosing to mount this production in the threesixty theatre in the grounds of Kensington Gardens, a rather unforgiving purpose-built circular tent, the show faces an uphill struggle from the start to try and create the sense of theatrical magic and wonder that is needed to transport us through the wardrobe along with the four Pevensie children. NB this was a preview performance. The show is clearly aiming to be a family-friendly spectacular, the varied inhabitants of Narnia are evoked through a cross between Lion King puppetry and Cirque du Soleil physicality – imaginatively done if that’s your sort of thing, though readers of this blog will know it is not mine, at all – but the soulless atmosphere of the space leads to a rather sterile feel which the cast rarely overcome. Even Adam Cork’s music fails to get the pulse racing (the website says ‘the production is a play but does feature some live music and a pre-recorded fully orchestrated soundtrack’ so we’re clearly in “play with songs” territory rather than fully fledged “musical”) as the rather anodyne songs make little lasting impression and the muddy sound design meant there was precious little lyrical clarity. The staging, in the round, creates both limitations and opportunities and whilst there are attempts to address the former, one can’t help but feel that the latter aren’t exploited as fully as they could be.  Though technically sophisticated, the circular stage with its revolves and reveals cannot hide the fact that the company have nowhere to go but round and round (or in some case up and down). The upper walls of the tent are intermittently used as a 360 degree cyclorama with clever and sometimes beautiful animation work from Chris Randall, but this was too often just decorative rather than fully integrated into the show which was a shame as when it worked well, it was one of the few times the venue choice made sense. There’s currently a curious quality to much of the acting, perhaps the result of being part of such an extravaganza or perhaps more a personal reaction to having such a close affinity to the story and these characters, that may well settle as the run progresses and the venue’s idiosyncracies better assimilated. Sally Dexter’s cruelly seductive White Witch is vampily well played along with David Rubin’s vicious Maugrim, and her summoning of her dark army is the highlight of the production and Sophie-Louise Dann and Paul Barnhill make a mostly engaging, hyperactive pair of Beavers. But the four Pevensies could do with a tad more gumption: Jonny Weldon’s brattish Edmund is closest where Philip Labey’s Peter needs a little more command as the heir presumptive of Cair Paravel. In the end though, the lack of atmosphere from the venue was the biggest problem for me and as the magic failed to weave its spell, my attention turned to the little niggling things. If there’s three people operating Aslan, why doesn’t his mouth move whilst David Suchet’s prerecorded voice growls his way through the lines? Why does Lucy fly her way into Narnia the first time? Can I sue under the Trade Descriptions Act for the complete misrepresentation of the poster image – that Aslan does not look like a tree…?! Why does CS Lewis have such a downer on Susan? How many times do we have to see clarinet-playing animals before it officially becomes a trend? (The Heart of Robin Hood was the first one FYI) How did I feel about there being a not-cheap merchandise stall?"
530,530,Ought To Be Clowns,06/10/2013,Ian,Perfect Match, Watford Palace Theatre,"Part of Watford Palace Theatre’s Ideal World Season, Gary Owen’s new play Perfect Match looks at the role that the internet has to play in our relationships – whether forming new ones through cast-iron guaranteed dating services or shaking up long-existing partnerships that may or may not have gone stale. Anna and Joe have been together for nine years and Lorna and Aaron six, but when a computer algorithm declares Anna and Aaron to be perfect soulmates, they meet up for a dirty sojourn in Stevenage, declare the connection is indeed real and decide to ditch their other halves and elope to Gretna Green.  Kelly Hotten’s Anna is a wonderful combination of sweetness and steel – caringly concerned that no-one is too upset but absolutely determined to get her own way. And Tom Berish is often hilarious as the dumbly delicious Aaron, most amusing in his blokish behaviour. But dumping someone else for your perfect match isn’t quite as easy as all that and the pair, in their vastly different ways have to extricate themselves from the lives of the people with whom they have spent years and Joe and Lorna are not about to make it easy for them. Eva Jane Willis’ professional debut is a vivid delight as the brutally blunt Lorna and Ken Nwosu’s Joe quietly captures the sympathetic centre of the story. For his is the mundane reality that can’t compete with the ideal world, not even with money as everything changes. Owen makes several suggestions about the way technology has altered the way we interact with the world – how people will casually compose a text message whilst in a conversation with someone, someone else is learning meditation techniques via mp3s, and at the heart of the play is the gospel seriousness with which people take what they read online. There’s something moving yet disturbing about the way in which these people crave certainty in a fast-changing world, even as their very actions are causing yet more turmoil. "

532,532,Ought To Be Clowns,04/09/2011,Ian,Ragtime, Landor,"Earlier this year, it did seem that the Landor had a bit of a curse as a range of issues forced programme changes on more than one occasion, but they do seem to have hit their stride now. I didn’t catch Carousel but it seemed to go down well and that was followed an incomparable production of The Hired Man, probably one of the best shows of the year so far, so there was no pressure resting on the show following at all: Ragtime. Directed by Artistic Director Robert McWhir, Ragtime continues the Landor’s strong trend of delivering top-quality fringe musical theatre with unfeasibly large casts: over 20 people make up this ensemble! I caught a preview on a Sunday afternoon as a ticket for a tenner deal popped up on Twitter (if you’re on Twitter then think about following theatres you like as similar deals are frequently posted up there). And I am pleased to report that Ragtime comes close to the heights of The Hired Man in creating a stunning piece of emotional drama, enlivened with some perky playfulness and all wrapped in a deliciously beautiful score (and funnily enough set in a similar time period). The opening number is a thing of pure joy, managing to cover the thematic scope of the play and fully introduce the three families around which the story turns. Terrence McNally’s book is based on a novel by E.L. Doctorow set at the turn of the twentieth century in a New York bustling with huge social change. A cookie-cutter WASP family in quiet New Rochelle have their lives turned upside down when Mother finds an abandoned baby boy who is black. Against the prevailing social attitudes, she takes in the child and the mother too, Sarah and when the father, a ragtime pianist called Coalhouse Walker Jnr, finally tracks them down, he sets about wooing Sarah back as the mindset of this white family is completely opened up. Added into the mix is the arrival of a Jewish immigrant from Latvia with his daughter in search of opportunity and a new, better life. The stories of all three families collide and intersect in different ways as recognisable historical figures weave in and out as well: immigrant-done-good Harry Houdini, political activist Emma Goldman, Henry Ford, JP Morgan, Booker T Washington amongst others, as the families share out both happy and tragic endings. It is all rather weighty stuff but the fast-moving montage of scenes is given a deftness of touch here by McWhir’s direction, enlivened here with some sparky and fun choreography, and there with some spectacular performances. Rosalind James is simply sensational as Sarah, she made me cry three times in the first half alone, with a vocal performance thick with raw passion and sounding just beautiful, especially when teamed up with Kurt Kansley’s Coalhouse, who plays the shift to a darker tone excellently. Louisa Lydell as Mother also delivers the good as the upper-class woman who is liberated by the changes that happen in her life and relishes the chance to let her strong voice fill the room, again complemented well by her male counterpart, in this case Alexander Evans. There was a nicely quirky relationship that built up between John Barr’s kindly Tateh, determined to make it somehow, and Judith Paris’ strident activist Emma, both singing well as did indeed the whole cast. Employing such a huge cast in such a small space however, does result in some awkward bits of crowding and poor blocking: too often my view of climactic moments was obscured by the backs of ensemble members especially as the stage doesn’t provide enough levels to let the leads really stand out from the crowd. Space is obviously limited but it did really hamper some key moments for me so perchance this could be looked at before opening night? And though I could see the logic behind the changing silhouette-based set design, I didn’t feel it had quite enough polish to be as effective as it needed to be. Stephen Flaherty’s music, with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, takes in a little of the period music from which the title is taken, but also incorporates elements of cakewalk, gospel, power ballads and in one case a Chicago-aping courtroom number. Under George Dyer’s musical direction, the small band play effortlessly and the combined sound of a full-voiced ensemble in the intimate Landor frequently makes the hairs stand on end. It is interesting that three of the best musicals of recent months have all been set in a similar time period: Parade, The Hired Man and now Ragtime, none of them fulfilling the stereotypical image of musicals that many carry with them. In dealing so effectively with dramatic subjects and giving us scores rich in musical history, the case is surely made for taking fringe musical theatre more seriously.  At a time when there’s much gnashing of teeth at early closures of bigger shows like Love Never Dies, Betty Blue Eyes and Lend Me A Tenor, there’s not enough attention being paid to the smaller picture. When it comes to straight plays, a huge amount of respect is accorded to ‘smaller’ venues like the Almeida, the Bush, the Gate, even the Donmar whereas only the Menier seems to have made a similar leap on the musical side of things: it is surely time that we celebrated, and respected, theatres like the Union and indeed the Landor much more: shows like these should not be taken for granted."
533,533,Ought To Be Clowns,21/01/2019,Ian,Violet, Charing Cross Theatre,"There’s much to like about this production of Jeanine Tesori and  Brian Crawley’s musical Violet, not least a winning performance from Kaisa Hammarlund and a striking set design from Morgan Large which makes the most of a cleverly reconfigured Charing Cross Theatre. The stage has been moved to the centre of the long auditorium which dramatically ups the intimacy of the space. And Hammarlund – recently in another of Tesori’s musicals Fun Home – is a warmly magnetic presence as the central character Violet, a young woman who journeys from North Carolina to Oklahoma in the hope of a cure for the facial disfigurement that shapes her life. Tesori’s score picks intelligently at a range of influences that characterise the geographical journey, but Crawley’s book – based on Doris Betts’ short story The Ugliest Pilgrim – doesn’t quite map out as thrilling an emotional journey, a lack of narrative force to really connect us to Violet’s plight as she engages the attention of two Vietnam-bound soldiers."

535,535,Ought To Be Clowns,20/02/2012,Ian,Axis,,"Even within the constraints of a short piece of drama, playwrights often think and write big, but not always to the greatest effect, and so it felt a little bit with Diana Son’s Axis, one of the plays making up the second part of the Tricycle’s The Bomb – a partial history. Starting off in a White House strategy room, two advisers try to come up with a sexy soundbite that will help sell Dubya’s aggressive post 9/11 strategy, we then flip ten years into the future in North Korea where two members of the government discuss what things might be like under their new inexperienced leader Kim Jong-Un. Both sections have their merits: the idea that something as powerful and definitive as the ‘Axis of Evil’ rhetoric is something that could have been whipped by speech-writers and spin doctors has a horribly persuasive currency but it felt a lost opportunity for the revelation that this policy threw away the considerable diplomatic efforts of the previous administration who had come close to buying out the North Koreans’ nuclear programme in exchange for aid to just be used as a post-script caption. And where the 2012 discussion of the huge uncertainty around their untried new leader does look at the repercussions of this hardening of the position on both sides, especially on worsening the poverty in North Korea, there’s an almost slapstick tone which undermined the seriousness of the subject."
536,536,Ought To Be Clowns,17/02/2011,Ian,The Blue Room, Guildhall at the Bridewell Theatre,"I would have loved to have gone up to Sheffield to catch one or more of the plays in the David Hare season currently playing, there’s some really interesting casting and I haven’t experienced much of Hare’s work at all, but two trips there last month and a tight schedule this month means it doesn’t look likely, so I had to look closer to home. And almost as if it was meant to be, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama obliged with a production of The Blue Room at the Bridewell. A free adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler’s La Ronde (which seems an endlessly popular play for reinterpretations), this show is perhaps most (in)famous for the Donmar Warehouse’s production in which Iain Glen and Nicole Kidman covered all the roles and set certain critics’ flames alight. The show features a daisy-chain of 10 anonymous characters in endless sexual encounters, one having sex with another until the final character meets the first and the circle is completed. Hare kept this structure in his version but moved to the action from fin-de-siècle Vienna to “one of the great cities of the world, in the present day” and had 2 actors play all the parts, demanding great versatility in portraying the multiple takes on lust, sex, class, power. This version though has a different person playing each part. Performed in this way allows for a nice showcasing opportunity for the set of 10 actors but it also highlighted the slightness to the play in its collection of short scenes of varying quality and dialogue that seems to oscillate between the modernity of Hare and Schnitzler’s turn-of-the-century attitudes in a rather random manner which didn’t always sit so well. There’s a nice recurring theme of how people can modify their behaviour when they are with different people and how sex can used to gain all manners of things but ultimately the play felt somewhat superficial. But given the constraints of Hare’s adaptation, a fine job was achieved by cast and crew. I particularly enjoyed Cai Brigden’s arrogant rich student turned starry-eyed romantic by his married lover, Kat Seelos as said richly-voiced lover, warmly amused by the puppyish attentions of her lover and coldly amused by the attitudes to women of her traditionalist politician husband and Rachael Deering’s actress, playful in her relationships with both playwrights and fans. Tom Daley’s direction did well to make each of the scenes throb with some kind of emotional intensity in the build-up to the sex, well portrayed in darkened slow motion, and in the post-coital. He also did well to keep the many transitions smoothly effective to the tune of Mikko Gordon’s pulsing modern soundtrack, mixing and remixing well-known tunes, covering the realignment of designer Signe Beckmann’s Perspex boxes into endlessly flexible permutations. And I loved the effect of the tumbling fluorescent tubes in one corner, fading from colour to colour, it was almost pretty enough to watch on its own and credit should go to lighting designer Robert Dyer, still a student at Guildhall but demonstrating a talent to watch out for. If you put your back into it, I reckon you can make it up to Sheffield."
537,537,Ought To Be Clowns,26/01/2018,Ian,Tumulus, VAULT Festival,"Chemsex is one of those subjects that always seems to pop up at festivals and sure enough, in week 1 of the VAULT we find a new play on the very subject by Christopher Adams. But with a sparkingly fresh and darkly witty take and some intelligent and imaginative direction from Matt Steinberg, Tumulus emerges as a cracking piece of theatre, a “chilling queer noir” that entertains as much as it elucidates. Anthony is well and truly addicted to the chemsex scene in London. He’s holding down his job as an assistant curator at the British Museum just about fine, though that promotion always seems to elude him, as his evenings and weekends are taken up with chasing the next amazing high, the next unmissable party, the next insatiable guy. This high-functioning addict has his certainties shaken though when his one of his latest hook-ups turns up dead on Hampstead Heath. Adams’ masterstroke is to filter his story through a noir crime genre that never takes itself too seriously. So in Ciarán Owens’ hands, Anthony’s investigations take on a faintly hilarious quality (“with a swish of my raincoat, I left the police station”, “I am myself not yet 33”) even though the appearance of a second body twists the plot into darker, more murderous territory. It also provides much needed occasional lightness as Owens’ spares us nothing of the underlying anguish of this addict."

541,541,Ought To Be Clowns,18/03/2016,mag9l,Something Something Lazarus, King’s Head,"It’s always interesting to get feedback on my blogging though the emotions that drive people to write tend to be quite forcible… thus the latest missive I received castigated me strongly for not supporting new musical theatre writing in giving Miss Atomic Bomb a less than favourable review. Regardless of the notion that I do usually aim to be constructive in my criticism, I’d argue that challenging the writers with external opinions is supporting them, many a musical has been rewritten and rewritten and so blind praise does little to help, especially when the material is so formally unadventurous. Which is a long-winded way of saying I love the concept of what Broken Cabaret are doing in Something Something Lazarus even if I didn’t completely love the show itself. Described as “a new (kind of) musical”, writers John Myatt and Simon Arrowsmith are doing no less than shifting paradigms of musical theatre to create something something new. The show opens in a bit of a blur – Vee and Della, employees of the Midnight Sun cabaret, are haphazardly rehearsing for tonight’s new show, owner Daniel is on the edge of a nervous breakdown and his lover Jay is wandering around in his pants. Events take a little while to come to a climax under Dan Phillips’ direction but boy, do they ever. For a struggle between Daniel and Jay turns into a life and death situation, and this (kind of) musical transmogrifies into a surreal cabaret. And suddenly the storytelling is electrified, the heightened theatricality allowing a bold exploration of the relationships between all four of them, the change in form permitting a diversification of the musical palette. It’s audaciously unexpected and surprisingly successful as Daniel Cech-Lucas’ Jay becomes an emcee from the ether, flirting with any and every audience member, lapping up any unimpressed faces with an alluring sangfroid."
542,542,Ought To Be Clowns,12/10/2018,Ian,Dracula, Brockley Jack,"On National Coming Out day, there’s something rather delicious about the first act climax of Dracula being set to a haunting remix of Britney’s ‘Toxic’. He may be fangs-deep in Lucy and longing to make Mina his countess but we all saw how taken he was by Jonathan as he set up for a shave. Love is love is love, right, or should that be a vein is a vein is a vein…  Arrows & Traps have turned their hand to horror before, with a fearlessly inventive take on Frankenstein which lit up the Brockley Jack last year. So adaptor/director Ross McGregor turning to Bram Stoker’s classic Dracula makes sense, not least as at offers ample opportunity to refresh its rather dustily antiquated take on gender.  And this is where the production shines brightest. Beatrice Vincent and Lucy Ioannou imbue Mina and Lucy with a spirited confidence that posits them as much more equal partners to the various men in their lives, of whom Conor Moss makes a wonderfully gentle Jonathan. And Cornelia Baumann makes for a marvellously vivid Renfield, the asylum inmate who finds herself susceptible to the mind control of the dark lord. McGregor also has fun with the novel’s epistolary style, the impressive scale of Francine Huin-Wah’s Gothic set design allowing for an epic sense of time and space to be evoked. And with Ben Jacobs’ lighting and Alistair Lax’s sound work establishing the creepiest of moods, this proves a sprightly adaptation, lead by the dangerously silky tones of Christopher Tester in a succession of dangerously slinky capes as Dracula (fun costume design from Odin Corie). "
543,543,Ought To Be Clowns,05/04/2014,mag9l,Two Into One, Menier Chocolate Factory,"The things I do for Josefina Gabrielle… Whilst I am more than happy to revisit the Chocolate Factory once Gabrielle joins up in the major cast change soon, I had to be dragged to the Menier Chocolate Factory to see her in Ray Cooney’s Two Into One, my natural aversion to farce meaning I was more than happy to give it a miss. But a cheap deal on tickets plus the promise of gin saw me head out on a Sunday and have the slightly depressing inevitability of my preconceptions being proven right. If we’re to believe scions of our national press, this is “a classic farce” and if we don’t like (or the genre as a whole), we’re “sourpusses…more to be pitied than censured”. Which says it all really. If you’re of a certain generation, as much of this audience was, and brought on a certain style of humour, then Ray Cooney will be right up your street. And a thirty year old political farce which makes no concession for the time past since it was written will more than likely have you chortling down the aisles. But this is dessicated comedy, paper-thin stuff that overly relies on hackneyed routines that even Russ Abbot would toss out as old hat. Surnames like Willey abound, comedy foreigners put on accents, old people strike kung fu moves…you get the idea. The dialogue is end-of-the-pier stuff at best that revels in being ‘saucy’ but is so utterly rooted in the past, such a relic from a bygone age that it almost feels redundant to call it out on it. It should probably be noted that Cooney directs his own play here, as well as starring in it."
544,544,Ought To Be Clowns,26/08/2013,Ian,Blue Stockings, Shakespeare’s Globe,"The experience of a groundling at the Globe can range from the sublime (Eve Best clasping your hand) to the ridiculous (standing for two and a half hour in the pouring rain) yet it is a unique kind of experience that always keeps me coming back for more. At £5 a ticket, it is the bargainous type of risk that is worth taking and with plays like Jessica Swale’s Blue Stockings, the dividends it pays forth make up for the sheer sogginess of the journey home. Swale is perhaps best known as a director, particularly for her inimitable takes on Restoration comedies but also for striking contemporary work of devastating precision but she now returns to Shakespeare’s Globe, where she directed 2010’s Bedlam, as a playwright with this, her first play.  The play is set in 1896 in Girton College, Cambridge which 20 years prior, became the first college in Britain to admit women. But though they can study, they are denied the right to graduate, their time at university leaving them with little but the stigma of being a “blue stocking”, a woman whose education was deemed unnatural and thus leaving her unmarriageable. Swale explores the year their right to graduate was finally put to the vote, following a group of four students as they are introduced to the novelties of university life, albeit segregated and belittled by the vast majority, where taking exams has to compete with the richer pleasures that a modicum of independence brings.  Swale adroitly mixes in this lightness to the more serious aspects of her storytelling and director John Dove executes it excellently. So whilst we witness Principal Welsh determinedly trying to dissociate Girton’s struggle from the more controversial cause of the suffragettes to try and keep the matter a potentially winnable one, we also see that the introduction of female students being allowed to study in the library was swiftly followed by the first incident of love notes being passed around. She also avoids simplifying the response of the male students of the time – respect is mixed with confusion, anger provoked by fear, the enormity of the societal change at hand never trivialised into neat soundbites. Ellie Piercy makes a strong presence as the central Tess, combining the joy of being allowed to exercise her mind fully with the heady delights of tumbling head over heels for her first love and struggling to reconcile the two. Tala Gouveia, Olivia Ross and Molly Logan offer a lovely mixture of vivaciousness and studiousness as her colleagues; Sarah MacRae brings a severity to their teacher Miss Blake, herself a former student but one who finds herself trapped by the strictures of academia as she longs to join up with the suffragettes; and Gabrielle Lloyd is movingly sincere as Welsh, a woman entirely dedicated to her cause and fully aware of the compromises that she, and her students, have to make in order to achieve their shared goal."
545,545,Ought To Be Clowns,07/12/2009,Ian,Cock, Royal Court,"Staged in the round upstairs at the Royal Court, inside a three tier plywood ring (which unfortunately put both me and my companion in mind of the set of Big Brother’s Big Mouth), the provocatively named Cock is a play which is performed without artifice, without props, just remarkably intense acting and the suggestive power of movement. Ben Whishaw plays John, a gay man tumbling out of a long term relationship with an older man, M (Andrew Scott) and finding unexpected solace in the arms of a woman, W (Katherine Parkinson). What follows is a messy struggle as John finds himself conflicted, not just with his fluctuating sexuality but also with issues of identity and the nature of the relationship that he wants to pursue, whether that be with M or W.  As John, Whishaw is good here, frustratingly indecisive but charismatic enough to carry it off and Parkinson shows that her comic skills (as honed in Channel 4’s The I.T. Crowd) are truly excellent, but also matched by an unnerving capacity for remaining still yet evoking a whole emotional world around her. But it is Andrew Scott who should take no notice of Charles Spencer’s lazy and borderline homophobic comments and rather focus on other reviews and the audience reaction to what is a brilliant performance as John’s boyfriend. Taking complete ownership of the words and inhabiting them so fully, this was a convincing a display of acting as you will ever see, all the more impressive given the how exposing the set-up is. Manipulative, lovestruck, bitingly funny, this is a highly complex character but one who we connected with straightaway, even if we questioned his treatment of his younger lover, but Scott kept him touchingly vulnerable. If I’m being honest, I found the arrival of a fourth character, the father of the boyfriend, somewhat intrusive and an unnecessary addition to this dysfunctional trifecta. Paul Jesson was good, and the dinner party scene was admittedly extremely funny, but dramatically I felt he served only as a distraction from the central relationships. And I did find it hard at times to credit the devotion displayed to John despite his overt selfishness, but on reflection I see now that this was part of Bartlett’s intention: to show that we are all only human when faced with loss and that idealised, romanticised perfect partnerships are but a fiction."
546,546,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2014,Ian,From Here To Eternity, Shaftesbury,"Suffering the fate of a fair few musicals that have taken up residence in the slightly-too-out-of-the-way Shaftesbury Theatre, From Here To Eternity announced its early closing last year and since then the end has drawn even closer with the final date being moved from the end of April to 29th March. I wasn’t blown away by it on first viewing but I had thought I might be tempted to see it again to see how it stood up to repeated viewing and also to get another listen to Stuart Brayson’s naggingly persistent score. But to be honest, it didn’t really work out that well.   A sadly small audience robbed the theatre of atmosphere despite the cast’s best efforts – it was however nice to see Marc Antolin doing well standing in for Ryan Sampson as Maggio – and there is no escaping the strange weighting of the show towards trying to make empathetic figures out of a largely objectionable group of people, especially in the racist, adulterous, misogynistic, homophobic bullying G Company. "
547,547,Ought To Be Clowns,09/05/2019,Ian,Death of a Salesman, Young Vic,"The American dream hasn’t often looked like this. Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell’s re-imagining of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman reaffirms the Young Vic as the place to go to shake up these American classics (qv A View from the Bridge) with a startling revival that seems destined to go far. Elliott has recent form of course in reinterpretations and Cromwell was the Associate Director on Company too. And if Death… might not go quite as far, it still emerges as a thoughtful reconsideration with a decidedly psychological bent, trapping us as much as Willy in his troubled mind.  Wendell Pierce (of The Wire, which I’ve still to watch) is pitch-perfect as Willy Loman, the travelling salesman burnt out by a life on the road chasing a satisfaction that never came. And by making the Lomans an African-American family, their tragedy is sharpened as we see the impact of 1940s societal racism in miniature.  And Sharon D Clarke as his wife Linda, and Arinzé Kene and Martins Imhangbe as their songs Biff and Happy all track the weight path of their own disappointments, as well as despairing of what is happening to their paterfamilias. Anna Fleischle’s sparse and smart design heightens the dreamlike, or nightmarish, quality of Willy’s retreats into his mind, aided by stunning lighting work from Aideen Malone."
548,548,Ought To Be Clowns,28/04/2012,Ian,The Conquest of the South Pole, Arcola,"When it comes to European drama, I’ve tried my best with the slim pickings available to us here in London and I have quite often been pleasantly surprised: I Am The Wind and Big and Small being the examples that pop into the mind, as theatre that just operates on a completely different level to what I’m used to and given a treatment that somehow connected with me. But there have been shows that failed to break through the enigma – Black Battles with Dogs being the most recent example – and I’m sad to say that Manfred Karge’s The Conquest of the South Pole fell firmly into this category, leaving me completely nonplussed as to what it is that it is trying to say or do. Stephen Unwin directed this show back in 1988 and for this, its first revival in London since then, he has returned to the piece for which he obviously has great affection to present in the main studio at the Arcola. But you know you’re in trouble when the most fascinating thing happening is three Hackney kids gate-crashing the theatre via an unlocked side-door and the subsequent silent efforts to get them to leave. Ultimately, I found this much more engrossing than the story of this group of unemployed young men who decide escape the grimness of their lives by re-enacting Amundsen’s voyage to the South Pole in a cramped attic using a washing line and some sheets to evoke the Antarctic tundra. So much of it I just found painful to watch: whether it was ‘falling to the knees’ acting, ‘jumping on the table’ acting or ‘pretending to be a dog’ acting; long recitals from books, bizarre singing interludes or the random force-feeding of meringues and new potatoes (separately) disrupting whatever flow there was; the cardboard pigeons or perhaps the single most pretentious, excruciatingly drawn out sequence I think I’ve ever seen in a theatre (at which my stifled giggles erupted into proper laughter out loud I’m sorry to say). I’m not particularly proud of this but the play had just stretched my tolerance levels way too far at this point. Despite the efforts of a talented cast who work in varying degrees of effectiveness – O-T Fagbenle copes manfully as the driving force behind the group’s escapist fantasies and Emma Cunniffe managed to find some real empathy beneath the banality of the much of her script – I never once felt any real connection with these characters or their plight. And as Unwin’s direction flits too often between the expressionistic and the literal, there’s no chance of us being swept away into the all-encompassing different mind-set that marks successful interpretations of this kind of drama. Instead we’re jerked in and out, up and down and all around the theatre in a merry dance (or slow conga-walk…) to the end of the earth and the end of my patience.     "
549,549,Ought To Be Clowns,01/02/2012,Ian,Our Country’s Good, Rose Kingston,"Timberlake Wertenbaker’s 1988 play Our Country’s Good achieved the status of a mnodern classic, making it into the NT’s list of the top 100 plays of the twentieth century. Which truth be told was the main reason that Mr @pcchan1981 and I made the journey over to the Rose Theatre in Kingston to go and see it. This production is by the Original Theatre Company with Anvil Arts and will be touring the country extensively over the coming months. The play is set in a newly colonised Australia in 1788, where a ship full of transported convicts accompanied by a troupe of soldiers are forced together in this foreign land to forge a new society. Based on a true story, it tells of a benevolent governor who looked beyond the contemporary standpoint on crime and punishment to a more modern view of rehabilitation and used the power of theatre to try and offer an alternative to the unruly mob, much to the displeasure of his officers. There’s no denying the awkward space of the Rose Kingston, a stage that is set far too far back which instantly distances an audience. And in some ways, director Alastair Whatley’s approach doesn’t always help. There’s a measured stateliness to proceedings that makes the first half in particular quite flat and dry, and even though the curtain-heavy set would seem ideal for rapid scene changes, there’s little sense of pace which sadly meant my attention wasn’t always grabbed as fully as it might have been. Combined with a lack of atmosphere, the venue working against them here but also the dearth of an effective soundscape deployed throughout that might have assisted – what singing there is works extremely well. That’s not to say that there isn’t anything to enjoy here, not at all. The ensemble of 10 revel in the opportunity to double up: Aden Gillett makes a compassionate Governor and a bookish Wisehammer, desperate to preserve the integrity of the text; Adam Best’s vicious Major Ross contrasts well with his kindly Ketch, and Philip Whitchurch provides a trio of well-defined characters. Chris Harper does an excellent job as the Second Lieutenant who steps up to be the director of the play and gently introduces his cast to the concept of acting, of dealing with their issues in another way and defending their rights against the hostility from his fellow brother officers. Wertenbaker really impresses though with her female characters, pointing up the cruel disparities in the treatment of female prisoners at the time, and the greater emotional release that acting provided for them. Emma Gregory’s Liz Morden embodies this best with a beautiful performance, with Emily Bowker’s tender Mary and Rachel Donovan’s bawdy Dabby also impressing. When this was performed at the Royal Court, it was performed in rep with George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer – the piece which the convicts are rehearsing throughout this play – something which was repeated with the radio productions which I listened to just before Christmas (brief reviews of Our Country’s Good and The Recruiting Officer linked up there). So there’s something quite neat about the fact that Josie Rourke’s inaugural Donmar production next month will be The Recruiting Officer, meaning I’ll have gotten to see each of these shows for the first time quite close together."
550,550,Ought To Be Clowns,23/09/2015,mag9l,The Win Bin, Old Red Lion,"As the National Youth Theatre’s annual West End rep season is about to start up again, it’s rather neat to see one of its key members from last year’s company writing and starring in her own show. Kate Kennedy took on the lead role in the much-maligned Selfie and since then has become the UK Monologue Slam Champion, been Offie-nominated for her acting and shortlisted for the Papatango Prize for The Win Bin, which has been playing at the Old Red Lion these past few weeks. Co-created with Sara Joyce who directs, The Win Bin is a free-wheeling fantasia which imagines the competitiveness of the arts job market projected into a dystopian near-future. And it’s not all that fantastical either, “the last paid job in the arts” being decided via a Hunger Games-meets-Big-Brother procedure with the final round being a 12 hour assessment day with six people having made it through, all realistically desperate in their own way.  Lest that all sound too serious though, the show is mostly structured as a rapid-fire sketch comedy with Kennedy and co-star Wilf Scolding each taking on three roles and ricocheting between them all in a series of vignettes. From eye-catchingly extreme behaviour to the grind of auditions, the reality of internships to the reality TV tropes aimed at garnering sympathy, it’s a neat encapsulation of how far some people will go when pushed to the limit."
551,551,Ought To Be Clowns,23/04/2012,Ian,Afternoon Dramas – Lilo and My One and Only,,"I first became aware of King with her darkly atmospheric play Foxfinder at the Finborough last year which I rather enjoyed, so was looking forward to My One and Only even before the announcement of the frankly fantabulous Katherine Parkinson as Layla, one of the lead roles in this tale about stalkerish obsessive love and the modern technological age facilitates that all too easily. A modern advancement of the epistolary form, this play is made up purely of phone calls yet King manages to build up character and mood in the most effective of manners as the tale twists and turns with jaw-dropping revelations and heart-stopping tension. Struggling after the end of a torrid affair, Layla goes on a date with the unassuming Noah but though she feels no chemistry between them, he feels differently and proves rather hard to shake off. His attentions grow ever more persistent and soon no aspect of her life seems safe from him, so-far so-usual stalker thriller, but King takes this way further by contrasting Noah’s behaviour with Layla’s own reluctance to give up her married lover Ben or stop trying to contact him. What follows is a twisted tale of deluded passion, sordid manipulations, horrific decision-making and moments of genuine fear which I would highly recommend downloading from the BBC podcast. Parkinson is excellent throughout as the lonely Layla, abrasive in her interactions with her friends who disapprove of her affair and seemingly uneasy in everyday contact with people. Carl Prekopp’s Noah makes a convincingly disturbed young man who will do anything for the woman with whom he is obsessed and Simon Bubb and Victoria Inez Hardy as the couple caught up in the twisted games also do well. A job very well done. By comparison, Katie Hims’ Lilo was a more gentle affair, a ruminative tale of what might have been as childhood sweethearts Simone and Trystan meet up after 18 years and start to probe the intimacies and dark secrets of their shared past. Hims weaves together stories of the pair at ages 11, 18 and 36 from their schooldays together, to the growing of an unfulfilled teenage love between them, to their completely separate adult lives as the full truth about what has guided their relationship slowly hoves into view.  "
552,552,Ought To Be Clowns,11/09/2009,Ian,The Shawl, Arcola,"The play is about a conman-like psychic John, played by Matthew Marsh, who is attempting to fleece Miss A out of a large inheritance, whilst teaching his young protégé Charles the tricks of his trade. Miss A has her own agenda in visiting the psychic though and Charles is less interested in real learning than just making a quick buck. Over four short acts, the issues of trust and betrayal in the shadow of greed are examined and the question is asked “is there such thing as an honest charlatan?” As the aforementioned Oscar nominee, Elizabeth McGovern is quietly assured as Miss A, giving a strong performance from the early desperation for answers, through the righteous anger at being deceived, to a closing air of beatific calm after the climactic reveal. Paul Rattray as Charles, the younger associate of John, is the weakest link here. Largely because he has little to do really, but I didn’t really feel his presence in the scenes he was in either. He didn’t really convince as the more greedy, duplicitous side of the partnership, and the chemistry between Charles and John never really took off (indeed I am not 100% sure that they were in a gay relationship although Wikipedia tells me otherwise). But this is Matthew Marsh’s play. He’s the one constant presence in all four scenes and is spell-bindingly captivating throughout, whether as the showman channelling an old spirit to commune with the dead, employing his intuitive trickery on his victim or contempuously exposing the tricks to Charles. Despite his chosen profession, John does have some integrity in his craft as he tries to pass this on to Charles, and Marsh skilfully plays up this humanity by showing that the greed which drives the younger man is not the only motivating factor for himself, rather he wants to be able to give people what they want."
553,553,Ought To Be Clowns,19/04/2014,mag9l,Home, National Theatre,"Returning to the Shed after a successful run last year, Nadia Fall’s Home is a compelling piece of verbatim theatre, stitched together by an exciting company – many of whom have returned from the original cast – who guide us through the changing, complex world of Target East, a refuge for young homeless people in London. The centre may be fictional but the issues and incidents raised here are anything but. The need for security, a place where they can feel protected, is common to all the residents here, some just passing through, others destined to stay a bit longer and the staff committed to their thankless tasks just as long as the funding holds out. Fall deliberately crashes narratives into each other, the chaos of life for many of these people reflected in the way their stories get told, echoes of similar experiences creeping through just as much as the stark differences. Toby Wharton’s uber-British Tattoo Boy rages with a fiercely incredible nationalistic anti-immigrant rant but he’s instantly juxtaposed with Antonia Thomas’ Eritrean refugee, horrifically sexually abused whilst trying to seek asylum here. And in the staff body, Ashley McGuire’s beautifully pragmatic hostel manager Sharon is contrasted with the smugness of Danny Sapani’s key worker, fully sure that his presence alone means he has a connection with his charges, unaware of just how disengaged he really is."
554,554,Ought To Be Clowns,22/05/2017,Ian,Assata Taught Me, Gate,"Frankie Bradshaw’s design for Assata Taught Me at the Gate Theatre is nothing short of wondrous, with its turquoise walls patched with corrugated iron, faded tiles on the floor. Along with Jack Weir’s lighting, all the colourful character of old Havana is evoked, along with the complex history right up to its contemporary situation. And it is in the modern day there that we find Assata Shakur, a woman who has the infamy of being the first woman to make the FBI’s Most Wanted list. Shakur (mother of Tupac FYI) really does live in political exile in Cuba but Kalungi Ssebandeke’s play is a work of fiction, imagining the relationship that develops between her and a young law student to whom she starts to teach English. Kenneth Omole’s Fanuco isn’t aware of who his teacher is, the backstory with which we’re briefly acquainted as the show opens but as their lessons progress, it is increasingly clear how diametrically opposed the pair are. Their battles cover a wide range of issues – their divergent positions within the spectrum of black struggle, Cuban realities versus American Dreams, the importance of history against the aspirations of the future. And if Ssebandeke’s format is a little schematic as it uses the weekly lessons to develop the pair and then makes Assatu use her grandmother’s photo as a conversational aid inbetween, Adjoa Andoh is never less than scintillating. "
555,555,Ought To Be Clowns,30/04/2017,Ian,The Cardinal, Southwark Playhouse,"It’s not too often that I open a review with mention of the sound design but Max Pappenheim’s work in The Little at the Southwark Playhouse is undoubtedly worthy of the accolade. In this intimate auditorium on the architecturally clean lines of Anna Reid’s set, there’s an extraordinary sense of being in vaulted palace chambers and cathedrals as echoes and reverberations amplify our imaginations perfectly. It’s the kind of creative invention that those familiar with director Justin Audibert have come to expect and it is thrilling to see it maintained whether working in the vast Royal Shakespeare Theatre where his recent Snow in Midsummer was excellent, or on this much smaller scale where it is a real delight to see someone really understanding how to play to all sides of a thrust stage. There’s also a fascinating choice of material here in this revival of James Shirley’s The Cardinal, a 1641 play whose claim to fame is being one of the last to be performed before Oliver Cromwell pulled the plug on show-business. 
Set in the unsettled kingdom of Navarre, The Cardinal emerges as a revenge tragedy and Audibert’s clear-sighted direction ensures that the intricacies of the plotting is lucid and consistently compelling. The Duchess Rosaura wants to marry the Count D’Alvarez but the Machiavellian Cardinal wants her for his nephew Columbo – their battle of wills sweeps up many in the court around them with spectacularly bloody results. Stephen Boxer’s carmine-robed Cardinal is charismatically malevolent as many a good villain and Natalie Simpson’s Duchess is a marvellously determined agent of chaos in her own way, each marshalling allies to their side to scheme, whether Phil Cheadle’s righteous Hernando or Timothy Speyer’s wily Antonio. And through courtly dances, smashing sword-fights (kudos to fight director Bret Yount), a multitude of letters and a fair few doses of poison, the consequences of steadfastly pursuing one’s own path – whether of ambition or vengeance – are vividly portrayed."
556,556,Ought To Be Clowns,13/10/2015,mag9l,In The Heights, King’s Cross Theatre,"Lin-Manuel Miranda’s stock could not be higher with his new show Hamilton taking Broadway by storm so it’s an apposite time for this belated transfer of his earlier musical In The Heights, with book written by Quiara Alegría Hudes. Undoubtedly one of the best shows of 2014, Luke Sheppard’s production blew the roof off the Southwark Playhouse and is now poised to do the same at the King’s Cross Theatre with many of the original cast and creatives returning to give us a slice of life from the New York Hispanic community of Washington Heights.  Nothing has been lost in the move, the whole production just sparks with vivid life. From takis’ effective sidewalk design (now with added movable fire escape) to the pure joy of Drew McOnie’s choreography, the reconfigured staging releases a newer, raw energy that blooms into the space. And with Gabriella Slade’s day-glo bright costumes, the vibrant splashes of Howard Hudson’s lighting and the crispness of Gareth Owen’s sound design, complemented well by Phil Cornwell’s musical direction, Sheppard keeps the show firing excitingly at full throttle throughout. And this sense of thrill carries through the cast, whose fierce commitment truly transports you into this world. Whether Josie Benson’s no-nonsense Camila laying into stubborn family members, Cleve September’s deeply compassionate but would-be street Sonny, the delightful daffiness of Sarah Naudi’s Carla or Victoria Hamilton-Barritt’s rip-roaring Daniela (the phrase ‘ay mami’ definitely comes to mind ;-)), these are supporting characters that live long in the mind, resonating with real conviction and effectively peopling the neighbourhood.  So it is easy to see why there’s such a strong sense of push and pull from the leads, dealing with the simultaneous claustrophobia and comfort of a place where everyone knows your name and the complexity of deciding where home is for first- and second-generation immigrants. Sam Mackay’s superb Usnavi and Lily Frazer’s measured Nina exemplify this conflict perfectly, with Jade Ewen and US actor Joe Aaron Reid as their respective love interests also impressing. Mackay’s lyrical dexterity really is a thing to behold though."

558,558,Ought To Be Clowns,14/06/2010,Ian,A Celebration of Kate McGarrigle, Royal Festival Hall," A Celebration of Kate McGarrigle was a show of profound beauty and amazing music put together as part of the Southbank’s Meltdown Festival, curated this year by Richard Thompson, to commemorate the life of Kate who died of cancer earlier this year. She was part of a huge musical dynasty in her native Canada, part of the folk scene with her sister Anna, ex-wife of Loudon Wainwright III, but latterly probably more famous as the mother of Rufus and Martha Wainwright. Over three hours, a huge number of people came together to remember a beloved mother, sister, aunt, colleague by teaming up and performing numbers from Kate & Anna’s back catalogue, ably supported by a hugely talented band. People like Nick Cave, Neil Tennant, Emmylou Harris, Teddy Thompson, Lisa Hannigan, Michael Ondaatje all gave their own unique contributions, paying tribute in their own special ways with her family members also chipping in, sister Jane on the piano, niece and nephew doing backing vocals on a huge number of songs and of course Rufus and Martha at the heart of everything. The first half had more of a jamming feel about it, Martha and Rufus joined up on ‘Kiss and Say Good bye’, Richard Thompson rattled through ‘Swimming Song’, various groups gave some lovely close harmonies on a couple of old Québécois folk songs and there was a real feel of celebration, the continuation of an amazing legacy of collaborative music-making. There was some of the usual shambolic antics that characterises much of the group McGarrigle/Wainwright occasions, a few restarts, a few missed cues and this kept the atmosphere nicely light. The second half started with a more reflective tone however, a home video of Kate miming along to one of her songs on the radio was a delightfully daft touch, but as we watched her sister, niece and daughter watching it, it also served to remind what a vivacious personality has been lost. This more sombre mood did give rise to some of the more emotional moments of the show. My personal favourite McGarrigle song, ‘I Eat Dinner (When The Hunger Stops)’ was as amazing as I’d ever hoped it could be with Rufus duetting with Emmylou Harris to just stunning effect. This was then followed by an emotionally devastating rendition of ‘Proserpina’, the last song Kate ever wrote, Martha took lead vocals with most everyone else providing backing . With its repeated lyric of ‘Come home to Mama’, it was almost too much to bear and as she began to crumble, the tears began to fall in earnest, on my cheeks, those around me, those on stage, it was a beautiful, heart-breaking, touching moment. Emmylou and Anna harmonising on ‘Talk To Me Of Mendocino’, Michael Ondaatje giving a recital of a section of one of his books inspired by the sisters, moments of heartbreaking beauty flew by but it was uplifting too. And as if we weren’t feeling emotionally bruised enough by the end, Rufus finished off with a beautiful piano version of ‘Walking Son’g , breaking down at the end and whispering ‘thanks Mom’ before the ensemble came onstage to take their bows to the most deserving standing ovation I think I’ve given and a chirpy encore of ‘Love Over and Over’. The evening went a long way to show just how strong a songwriter Kate was and how loved a person she was. The intimacy of her work, the domestic settings, the familiar feelings, combined with a lyrical incisiveness and absolute honesty meaning the sheer simplicity and strength shone through with a bright light through the varied interpretations and demonstrated what a huge contribution she made to the folk music tradition. The grace under pressure shown by sister Anna, an integral part of so many of the numbers and the courage shown by the other participants, especially her family members, in sharing this moment with us is something I will be forever grateful for and I hope they found some kind of catharsis in the experience. The mere fact that such huge talent came together to celebrate her life and to create enjoyment for others in a time of such personal grief is testament to the power of her own legacy (as is the fund set up in her name) and wherever she is, I rather suspect she would have gained much pleasure in watching her loved ones in this show. Postscript: I didn’t take notes but I wish I had now to have a perfect record of what was a stunning evening. In some ways I wish it had been recorded for posterity but in others one can never really capture the special energy and emotion of one off events like these so perhaps it is best for it to remain a beautiful memory. Still I thought I’d try and recall as much as I could for myself. Martha premiered ‘I Am A Diamond’ (written as part of a musical but I couldn’t catch what it was about), never heard before and I can see it fitting right into Martha’s canon, it was just lovely; Lisa Hannigan made a mockery of the fact that she is not more famous with some incredible lead vocal s on a couple of songs, one of which left Rufus green with envy as he told us whilst introducing her, ‘Entre La Jeunesse’ I think it was, she really deserves to be huge; Krystle Warren added her bluesy tones, singing ‘Come A Long Way’ with Rufus and another solo song; Jenni Muldaur’s renditions of ‘Lying Song’ and ‘Tell My Sister’ were lovey but her duet with Nick Cave, ‘Blues In D’, was excellent; Nick Cave also popped up with one of his own songs from the album No More Shall We Part on which the McGarrigles provided backing vocals; The Thompson family gave a rousing rendition of ‘As Fast My Little Feet’ which lightened the mood somewhat after a particularly emotional segment, the stark ‘Go Leave’ sung by Linda Thompson with Richard on guitar was lovely but Teddy Thompson’s stripped back ‘Saratoga Summer’ was a thing of absolute beauty; Surprise guest Neil Tennant emerged in the second half to give a lovely rendition of ‘I Cried For Us’ which amazingly as it was still played by the band, managed to sound just like a Pet Shop Boys song; oh and Chaim Tennenbaum sang a song about Jesus. There was a song written by Jane McGarrigle which was lovely but I can’t remember anything about and the gorgeous song towards the end that was written by someone else but had a lyric along the lines of “If I had wings like a dove, I’d fly to the ones I love”, let me know if you know what is was.       What a nice review of what sounds like an amazing evening. I would have liked it to have been recorded as I live in Canada so couldn't make it,  Kate will be sorely missed but her music and legacy lives on. RIP. I couldn't agree with you more; it was an experience I will never forget. Even my 12-year-old was sobbing! It was a one-off, and we were so very lucky to be able to be there. I can't imagine how they all got through it, but I am so grateful that we were allowed to share an incredible three hours with them. Farewell, dear Kate. Lovely review. I imagine the song you mention at the end would have been ""Fare Thee Well"" (aka ""Dink's Song"").

560,560,Ought To Be Clowns,25/03/2018,Ian,Three Sisters, Brockley Jack,"Now in their fifth year, Arrows and Traps have been building quite the reputation as a shining example of how to do fringe theatre. Cultivating relationships with theatres (they’re once more at the Brockley Jack) and creatives (beyond notions of repertory, it is pleasing to see familiar names pop up in production after production and not just as actors) and above all, producing theatre that people want to see.  And Chekhov’s Three Sisters, presented here in a new version by Ross McGregor, continues that strong tradition, paring back the starch to locate a real emotional directness to the trials of the Prozorov sisters. Trapped in the cultural desert of the provinces, far from the beloved Moscow of their childhood, the rise and fall of their hopes and dreams are traced over four crucial years.  There’s beautifully detailed work from Cornelia Baumann’s painfully self-critical Olga, unable to stop watching the years pass in the mirror, Victoria Llewellyn’s bright-eyed Irina, slowly resigning herself to the realities of the world and Claire Bowman’s astonishing read of Masha, whose feelings seem to be dialled up to their absolute maximum, almost too much to bear with.   With this much spirit, and a household that is full of music and life (beautifully designed by Odin Corie, music by Takesh! Furukawa), there’s a fresh take on the emotional stasis at the heart of the play. The oft-repeated desire to return to Moscow is as much about the grass is greener…  than a definitive imperative. With handsome soldiers paying them attention (strong work from both Toby Wynn-Davies’ Vershinin and Conor Moss’ Baron), life isn’t so bad.  Their tragedy comes in the way that they let that life pass by them, characterised by the growth in stature of Hannah Victory’s well-judged Natasha. From the easily mocked girlfriend of their brother to his wife and then head of the household, she gains all that she wants and more, a perfectly cruel and ever-present reminder to all of the Prozorovs of the perils of inaction. The only real criticism (of sorts) I can muster comes from the level of expectation that Arrows and Traps now bring to the table for me. From the swirling romanticism of Anna Karenina to the cross-cutting narratives of Frankenstein, their adaptations have been thrillingly inventive and it is only on this level that Three Sisters doesn’t quite stand out as much as their best work, Chekhov presumably being as stubbornly resistant to as much substantive change as so many of his characters. That aside, this is an accessible and enjoyable take on Chekhov which shouldn’t be missed. "
561,561,Ought To Be Clowns,18/02/2019,Ian,Call Me Fury, VAULT Festival,"Fresh from their Offie-award winning success and more significantly, being named in my top 10 shows of last year, Out of the Forest Theatre return swiftly with their new play Call Me Fury, presented here as a work-in-progress by writer Sasha Wilson. And once again, she urges us to reconsider what we think of as history, whilst constructing a new narrative that seeks to redress some of that patriarchal imbalance. This time it is the Salem Witch Trials that are the primary target, though Wilson’s forensic eye layers in so much more besides. Notions of women not being believed in courtrooms, men abusing positions of power, lies gaining a terrible currency through all levels of society – there’s a terrible timelessness to so much of the way that women have been and still are treated, history needs to teach us better but it has to be the right history. And this resetting of history is achieved through a characterful mixture of  creative storytelling and live folk music, bringing together Americana old and tune, Johnny Cash to Colter Wall. As any number and gender of character, the company of four – Andrea Black, Mairi Hawthorn, Silvana Maimone and Wilson – are spine-chillingly effective throughout, particularly on the final haunting strains of ‘I Am Stretched On Your Grave’. My only note lies around a thought that there’s a less effective incorporation of music into the storytelling in the first part of the show. It’s only as we move to more climactic, traumatic events that Wilson seems to be comfortable letting music be the primary atmospheric driver and in some ways, you can understand why."
562,562,Ought To Be Clowns,28/09/2017,Ian,Frankenstein, Brockley Jack,"You may think you know the story of Frankenstein – in the 200 years since Mary Shelley wrote the novel for which she is most famed, it has received countless adaptations and sunk deep into the collective consciousness. But chances are that Arrows & Traps’ version will disarm you and make you consider it anew as it introduces a new, crucial character into the narrative – Mary Shelley herself. Writer/director Ross McGregor’s reinterpretation of this tale is masterfully done. Framed as something of a fever dream, a hallucination by the older Shelley who suffered from a brain tumour for more than a decade before her death, the story here is split in three. We follow the story of the Creature and, separately, of Victor Frankenstein; but we also explore Shelley’s life too, the experiences that led up to her creation of such an epic piece of literature while still a teenager, the curious darkness that stalked her thereafter.  It’s a fascinating way of revisiting familiar material, one which examines the influences as much as the end product, revealing just how much of her self Shelley poured into the novel. The strongest element is her difficult relationship to the maternal bond, both in her own mother dying after giving birth to her and the deaths of several of her own children whilst very young, vividly refracted through both the Creature’s ‘adolescence’ and Victor’s familial situation, plus the effect on her own connection to her father. And reflecting this treatment, McGregor stages his play boldly too. Several of the company play multiple roles, switching from timeframe with the doffing of a hat and though it may take a minute to remember who exactly is who, this plays beautifully into the haziness of the older Shelley’s recollections. Timelines bleed into one another, dead bodies rise from the floor to suddenly become someone else, we find ourselves in a marvelously disconcerting dream-like state, realised perfectly by Ben Jacobs’ atmospheric shafts of lighting. "
563,563,Ought To Be Clowns,12/06/2012,Ian,The Physicists, Donmar Warehouse,"Forming the final entry in her debut season as Donmar AD, The Physicists continues Josie Rourke’s realignment of the Donmar’s artistic policy. And as with Making Noise Quietly, it is into previously unknown areas for me as this play was written in 1962 by Swiss playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt (although Rourke commissioned a new version here from Jack Thorne), someone I’ve never previously heard of. Wikipedia informs me he was a proponent of epic theatre but what it translates to here is a tragi-comedy with a farcical first half, which darkens to a more serious second which reflects its Cold War origins. It starts off like the punchline to a joke: three nuclear physicists are in a mental asylum. Herbert Georg Beutler, who believes he is Sir Isaac Newton, Ernst Heinrich Ernesti who is convinced he is Albert Einstein and Johann Wilhelm Möbius who has regular visitations from King Solomon. It emerges that the first two have murdered their nurses and that Möbius seems set to follow suit, but as the reasons for their actions slowly become apparent, it is clear that something greater is at stake here. Rourke marshals her cast well: John Heffernan continues his rise to becoming one of our finest leading men with a fine performance as the genuinely troubled Möbius, Sophie Thompson is barely recognisable as the hunchbacked psychiatrist Mathilde von Zahnd (surely some relation to Agatha Trunchbull…!) whose machinations keep the asylum running, and John Ramm and Miranda Raison each do well in supporting roles though it is a shame Raison doesn’t have more to do as she is fantastic. As the other two madmen, Justin Salinger and Paul Bhattacharjee have less impact, but as the tale unfolds it soon becomes clear why. It then therefore becomes a shame that the shift in the play comes so late with the discovery of what is really happening as the debate turns to matters of the responsibility that accompanies significant scientific revelation. This crucial moment is long-delayed and so when it comes, its intellectual impact is muted by the lack of room to expound fully, dramatically it forces a change of mood that Rourke cannot quite balance, and ultimately there’s no disguising the fact that its central issue about the nuclear threat is one which just does not carry the same impact as it would have done whilst the Cold War still raged.  "
564,564,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2015,Ian,Joan of Arc, New Diorama,"In amongst everything else that the Faction do, they’re also steadily working their way through Friedrich Schiller’s plays with the aim of staging the complete canon of his work. I’ve seen them take on Mary Stuart, Fiesco and The Robbers in recent years but their 2015 rep season features Joan of Arc, a free adaptation of The Maid of Orleans which was one of his most frequently performed plays during his lifetime. Its fiercely militaristic tone speaks to its popularity back then but the Faction, playing very much to their strengths in this thrilling and thoughtful version, make a sterling case for its pertinence today. The play tells its own variation on Joan’s life – one could hardly argue it is historically inaccurate – which repositions La Pucelle as a defiantly active warrior in the Dauphin’s forces as the French Crown struggles against the combined forces of the Duke of Burgundy and Henry VI of England. That she was a peasant girl who received religious visions only added to her allure when her talismanic presence proved decisive in turning the military tide but the natural suspicion of anything different, combined with Joan’s internal dilemmas about the validity of her spirituality, allows the seeds to be sown for her downfall (even if it plays out in an unexpected manner). Co-directed by Mark Leipacher and Rachel Valentine Smith, Joan of Arc feels like the most ‘Faction’-like of the three productions this year and it is all the better for it. Though still containing a leading role, the work of the ensemble feels threaded through the very skin of the production in a much more essential way than Ripley demonstrated and thus it pulses much more interestingly and excitingly. Natasha Rickman does devilish double duty as both the Dauphin and his haughty mother Queen Isabel, Christopher Tester finds fervent ferocity in characters as diverse as Joan’s father and an English lord, Tom Brownlee also stands out in his roles."
565,565,Ought To Be Clowns,20/12/2014,Ian,Made in Dagenham, Adelphi,"A third visit back to this most heart-warmingly lovely of shows and a fine festive occasion it turned out to be. Review #1 and review #2 can be read here and there’s little much to add that hasn’t already been said. There’s much about Made in Dagenham that is indubitably charming and the breadth of David Arnold’s score has a lovely distinct tunefulness that has really worked its way into my memory (meaning I’m the one humming along!). Additionally the leading performances of Gemma Arterton and particularly Adrian der Gregorian have really blossomed into something quite touching – I’d always been impressed by Arterton’s Rita but der Gregorian seems to have found a new emotional level as her husband Eddie. It’s also interesting to see where the nips and tucks have come in the show – the quip about Sandra’s dad liking whiskey and Monty’s redemption are two I noticed, and Rita’s daughter’s bolstering presence during ‘We Nearly Had It All’ is also now sadly gone. So it is a bit of a shame that the audience at this Saturday matinée was a little bit sparse. I hope it is just indicative of alternative priorities on the last Saturday before Christmas, for it would be a real ignominy for Made in Dagenham to be struggling when it is a prime example of a great British new musical. Yes it has its daft moments – Mark Hadfield’s idiosyncratic interpretation of Harold Wilson, the randomness of certain lyrical moments, the Last Supper tableau (which I personally really like) – but it has also has tons of heart, as Rupert Goold balances theatricality with truthfulness."
566,566,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2014,mag9l,Avenue Q, Greenwich Theatre,"Since co-writing Avenue Q in 2002 with Jeff Marx and book-writer Jeff Whitty, Robert Lopez’s career has sky-rocketed with the mega-musical The Book of Mormon and Disney behemoth Frozen so the opportunity to revisit life with the puppets in the less salubrious parts of New York is a welcome one. Sell A Door’s production opens at the Greenwich Theatre and then will go an extensive tour of the UK, visiting 19 more theatres across the country to spread its often outrageous but always warm-hearted tales of the trials of day-to-day living in the big city. So we follow fresh young graduate Princeton as his idealism gets slowly crushed by temp jobs and mounting bills and relief can only be found in booze and casual sex. Told in the style of an adult version of Sesame Street, the show is blessed with a brilliant witty score from Lopez and Marx which keeps a welcome edge to the show’s gooey heart and songs like ‘The Internet is for Porn’, ‘Everyone’s A Little Bit Racist’ and ‘If You Were Gay’ are instantly memorable classics which sit easily next to the bittersweet emotion of ‘It’s A Fine Fine Line’ and ‘Fantasies Come True’.  A more unforgiving eye might spot that there’s still some work to be done on fully mastering the puppets but given that the many of the cast are required to be quadruple threats, the level of singing, acting and dancing alongside the puppeteering is at times phenomenal, especially once they start doubling up on characters. Lucie-Mae Sumner shines brightly in playing the sweetness of Kate Monster and the sultriness of Lucy the Slut – in the same scene on more than one occasion – really capturing the wryness of Kate’s straightforward nature. Tom Steedon nails the all-American charm of leading man (or is he a muppet) Princeton as he bluffs his way through young adulthood and is particularly good fun as the highly-strung, closeted Rod. And Stephen Arden is on triple-duty as the filthy gruff-voiced Trekkie Monster, a devilish Bad Idea Bear and the hapless Nicky. Of the ‘straight’ actors, Richard Morse brings a lovely warm comic generosity to the overgrown kid that is Brian and Ellena Vincent’s Gary Coleman is a wonderfully supremely confident presence."
567,567,Ought To Be Clowns,04/04/2016,mag9l,Sunset Boulevard, London Coliseum,"Dammit – one of the key rationales behind my Broadway blowout last winter was seeing actors I didn’t think I’d otherwise have the chance to see in the West End, Glenn Close being chief among them and thus I forked out a pretty penny to see her in Edward Albee’s A Delicate Balance. So naturally her return to these shores was announced a few months later with a reprisal of her Tony Award-winning performance as Norma Desmond in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Sunset Boulevard. And as with last year’s Sweeney Todd here at the Coliseum too, director Lonny Price and the ENO have returned to the semi-staged format which allows them to mount a bare-bones production and still charge full whack for tickets, prices thus go up to £150. I understand that money has to be made, especially for an organisation in as perilous a position as theirs and they say at least 400 tickets at every performance is available at £25 or under (altitude training not provided though…)
Gripes aside, is it the “theatrical event of the year” that the advertising campaign has rather rashly claimed? Well yes and no. It certainly has the sense of being a major event, the roar from the audience as Close took to the stage for the first time was like nothing I’ve heard in a theatre before, even if the staircase from which she descends ain’t all that. And she seizes the role with all the aplomb of an actor in full command of every inch of her talent and deploying it to utterly devastating effect. Michael Xavier pairs up well with her as Joe Gillis, the young(ish) screenwriter who Desmond decides will be the ideal springboard from which to relaunch her faded movie career – his eye-popping attire for the title track will certainly be mentioned again later in the year (prays for production shots ;-)) – but not having seen the show before, I found myself a little unsure as to the true motivations of the character, not for Xavier’s lack of trying but a weakness in the writing (Don Black and Christopher Hampton) and possibly direction. He does sound like a dream though, as does Siobhan Dillon as his love interest Betty, and their ‘Too Much In Love To Care’ is just lovely, especially given what’s to come. The chorus of familiar West End faces do a good job, conductor Michael Reed keeps the lush orchestrations on the right side of lavish (no mean feat with a classy 51 piece orchestra) and elements of James Noone’s design really work well (ie the car) where as others don’t (ie the floating man)."
568,568,Ought To Be Clowns,28/12/2017,Ian,Elf, Lowry,"First things first, it’s a really poor show on behalf of those in charge of this production at the Lowry that there was no announcement or any mention of the fact that the understudy for the main part was on. Not for any sniffy reason about wanting to see Ben Forster but rather that it denied Colin Burnicle his spot in the limelight on the first occasion that he got to play the role of Buddy the Elf. I don’t think Burnicle will mind me saying he had an understandably slightly nervy beginning but he soon settled into the green felt boots of Buddy, working a slightly more frantic Jim Carrey-esque vibe than one might expect from a role originated on screen by Will Ferrell but it was one that worked. And he connected well with former Atomic Kitten Liz McLarnon as his putative love interest Juvie, as under-developed a part it is. Elf premiered in the UK a couple of years ago and when it made it to the West End’s Dominion, I saw it (review here) and I have to say that its rather old-school charms won me over. So I was happy to revisit it en famille this winter with three-quarters of its leading cast still intact – Forster joined by Joe McGann as Walter and Jessica Martin as Emily once again – and the latter two clearly having a ball once again."
569,569,Ought To Be Clowns,03/04/2016,mag9l,The Delights of Dogs and the Problems of People, Courtyard Studio,"It’s Robin and James’ 5th wedding anniversary so he’s filled her car with presents and sneaked into the kitchen to cook her a slap-up dinner. But he’s been “away” for a while and it’s safe to say she’s not expecting it, the contours of their relationship slowly becoming evident as pieces of the jigsaw are retrospectively added. As it suggests in its title, Rosalind Blessed’s The Delights of Dogs and the Problems of People thus contrasts the complexity of entangling oneself with another human compared to the simplicity of connecting with canine friends. There’s a boldness to elements of Blessed’s writing that makes it a striking presence in the intimacy of the Courtyard’s studio. The fourth wall is dismantled from the beginning as Duncan Wilkins’ James and then Blessed’s Robin chat to the audience directly, taking the he-said-she-said model to the next level with these extended POVs, allowing us real insight into where each character is coming from, their stories overflowing with nuanced detail about the essentially flawed nature of human existence. >But inbetween these uncompromising sections (and if you’re on the front row, be prepared to be wrapped up in the action – yours truly ended up becoming a pivotal character called Brandon!), are numerous flashbacks, examining happier times in the shattered pieces of their marriage – mainly involving adventures with their rescue dog. These lack the same pointed adventurousness and intensity, leaving a rather unbalanced feel to the show which is exacerbated by an interval that doesn’t feel altogether necessary."
570,570,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Little Shop of Horrors, Open Air Theatre,"It’s something of a relief when you’ve seen a version of a much-loved show that is nigh-on perfect, it really does take the pressure off those that follow. So I was able to visit a verdant Open Air Theatre to see Little Shop of Horrors – one of my all-time favourites, if not the actual one – excited by the prospect of what Maria Aberg had done, and secure in the knowledge that Derek Bond absolutely nailed it for the Royal Exchange a couple of years ago.  Chief among her innovations is giving Audrey II much more life than they’ve ever had before, by casting drag queen Vicky Vox in the role. So from twitching, voracious puppet plant (designed by Max Humphries with Tom Scutt) emerges a strutting shrub of sinful sass and it is an inspired choice. Making her a Mephistophelean figure who can prowl around the amphitheatre flips Audrey II into something as thrilling as threatening, Vox revelling in the lasciviousness of “feed me” and the most scathing raised eyebrow you ever did see.  And there’s much else to enjoy here too. Renée Lamb, Christina Modestou and Seyi Omooba are a strikingly contemporary Greek chorus (delivering Lizzi Gee’s choreography so well); Matt Willis is having an outrageously good time as the hopped-up sadistic dentist; and Tom Deering’s musical direction finds gorgeously interesting new textures in Alan Menken’s score, the interplay of dynamics as ‘Skid Row’ reaches its climax being a thing of extreme beauty. Against all this sterling work, the take on Seymour and Audrey seems a little traditional. Jemima Rooper is delightful as a sweet and pure Audrey and if Marc Antolin channelled perhaps just a little too much of his inner Rick Moranis, I thought Billy Cullum nailed his portrayal of the role (I saw the show twice). Keeping them as cartoonish as this though means that we don’t quite delve into the emotionally rich territory of her abuse and his dubious decision-making."
571,571,Ought To Be Clowns,14/05/2010,Ian,Peter Pan, Barbican,"There’s something about revisiting childhood favourites as an adult, a huge pleasure in discovering the deeper levels and meanings that escaped one’s more youthful self: I remember vividly discovering just how dark and vicious Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka gets with the truly revolting children in his factory after years of revelling in all the sweets, the excitement of the golden tickets and the Oompah Loompahs. Similarly here, my memories of Peter Pan were limited to the Disney film and the remake Hook, so in a nutshell, lots of fun as a Lost Boy and Julia Roberts being brought back to life. What I was not prepared for was the discovery of a huge well of aching sadness at the heart of this play. This partly due to the new version created by David Greig for the National Theatre of Scotland, of J.M. Barrie’s classic, which relocates the action to Victorian Edinburgh and in particular the time of the construction of the Forth Rail Bridge, the instant parallels being drawn between the Lost Boys or Neverland and the gangs of young boys used to pass the molten hot rivets to the ironworkers on the bridge. There’s little fun to be had here, but there’s also less fun to be had in Neverland which is reconceived as a darker, more anarchic and dangerous place, populated by boys in need of motherly love, a hunger which drives this whole play and it is one which affected me greatly, as my companion for the evening will attest, tears rolled down my cheeks solidly for the last 30 minutes! It is tremendously staged: Peter first appears walking down the side of the proscenium from the top, Tinkerbell is a fabulously well realised dancing fireball and the flying, by many members of the cast is well-executed. Crucially though, it is only used as an extra rather than the main attraction, the actors continue to act well whilst airborne which gives it an organic feel, there’s no awkwardness in the transitions. The bridge is represented by three large diamond shaped segments of the ironwork, which revolve and transform neatly into the rugged landscape of Neverland. Both Kevin Guthrie as Peter Pan and Kirsty Mackay as Wendy are still in training which one would never guess from their performances here. Guthrie captures the two sides of Pan well, the energetic and playful boyishness that still wants to hear the end of the Cinderella story against the enforced emotional coldness and at times wilfully malicious streak. Mackay plays a more strident Wendy, a girl who quickly realises the need to fulfil the void in the lives of the Lost Boys and matures appreciably in front of our eyes. She also has to come to terms with the realisation of her sexual attraction to Peter (perfectly understandable given Guthrie’s nicely toned and always exposed physique!) which lends a more adult edge to some of their scenes. Cal MacAninch’s muscular, modishly tattooed and kilted Hook is a bare-chested delight, genuinely menacing but the rest of the cast tend to blur a bit, with not much time really being devoted to establishing individual supporting characters, Smee really suffers in this respect but Own Whitelaw’s Slightly caught my eye with a well-nuanced performance that really tugs at the heartstrings, especially when we discover the provenance of his name. Clues are given to us to suggest that Neverland is actually somewhere in the Kingdom of FIfe and the production is thus suffused with a beautiful Celtic musical heritage. Taking sea shanties and working songs and weaving them with Gaelic folk songs, many of which were sung and played by Alasdair Macrae on the fiddle and Annie Grace on a mightily impressive array of instruments including different types of pipes; a quartet of female voices led by Grace singing John Anderson, My Jo was a personal highlight. So much of this production was deeply moving to me: mothers singing laments at ever-open windows, the unbridled joy of boys finally having stories told to them, Pan’s emotional detachment, even Hook’s existential angst and of course the devastating coda set in Wendy’s future. My rediscovery of this Peter Pan as a darker and more melancholic story than I ever remembered leads me to think that this is not perhaps the family show people may think it to be, it is more suited for teenagers upwards I would say, but there is much, much to enjoy here. A highly recommended production and it will be newly illuminating to you no matter how recently you’ve seen or read it, just make sure you’ve got a couple of tissues in case it packs the same emotional wallop that it did for me."
572,572,Ought To Be Clowns,04/04/2018,Ian,The Garden, Tristan Bates,"Written by and starring alumni from The Play That Goes Wrong (which I have still yet to get around to going to see), new play The Garden is undergoing a short run at the Tristan Bates in association with Carers Trust. Fundraising efforts have allowed for tonight’s performance to be offered as a welcome respite for carers, to provide a bit of a treat for them. And it is a fascinating play that they’re getting to see. Set up as a Beckettian take on the Garden of Eden, it is far more deftly comic than that would seemingly allow for. When you’ve got Colin and Veronica instead of Adam and Eve, how could it not be?! Crucially though, The Garden is also rather touching in its gentle drama, leaving me more moved than I’ve ever been in an actual Beckett play. This version of Eden is an onion field, ruled over by an unseen ‘Her’, and the illicit fruit just out of touch is a tomato. Which is a fruit, not a vegetable… And here, writers Phil Spencer and Fred Gray have real fun deconstructing notions of gender, of sex, of language itself as Colin (Tom Babbage) and Veronica (Jamie Birkett) deal with the numbing reality of being stuck together, forever. The storytelling proves as vivid as the writing (I’ll never think of ‘keeping your eyes peeled’ the same way again) as the pair work out a kind of sibling dynamic, something a little problematic when they’re meant to be populating the world. And Birkett and Babbage develop a beautiful relationship from the tenderness of real affection to the ecstasy of the best games of tag."
573,573,Ought To Be Clowns,31/05/2015,mag9l,Kafka on the Shore, Barbican,"Tumbling dreamily into the world of Japanese magic realism, Yukio Ninagawa’s spectacular production of Haruki Murakami’s novel Kafka on the Shore makes a sadly too-short stop at the Barbican, which is a real shame at it is one of the more visually striking plays of the year. Tsukasa Nakagoshi’s design of transparent boxes is the ideal vehicle for the swirling twin narratives of the story, in all their freeform strangeness as talking cats, murdered sculptors, Johnnie Walker himself, former pop stars, women’s toilet campaigners and much more beside come into play in Frank Galati’s adaptation. On the one hand there’s 15 year old Kafka Tamura who runs away from his overbearing father and their Tokyo home with his imaginary friend Crow, ever dreaming of the mother who abandoned him as a young boy. And on the other there’s Satoru Nakata, an elderly gentleman who was afflicted by a childhood incident which severely stunted his development but left him able to communicate with cats. Stretching across Japan and delving effortlessly in and out of both fantastical realms and real life, their dream-like journeys slowly coalesce into one bewitching reverie. Manipulated by a team of seemingly tireless stagehands (deservedly getting their own curtain call), the swirl of the perspex containers is an audacious feat but an expertly calibrated one too, Ninagawa and Nakagoshi condensing locations into elemental simplicity but also retaining more unusual aspects such as the singer encased like a museum artefact or a little person wordlessly riding a tricycle. The stagecraft is endlessly inventive but it does have a tendency to merge into an indistinct whole, longueurs creating lulls in which one’s own dreams might come a-calling.  The strength of the acting ensures we’re never marooned aimlessly in this world though. Nino Furuhata’s Kafka and Katsumi Kiba’s Nakata invest real pathos into their performances so that the dilemmas that they face are felt keenly, aided beautifully by Naohito Fujiki’s Oshima and Tsutomu Takahashi’s Hoshino respectively, as two very different buddy stories emerge. Rie Miyazawa’s work as the inscrutable Miss Saeki is just gorgeous and mention should also be made of Mutsukiko Doi, Mame Yamada and Yukio Tsukamoto as a trio of strangely compelling cats. "
574,574,Ought To Be Clowns,20/10/2016,mag9l,The Grinning Man, Bristol Old Vic,"All the best birthday celebrations go on for a while and Bristol Old Vic’s 250th Anniversary programme has been no exception, featuring productions from each of the four centuries of the theatre’s life. I took in the Lesley Manville opus Long Day’s Journey Into Night earlier in the year and returned to the South West with great anticipation for the 21st century strand of work, which is the macabre, and excellent, new musical The Grinning Man.  Based on the Victor Hugo novel L’Homme Qui Rit (The Man Who Laughs), the show tells the dark tale of Grinpayne, a young man mutilated as a child who scrapes a living as part of a carnival troupe with his adopted family. Grinpayne keeps the lower part of his face covered but the highlight of the fair comes when he reveals his scarred ‘smile’, a sight that moves people in unpredictable ways, not least the royal family in whose intrigues Grinpayne finds himself increasingly embroiled. Written by Carl Grose and directed by BOV AD Tom Morris, The Grinning Man is a deliciously dark fairytale of a show, sharing DNA with the likes of Kneehigh and The Light Princess in its theatrical playfulness and musical complexity. Tim Phillips and Marc Teitler’s score is at times extraordinary, in its range of instrumentation, in its bold emotional palette, and this reflects the epic nature of the story as the search for love, truth (and honesty – who can resist a Bananarama reference…) reaches to the highest point in the kingdom.  And though it is perhaps a tad too epic in length, it is hugely exciting and engrossing – a startling take on a chamber musical that is perfectly suited to the intimacy of this gorgeous theatre. (People will clamour for a London transfer but I can’t think of a theatre in which it would fit so well, book for Bristol now instead!) Jon Bausor’s design is beautifully done in all its imaginative simplicity, aided by the Gothic darkness of Richard Howell’s lighting design, and the puppetry from Gyre and Gimble is really very well done Yes, that’s me praising puppetry – a rare thing indeed. But I have to say that the ‘Beauty and the Beast/Kiss of Life’ sequence in which Grinpayne and Dea, the blind girl he has been raised with, first acted out a love story with puppets and then found themselves reprising it IRL was one of the most magically, beautiful things I’ve seen and heard this year – utterly gorgeous and romantic and yet with that slight bittersweet tang of knowing how fucked up their world is. For the tangled web of the truth is a brutal one, meaning its 12+ age rating is certainly earned. The show has been superbly cast too. Louis Maskell is exceptional as the fiendishly complex and damaged Grinpayne, unprepared for the massive changes that happen in his life, whether clinging onto the purity of Dea’s love (an achingly good Audrey Brisson) or surrendering to the seductive glamour of Gloria Onitiri’s randy Duchess Josiana. There’s great work too from Stuart Neal’s disgraced royal Lord David Dirry-Moir, Patrycja Kujawska’s imperious Queen Angelica and the marvellous Julian Bleach as the malevolent Barkilphedro, whose ambitions hide deep dark secrets."
575,575,Ought To Be Clowns,04/10/2012,Ian,The Second Mrs Tanqueray, Rose Kingston,"Stephen Unwin’s run of home-grown productions for the Rose Kingston, where he is also Artistic Director, continues with this revival of Arthur W Pinero’s Victorian melodrama, The Second Mrs Tanqueray. Respectable member of society and widower Aubrey Tanqueray scandalises his friends when he suddenly announces he is to be married again. The issue is that his intended, Mrs Paula Jarman, is a woman with a past – a sexual one at that – but his determination to go through with the marriage leaves Paula feeling increasingly alienated from her new world and particularly from her new stepdaughter. And try as they might to overcome their differences, secrets from the past threaten to overwhelm everyone.  Though meant to be something of a mismatched couple, James Wilby and Laura Michelle Kelly struggle to convince that there could have been anything between Aubrey and Paula, both performances missing some psychological depth to point us to the truth of their characters. Wilby does mannered Victoriana extremely well but seldom gives a sense of real man behind the bluff exterior, and Kelly’s whole air a little too girlish, rarely feeling born of the frustrations of a life already lived though the second half does see her start to darken the tone effectively.  Paul Wills’ design is a rather inventive use of the space, going some way to addressing the intimacy-sapping cavernous nature of the stage at the Rose, though the use of props does expose some of the emptiness. Mark Bouman’s lavish costumes look a treat, against the sober tones of the production, Paula’s vivid emerald dress – and house guest Mabel’s golden one too as we come to see – suggest birds of paradise trapped in a cage. It is hard to gauge what effect Corin Buckeridge’s music for the interludes is meant to have though, an oddly diverse collection of shards that weirdly skew the mood."
576,576,Ought To Be Clowns,19/11/2019,Ian,Dear Evan Hansen, Noël Coward Theatre,"After seeing Dear Evan Hansen, you realise that its title can be taken two ways. It’s the salutation on a letter that precipitates a world of trouble for the awkward teenager and those around him as per Steven Levenson’s effectively contemporary book. But it also ultimately emerges as an affectionate form of address, troublingly so as the show latterly pulls its punches around some of the harder-hitting topics that it raises. High-school senior Evan’s life is crippled by social anxiety. His hard-working single mum barely has time for him, he’s got no mates to speak of, and his therapist keeps setting him homework. Then when one of his classmates Connor Murphy dies by suicide, a chink of light unexpectedly cracks through his depression, as an unlikely chain of events leads him to claiming that they were best friends in order to emotionally support the grieving family.   As well-intentioned his efforts, Evan can’t help but let the lies get bigger and bigger as perversely, his life gets better and better. Levenson sensitively explores the seductiveness of the ready-made family life Evan finds with the Murphys, reciprocal in its benefits. And he cleverly examines the hollowness of social activism as performed on social media as a passing trend, a hashtag to follow for a week with little or no interest in whether it is real or not. Searchingly powerful stuff in Michael Greif’s production, particularly as it is acted here by recent drama school graduate Sam Tutty, who gives Evan a thoroughly credible gangly teenage awkwardness dialled up the max with its hands screwed up tight. Rebecca McKinnis and Lauren Ward also both excel as the maternal figures in his life, each dealing with their own complex set of feelings while trying to deal with the pandora’s box of Evan’s mental health.  It’s a shame then that for all this complexity, the ending feels like a punt for dramatic neatness as it seeks to wrap everything up with a bow, undermining the seriousness of Evan’s wrongdoings and the reality of ongoing mental health conditions. Throw in the cult status already built up around this musical – upon the reveal of stalkerish behaviour at one point, I couldn’t believe the romantic coos around me – dear Evan Hansen? More like oh dear Evan Hansen!"
577,577,Ought To Be Clowns,22/09/2011,Ian,Di and Viv and Rose, Hampstead Downstairs,"Continuing their practice of showcasing new writing in the Michael Frayn space downstairs now with a generous donation from the Peter Wolff Trust, the Hampstead Theatre’s newest play is Amelia Bullmore’s Di and Viv and Rose. And though these shows are flying under the radar a little with no official press coverage, there has been no stinting on top quality cast and creatives to deliver an absolutely brilliant evening of effervescent fun, sparky comedy and heart-rending emotion. Anna Mackmin, she of the delightful Me and My Girl in Sheffield, directs here a trio of top actresses: Nicola Walker (who I once accidentally terrorised in a dry cleaners on the Holloway Road – mistaken identity, breadmakers, it’s a long story…sorry Nicola), Tamzin Outhwaite (who gets huge love for brilliantly telling a grumpy audience member where to go at Matilda) and Claudie Blakley (about whom I have no stories but I still love her anyway). Di and Viv and Rose follows three young women as they arrive at university in 1983 and soon end up sharing a house in which deep friendships are formed over the next three years as they go through the ups and downs of student living. We then revisit the friends 15 years later and again another 12 to see how their lives have turned out and how the friendship has changed over time.  Bullmore’s play works so very well because although she touches on a world of larger issues and themes, her focus remains so very strongly on the central subject, that of friendship; the comfort it can provide, the joy it can bring, how it endures in times of crisis and how it changes over time as life and lovers interfere. And by creating three such individual yet complementary characters, we are instantly drawn into their world of drinking cider out of bowls, late night cramming, nights of reckless abandon at the student union notching up the bedpost and dancing like a loon to Prince on full volume. For me, part of this came from the recognition of the vagaries of shared student living (I, too, fully subscribed to the writings of Madhur Jaffrey) and the genius 80s soundtrack but it is also, crucially, extremely funny with it. So much so that when darker shadows fall, the impact hits like a sledgehammer, taking the breath away. Claudie Blakley is just sensational as the dippy Rose, her heart as big as her desire to sleep with as many boys as possible, her non-sequiturs are excellently delivered yet we are always laughing with her, never at her, a fabulous performance. Nicola Walker makes a determined Viv, studious and ambitious, forthright in her opinions about others yet not quite able to self-analyse quite so well. And Tamzin Outhwaite as Di, embracing the opportunity to well, embrace her lesbianism is a beautiful mix of sporty self-confidence, affable warmth and a moving tenderness. All three are forced to show strength, both inner and outer, throughout the course of the play and so whilst we laugh, a lot, there’s also moments of devastating emotion which will touch you deeply."
578,578,Ought To Be Clowns,06/03/2014,mag9l,Blithe Spirit, Gielgud,"Less of a review (the show is still previewing) and more of a musing on ‘actor tourism’ which is surely the main reason for this umpteenth revival of Noël Coward’s Blithe Spirit. The announcement of Angela Lansbury’s return to the London stage after nearly forty years was met with a surprisingly huge outpouring of excitement which subsequently went into overdrive with her elevation to damehood in the New Year. And such veneration is curious to observe when one is on the outside of it. I think I missed the memo about Lansbury. I mean I’m pretty sure I’ve been in the same room when Murder She Wrote has been on but it was never something I’ve been enthusiastic about and in my personal pantheon of leading ladies, I have to say she is a long way off national treasure status. And clearly this will be controversial as evidenced from the audience in the Gielgud though – her arrival onstage was applauded, her exits were whooped, her curtain call garnering a considerable standing ovation. Was she worth it? It’s hard to say in all honesty. There’s something admirable in watching an 88 year old hoof it about on such a high profile stage and there’s a delightful twinkle in her eye that gets her a long way. But for me, her diction was terrible meaning I could barely understand her at times, her miked-up voice lacking clarity and the play is just pure hokum, an overextended riff on faux spirituality, wayward wives and general upper-class twonkery. So the standing o felt hugely indulgent, a recognition of a lifetime’s work rather than what has just been witnessed, which I suppose is fair enough if you’re that way inclined but it feels a little beside the point. I adore Vanessa Redgrave but I wouldn’t have ovated at Much Ado because I loved her in Coriolanus… And I remain too stolidly British to entertain applauding entrances and/or mid-scene exits, it just feels rude to interrupt the rhythm of a production in such a way – a time and a place has been provided for you to show your appreciation! "
579,579,Ought To Be Clowns,20/05/2017,Ian,Love in Idleness, Apollo,"And I’m glad I returned as I found myself enjoying the play a lot more second time round. Taking it for what it is, which is a Rattigan curiosity rather than a revelatory (re)discovery, this light-hearted comedy is actually an interesting addition to the West End’s early summer. Its main joy remains the relaxed but realistically palpable chemistry between Best and Anthony Head, as widow Olivia and government minister Sir John Fletcher whose relationship comes under strain when her son Michael returns from four years evacuated to Canada. He’s come back an opinionated 18 year old, a would-be leftist firebrand but closer to a petulant brat and Edward Bluemel has great fun with him, even if ultimately the character is somewhat one-dimensional. Better are the hints of vibrant character that come from Nicola Sloane’s parlour maid and Vivienne Rochester’s secretary even in their brief scenes, and Head is smoothly charming as Fletcher. "
580,580,Ought To Be Clowns,18/12/2018,Ian,The Merry Wives of Windsor, RSC at the Barbican,"Fiona Laird’s production of The Merry Wives of Windsor is the third of the RSC’s show to open at the Barbican this winter and whilst it is certainly an eye-catching revival with its Only Way is Essex tendencies, it really wasn’t the one for me."
581,581,Ought To Be Clowns,04/05/2014,mag9l,Orton, Above the Stag,"The tempestuous relationship between ground-breaking playwright Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell has long been a source of fascination for writers and retellings of their story can be found in many formats. Including now, a musical, as Richard Silver and Sean J Hume’s Orton takes its own bow on the stage of the rehoused Above the Stag, a mere studded collar’s throw from notorious Vauxhall hangout The Hoist (in a touch which would surely have amused Orton). The show simply follows the pair from the heady excitement of the day they met at RADA through to Orton’s untimely end at the hands of Halliwell and a hammer sixteen years later. But though there is a most macabre ending in sight, the journey there ends up being rather entertaining, impressively told with humour, intelligence and no little campery. And for a new musical, it has a pleasingly strong sense of its own identity, a small-scale triumph in its own right. Richard Dawes and Andrew Rowney as Orton and Halliwell are both really effective in Tim McArthur’s even-handed production, the vicissitudes of their relationship take in culpability on both sides and though it doesn’t seek to exculpate Halliwell, it is interesting to see potential reasons for how he was driven to such extreme action. The swift growth of Orton’s literary reputation combined with his already vastly promiscuous nature would have challenged even the most patient of lovers."
582,582,Ought To Be Clowns,23/04/2014,mag9l,The Silver Tassie, National Theatre,"Commemorating the start of the First World War has turned into something of a full-time business for the nation’s theatres but in reviving the rarely-seen 1927 Sean O’Casey anti-war piece The Silver Tassie, the National Theatre has hit on something special. The play is structurally extraordinary in the difference of its four acts – a vaudevillian take on an Irish household transforms memorably into the visceral horror of a battlefield haunted by music hall songs, after the interval a hospital-set comedy eventually turns into stark realism, as the shattering effects of war on society are laid bare. Howard Davies’ epic production forges through blood and noise to find a most painful truth. The cumulative effect may challenge some and is certainly disorientating at times but it also has a form of progression that feels natural, like feeling a way through what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Opening in the Dublin tenement home of the Heegans, the play riffs on Irish stereotypes through the clownish figures of Sylvester and Simon and the neighbourhood archetypes they teasingly mock but soon allows young gun Harry Heegan to take centre stage, boasting the trophy – the Silver Tassie – he and his teammates have won playing soccer, just before they head off to join the British war effort.  The way in which this Expressionist play unfolds means that notions such as character development and narrative thrust just aren’t appropriate here. Instead, there’s a deeply poetic and incredibly moving heart as the brutal anonymity of war, and particularly the insidious class structures of WWI, are plainly presented, that same facelessness bleeding into the instant aftermath in a hospital ward that could just as easily be purgatory. The clarity that comes in the final act thus feels even more powerful for having been so hard-earned, the anguish felt by those who have returned injured that much more keenly felt as they realise how society has moved on without them.  It is tempting to think that O’Casey’s play could have been inspirational for many a playwright who followed. In some lights, Sylvester and Simon’s carousing foreshadows Waiting for Godot’s Estragon and Vladimir and the dense musical tapestry of Act II feels inextricably linked to the fabric of Oh! What A Lovely War. Such anti-war sentiments may be more commonplace now but to think this was written less than a decade after the ‘Great War’ is remarkable (and unfashionably so for at the time, WB Yeats rejected the play for the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, citing O’Casey’s lack of combat experience at least in part)."
583,583,Ought To Be Clowns,08/02/2018,Ian,Bicycles and Fish, VAULT Festival,"As she acknowledges from the start, Katie Arnstein’s one-woman show Bicycles and Fish is light on both bicycles, and fish. What it is heavy on, is the story of when, aged 16 in a village outside of Lichfield, she stopped being a girl and became a woman, a decision the world made for her. Blending wittily concise stand-up with songs that combine the musical comedy sensibility of the inspirational Victoria Wood with the characterful musicality of Gywneth Herbert plus the forthright power of the confessional, this is a seriously impactful hour. And it is a well-constructed one too. Arnstein’s writing is so beautifully rich that you can’t help but get hooked on any number of fascinating details that pass as she evokes that feeling of possibility that comes from being a carefree kid. I’d happily watch a spin-off show about the Lichfield Song Contest, or the GPs’ receptionist and her blush-saving acronyms, or June and her broken egg, or the school photo – particularly the school photo!  The result is that you can’t help but be thoroughly charmed by the twinkling warmth of her slightly self-deprecating persona. Which further means that when the serious stuff comes, as it must, it hits with an even harder, eye-wincing force. Stories of sexism and sexual assault are never easy to hear and Arnstein rightly never lets us forget just how much can be lost. But though deeply personal and deeply felt, Bicycles and Fish looks up and looks forward. Questioning our tendency to remember famous sons and not famous daughters, offering advice on where to find help, advice on how to not act like a dick and as a collage of voiceovers kicks in, it is the words of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Jo Brand that start to drown out the Inverdales and the Trumps. With more clear-sighted and affecting work like this, Arnstein’s could well be a voice to add to that list. Definitely recommended. Running time: 50 minutes (without interval)
Booking until 11th February"
584,584,Ought To Be Clowns,26/04/2014,mag9l,Blues in the Night, Hackney Empire,"According to the publicity, the New York Post called Blues in the Night “a dark-toned honey of a show” which I guess sounds better, and less potentially contentious, in an American accent. The show at hand was conceived by Sheldon Epps in 1980 and is Blues in the Night, a revue which weaves together music by the likes of Bessie Smith, Duke Ellington, Johnny Mercer, Ida Cox and many more with the sheerest of narrative threads. It makes for an often thrilling evening but one which I found curiously uneven.  The set-up for the show sees three female characters – The Lady, The Woman, The Girl – bemoan the troubles in their love lives which all centre on the same guy – The Man. Moving around the Chicago hotel in which they all reside, the gift of these tremendous songs is used to tease open their relationships and the many stages of love they experience with The Man, whilst he also gets to chime in about his experiences, mainly with songs like Duke Ellington and Mack David’s ‘I’m Just A Lucky So-and-So’. Moving to a catalogue that perhaps comes more naturally than the one Tori Amos created for him, Clive Rowe is a marvellous central presence, full of a cheeky charisma that makes the glint in his eye shine even brighter and an easy swagger that commands. But the limelight is well and truly taken by an awesome performance from Sharon D Clarke as The Lady, making the act of singing seem like a natural extension of her self, whether swinging through the bawdy wit of Razaf and Wilson’s ‘Kitchen Man’ or breaking hearts with the fiercely felt intensity of Jimmy Davis’ ‘Lover Man’."

586,586,Ought To Be Clowns,25/09/2010,Ian,Hay Fever, Rose Theatre Kingston,"In mounting a new production of Noël Coward’s Hay Fever, the Rose Theatre, Kingston has managed another casting coup after attracting Judi Dench out west earlier this year, although their plans haven’t quite gone according to schedule. Celia Imrie agreed to take on the lead role of Judith Bliss, but subsequent filming commitments meant she can only fulfil half the run, so Nichola McAuliffe will be stepping in for the final two weeks. Still, a very interesting cast under Stephen Unwin’s direction, makes this an intriguing proposition. Set in the Blisses’ family home in the 1920s, Judith, a recently retired stage actress, David, a self-absorbed novelist, and their two equally unconventional children make for a eccentric family grouping given to melodramatic theatrical excesses. On the weekend we see them, they have each invited someone, unbeknownst to the others, a stuffy diplomat, a shy girl, an athletic boxer and a fashionable sophisticate and the scene is set for comedic chaos as endless scenes and permutations are played out by the Blisses and their unsuspecting house guests. At the centre of this whirl of theatrical confusion and merriment, Celia Imrie continues to confirm her dame-in-waiting status with a wonderfully de trop performance. Whether its singing a little French ditty at the piano, throwing herself with abandon on the chaise longue or her continual dramatic poses, one never loses sight of the fact that this is a woman who simply cannot stop performing, but Imrie at times also suggests the woman beneath the character, who is genuinely touched by some praise for her work. I sometimes feel I could just watch her read the phone book, but Imrie really does deliver the goods here. Alexandra Gilbreath is a pure vampy delight as Myra Arundel with a startlingly husky vocal delivery and buckets of sexual chemistry. Her dry chuckles, acerbic witticisms and endless pose-striking (though not quite as extensive as Judith’s), combined with a sleek black bob and flapper dress, left me feeling weak at the knees and disturbingly attracted to her! But good as Imrie and Gilbreath are, they are given a run for their money by Adrian Lukis’ Greatham who is frequently scene-stealingly good. Whether it is his stilted attempts at conversation with Jackie or his physical comedy moves (never has leaning casually against a piano seemed so funny), he is excellent. Sam Swainsbury is good as Sandy, but ironically given how much he eats in Act III he has lost a bit of weight and as he is playing somewhat against type here as a public schoolboy sort and so he lost a certain amount of the yumminess I have come to associate with him (and I’m allowed to say this as a blogger not a critic!) There’s an impressive professional stage debut from Georgia Maguire as the precocious Sorel, her mannerisms nicely influenced by her mother and Joshua McGuire as a swishy Simon, whose initial impressions and longing glance at Sandy’s posterior rather belies his later ardour for Myra, although given my reaction to Gilbreath and history with Swainsbury, this is utterly understandable to me! The set is lovely, with a split level aspect allowing for a nice landing leading off to rooms upstairs but it did feel like it could have done with an extra door stage right up top as the attention to detail was so good everywhere apart from this one exit which was just a curtain. It is extremely well-dressed, stuffed full with all sorts of bohemian ephemera, with an emphasis on Japanese trinkets and fans, but the inclusion of a boat out the back seemed a step too far. The view through the window suggested a house right on the river, but with the boat there too and people disappearing through the door to the gardens, the perspective seemed distractingly wrong. Costumes are largely great but it must be said that there is a disappointing lack of actual silk pyjamas here. There’s lots of silk dressing gowns and a couple of lovely wide-legged trouser suits in silk (Judith’s orange one was my favourite) but none of the pyjamas on display fulfilled the brief, being more cotton-based, I’m sure Mr Coward would turn in his grave! I really did enjoy this production of Hay Fever, it is full of nice characterisations, excellent performances and some strong delivery of Coward’s bon mots. But at the same time, I couldn’t help a small feeling that there was nothing particularly new on display here, this is familiar territory being retread. But its final moral of the strength of familial bonds is touching as ever and given genuine feeling here and all in all, I do have to say that this Hay Fever is most likely worth the trip to zone 6! How does it compare to the WE revivial with DJD a few years agoI thought that was pretty hilarious and there was some excellent A list casting thereI am seeing the Rose version tonight! Hope you enjoyed it.I honestly don't remember that much about the Dench production, apart from thinking how fun it was to see her playing a bit against type. Looking back at my notes though (which are on here too), I apparently wasn't much impressed with the supporting cast!"
587,587,Ought To Be Clowns,01/06/2019,Ian,White Pearl, Royal Court,"On the one hand, there’s lots to appreciate about White Pearl, a play about Asian women, written and directed by women of Asian descent and starring them too. Its foregrounding of non-native English voices, subject matter so atypical for the UK, its very programming on a major London stage – this is important stuff. On the other, it’s not a fantastic piece of writing and as significant as its presence here is – something which should not be left unremarked – nothing is gained by not being frank. Anchuli Felicia King’s play straddles the world of satire and comedy but ultimately satisfies as neither and there’s a reliance on some troubling dramatic tropes.

589,589,Ought To Be Clowns,12/04/2015,mag9l,the final night of Made in Dagenham, Adelphi,"So here we have it, barely six months after opening, the machinery at Ford Dagenham has ground to a halt for the last time and Made in Dagenham has played its final performance. To say I’m gutted is putting it mildly, this was a piece of shining musical theatre that I took to my heart from the first time I saw it and again on my subsequent two revisits. You can read Review #1 Review #2 and Review #3. But the opportunity to see it one last time was one I couldn’t resist and if a show has to shutter, then the special energy of a closing night is probably the time to do it.  And I’m so glad that we went back for more (this is the first show I’ve ever dayseated twice and you can count the number of times I’ve dayseated on one hand!) as it was a truly special night. The occasion aside, it was a genuine pleasure to see and hear the show again and the cast were on fire to a (busy wo)man. Adrian der Gregorian has never sounded better than pouring all his heart and soul into ‘The Letter’, Sophie-Louise Dann tore up the stage and her colleagues’ tear ducts in ‘In An Ideal World’, Mark Hadfield’s Harold Wilson went even further over the top (if such a thing were possible), and Heather Craney’s goofy Clare became almost unbearably heart-breaking with such emotion on show. I could list the entire company here but I’ll stop, save to express a renewed appreciation for Gemma Arterton. Not only did she deliver a showstoppingly profound performance, holding it together until the very end, but then composing herself to deliver a heartfelt and passionate speech about the love the whole company and auditorium have for this “British and brilliant” musical, sparing us none of the indignation at having to close and rightly calling out the puzzling degree of persistent negativity from certain quarters which will have done nothing to help its fortunes. The world of new musical theatre, particularly British writing, is a fraught one and there’s little knowing which shows will survive and attract those all-important audiences. Betty Blue Eyes (6 months) was another short-lived contender that deserved more and whilst I may not have particularly enjoyed Stephen Ward (4 months) and From Here To Eternity (6 months), it was still surprising that the kudos of the writing talent behind them didn’t keep the wolves from the door a little longer. But such are the rigours of the commercial market. A world where Thriller Live is in the top 20 longest running shows ever in the West End, where Beatles’ tribute concert Let It Be has returned for a third time, where Cats is revived with a rap in it for da kidz and Nicole Scherzinger somehow gets nominated for a Best Supporting Actress in a Musical Olivier… Obviously there’s a huge amount of personal taste at work here but similarly I think there’s a huge amount more that we could be doing to help new musicals to get a little breathing space and find their place in the world – if indeed they have one. We need more a couple of decent mid-sized theatres in town so the pressure to fill a vast house is something they can build up to rather than be hamstrung by from the outset, we need a refocus away from jukebox retreads so that an appetite and appreciation for original music can be (re)cultivated, we need a reality check in this brave new world of social media – if you don’t like a show then fine, but then don’t feel the need to search Twitter and reply virulently to anyone talking about it. For example. "
590,590,Ought To Be Clowns,05/05/2018,Ian,Priscilla Queen of the Desert, Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch,"It’s easy to dismiss the jukebox musical as a lazy iteration of the form. And whilst there are shows that worthy of such a slight, there are others which deserve far better. Stephan Elliott and Allan Scott’s adaptation of Priscilla Queen of the Desert is one of those, a musical which has worked hard to integrate its music into its storytelling in interesting and different ways, allied with a book that is moving and funny and just a little fabulous. Directed by Douglas Rintoul for Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch, this production marks the show’s regional professional premiere. One of Rintoul’s innovations is to make this an actor-musician production, a decision that pays off handsomely here. There’s a wonderful sense of democracy about this ensemble, who subsume the singing parts of the Divas here, as everyone gets a moment (or three) to shine under the Australian sun. To name but a few, a burst of stunning vocals from Molly-Grace Cutler aka Keyboard 2/Jules, the raucous slide of Natasha Lewis’ trombone, the sure-fingered delicacy of Josh Tye’s acoustic guitar (at its best as the interval comes to a close). And they provide an ideal backdrop, along with the use of a community chorus to bolster the various crowd scenes, to this ultimately rather simple and touching road movie of a plot. A gay man preparing to come to terms with being a father, a young performer reaching for the Kylie-soundtracked heavens, a transgender woman daring to dream of love. And respectively, Tom Giles’ Mitzi, Daniel Bailey’s Felicia and Mark Inscoe’s Bernadette (the show’s MVP) balance the emotional heart of their stories with a winning gregariousness."
591,591,Ought To Be Clowns,28/09/2019,Ian,Glass. Kill. Bluebeard. Imp., Royal Court,"Directed by James Macdonald, they’re an often extraordinary combination, circling around ideas of myths and stories with her customary precision and linguistic expertise. Married to the ingenuity of Miriam Buether’s set designs, each cannily different to the other as they loom out of the darkness of Jack Knowles’ lighting, it is a full-on auditory treat. And that’s before we even mention a cast that includes Deborah Findlay and Toby Jones.  Whether ornaments lined up on a shelf (Glass), gods despairing at human behaviour (Kill), friends amazed that one of them was a serial killer (Bluebeard’s Friends) or a family with serious secrets (Imp), we’re constantly taken to a place where every line is charged with significance. Let your attention drop for a second and risk miss devastating underlying themes of abuse and complicity."
592,592,Ought To Be Clowns,13/09/2011,Ian,The Wild Bride, Lyric Hammersmith,"I have to admit to not being entirely won over by Kneehigh. They spoken of with such reverence but the handful of shows of theirs that I have seen haven’t really won me over to their style. I found the archness of The Red Shoes lacking in emotion, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg tried too hard to force too much quirkiness, A Matter of Life and Death just left me baffled! But Emma Rice’s retelling of a Hungarian fairytale, The Handless Maiden, retitled here as The Wild Bride feels like something closer to Kneehigh’s raison d’être, combining light with the dark, humour with the tragedy, and consequently I found it highly enjoyable. When a miller accidentally sells his only daughter to the Devil and has to chop her hands off as it turns out she is too pure to be taken, the girl ends up in the harsh world of the forest where hardship is endured, opportunity presents itself but the Devil is always keeping a watchful eye. The company of six – actors, musicians, performers, dancers, artists – tell the story in typical Kneehigh style, embracing a world of influences the most significant of which are the enchanted dark forests of the Brothers Grimm with their mysterious feel and the American South of the Great Depression, with the twang of blues guitar never far away. The end result is something close to magic. The way in which the three women represent three stages of the girl’s life is beautifully essayed, allowing the individual strengths of each performer to shine through but never letting us forget they are three parts of the whole. Audrey Brisson, a former Cirque Du Soleil artist, the wide-eyed youngest part, ‘The Girl’, her heart broken by her father’s unwitting betrayal and her burgeoning sexuality irresistible to the Devil is powerfully portrayed, there’s such an easy grace about her movement. Patrycja Kujawska’s expressive physicality as ‘The Wild’ is just sensational as she wordlessly takes us from the fear of roaming the forest helplessly with just stumps for hands, to the playful joy that comes from her meeting with the Prince and the new life he offers, through to the sorrow that inevitably follows on. And Éva Magyar’s ‘The Woman’ carries the weight of experience with dignity, her wildness mellowed by motherhood and ultimately rewarded in a moving finale. Etta Murfitt’s choreography often has the other two echoing movements of the lead to further underscore their inter-connectedness. Stuart McLoughlin makes for a charismatic Deep South gentleman of a Devil, often strumming away on his guitar whilst waiting for his chance to strike, and there’s some nice doubling from Stuart Goodwin as the hapless father who later re-emerges as an exuberant Scottish Prince who falls for this mysterious woman yet falls prey to the Devil’s machinations to try and drive them apart. But where Kneehigh have really succeeded here is in returning to a clarity and simplicity of their artistic vision, there is little here that seems superfluous but rather there’s an organic feel to every aspect of the production. The various influences melded into an effective whole as exemplified by Stu Barker music, which folds in the Americana of country and bluegrass with Eastern European laments and folk dances, Ian Ross playing much of it but ably assisted by multi-talented company, Brisson’s exceptionally gorgeous voice and Kujawska’s violin-playing in particular standing out. There’s a slightly incongruous moment where the live music gives way to the icy electronica of Portishead’s ‘Machine Gun’ but it does work well in context."
593,593,Ought To Be Clowns,11/04/2011,Ian,The Great British Musical, Criterion,"The Great British Musical was a showcase event at the Criterion Theatre, put together by the production company Perfect Pitch to celebrate British musical theatre both new and old through the performances of a cracking company of West End stars both established and upcoming. It was compered by Stephen Fry, the evening was led by Paul Herbert’s musical direction and supported by young performers from the MTA. We were treated to songs from shows that are currently open: George Stiles and Anthony Drewe gave us a mini comedy routine before launching into a medley from Betty Blue Eyes including the title song which worked and ‘Nobody’ which I wasn’t too sure about (I’m still longing to hear the promised version by Liza); Steven Webb and Jack Shalloo gave us their ‘Long Sunday Afternoon/That Guy’ from Blood Brothers and Lloyd-Webber was well-represented too, especially by Stuart Matthew Price’s ‘Heaven On Their Minds’ from Jesus Christ Superstar. Shows that are no longer running were also featured, the most emotional of which was definitely Love Story and it was a delight, though tinged with sadness, to see Emma Williams and Michael Xavier reprising ‘Everything We Know’ (although it would have been nice to see ‘Pasta’ again!). And Jack Shalloo’s run through ‘Picture Book’ from Departure Lounge was a nice reminder of that show’s short run at the Waterloo East Theatre last year. I was personally a little disappointed to see Webb teaming up with Julie Atherton for their Just So medley, having seen it quite recently at her cabaret show, but then not everyone made it into the Trafalgar Studios 2 and her rendition of ‘Wait A Bit’ is something truly special that I will never tire of. Some of the fun moments came with unexpected renditions of songs, sometimes gender-flipping, the best of these being Michael Xavier’s passionate ‘Tell Me It’s Not True’ from Blood Brothers, backed by the ensemble. I was less keen on Alfie Boe’s ‘As If We Never Said Goodbye’ from Sunset Boulevard, a little bit too grandstanding rather than emotionally truthful, but Hadley Fraser & Dougal Irvine’s guitar-led medley from The Lion King was good fun. But just as important as reflecting back is looking forward to the future and the talent that is being nurtured by Perfect Pitch, represented here by Laurence Mark Wythe, Dougal Irvine and Stuart Matthew Price. Particularly interesting sounding were Irvine’s new show The Buskers Opera featured by ‘Do You Want A Baby Baby?’ performed brightly by Emma Barton; Paul Keating’s ‘Time Will Tell’ from Wythe’s Through The Door and Price’s self-penned ‘Where I Wanna Be’."
594,594,Ought To Be Clowns,14/01/2017,mag9l,The Wild Party, Hope,"Joseph Moncure March’s narrative poem managed the remarkable feat of having two musical adaptations thereof running in the same year in New York, one of which – by Michael John LaChiusa – will be the first show in the newly rebranded The Other Palace next month. Getting in early though is Mingled Yarn Theatre Company with their own cabaret-influenced interpretation of The Wild Party, running now at The Hope Theatre. It is musical, rather than a musical, as the show opens with a marvelously sultry take on Britney Spears’ ‘Toxic’ delivered by the supremely confident Anna Clarke (a performer so good you suspect she must have some Strallen blood!). And as she’s joined by Joey Akubeze, we’re soon whisked away into the decadent world of vaudeville turns Queenie and Burrs and their fabulously louche but fatally lustful lifestyle, complete with aggressive fruit-eating. Director Rafaella Marcus has her pair play all the parts in the poem, all of the guests alongside the key couple, and it is a gift of rapid-fire characterisation. The rhyming verse, once you get used to its lilting cadences, brings a vivid sense of raucous life and Minglu Wang’s set and costume design plays up the theatricality of it and its delivery, layers of clothing stripped away to reveal new outfits, new personas, new emotions as the night progresses. Reinterpreted pop classics (Carly Rae Jepsen, White Stripes, even Bon Jovi in a surprisingly effective take on ‘You Give Love A Bad Name’ that needs to be recorded) again add to the meta-ness of the production but perhaps sap a little of the pace. But Will Alder’s lighting intensifies the dark jealousy that lies at the heart of the story and the overall effect is a highly charismatic mix of gin, sex, violence and pop – what more could you want from a party?"
595,595,Ought To Be Clowns,05/04/2010,Ian,The Notebook of Trigorin, Finborough,"I think Phil Willmott and I would be very good friends. Creator of two of my favourite musicals in recent months, joyous works both, and whilst I may not have entirely approved of F**king Men, I can see where he’s coming from as it were. So I was quite upset when Phil went and ruined our friendship by choosing Chekhov as his next project, why Phil why? Still, all is not lost as it is at least Chekhov once removed. The Notebook of Trigorin is described as a ‘free adaptation’ of Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull by American playwright Tennessee Williams. It’s quite the moment for Williams rarities in London with one of his earlier plays Spring Storm at the National Theatre and this Notebook both being performed for the first time in the capital. It mostly follows the plot of Chekhov’s original, so Masha loves Constantine who loves Nina who loves Trigorin who is also loved by Arkadina. Williams’ conceit is to make Trigorin the focus of the play and with more than a hint of autobiographical detail, makes him a closeted homosexual. So the tangle of relationships, with the destructive mother/son dynamic between Arkadina and Constantine at its core, becomes centred around the self-possessed Trigorin who is in the midst of all the tragedy in the play, yet remains unscathed by it. It is a strange mixture, with all the requisite Chekhovian tragedy but heavily suffused with Williams’ trademark dialogue and languorous atmosphere. It is familiar yet different and it mostly makes for an interesting evening. The sharper characterisations are a welcome addition, there’s a greater sense of purpose to many of the players, but at the same time, there’s oddities. In making Trigorin’s sexuality ambivalent, Williams adds very little to the play, this thread is not pursued to any depth and it changes nothing ultimately. Tennessee Williams spent a lifetime haunted by The Seagull and finally realised his dream of adapting it two years before his death, and so perhaps there’s a touch more vanity in this project than is strictly acceptable. The performances were all good: standouts in the ensemble were Andrea Hall’s Masha, deeply unhappy and never without a glass in her hand, she communicated her pain as much with her eyes as with her words and Morgan James’ drawling Dorn, a lascivious, seedy doctor. Great attention has obviously been paid to the vocal work and it shows in a range of impressive convincing and constant accents. The only weak point was in the slight miscasting of Rob Heaps as Constantin: he looks perfect as a Russian and would fit right into a regular production of The Seagull, but his pale looks and curly locks meant his accent was just at complete odds with his appearance. His performance was still strong though, painfully intense and unable to deal with his mother’s inability to connect with him. As the vain, self-centred Arkadina, Carolyn Backhouse does well, capturing the narcissism of this actress who wants the world’s attention at all times, full of nice touches (I adored the moment when she held a note as far away from her as possible to read it, unwilling to admit to her failing eyesight) but it would have been nice to see some genuine vulnerability in amongst all the over-acting and vamping. And as Trigorin, Stephen Billington brings a curiously mannered performance, all stiff upper lip and not enough allure in order for us to buy his appeal to the ladies of the house. And on a final note for all those Doctor Who nerds out there, after Donna’s mum in Spring Storm, Trinity Wells the American newsreader is in this! Lachele Carl is practically unrecognisable in the small role as Polina, but still effective. The set is simply dressed with some wrought iron detailing and wooden floorboards suggesting the balcony of a grand house and a touch of furniture at the back representing the study in which Trigorin does much of his writing. After the interval, the set is flipped so that we’re now in the office looking out onto the veranda. Initially this was quite effective, but it soon came to pass that it was really quite an awkward staging decision. With a bench and a desk and chair facing the back wall, the cast constantly have to twist round and put themselves in odd positions so that we’re not constantly watching their backs. It looks wrong, at one point there’s six people on stage and yet we can only see the face of one of them. The voiceover trick, used to describe the new scene at each scene change was as annoying here as it was at the National Theatre in Spring Storm. And whilst I’m being critical, almost all of the satin dresses need to be fitted better on Arkadina and Nina, being so close to the actors means that details like these are more glaring than usual. The Notebook of Trigorin is an odd one to categorise, it is both a Chekhov play and a Tennessee Williams play but at the same time it is neither fully and so it may leave fans of either feeling a little short-changed though I do think it is worth a visit. Those with no knowledge of The Seagull will find this an interesting piece too, just as long as the blocking in the second act can be sorted out a bit."
596,596,Ought To Be Clowns,22/05/2013,Ian,The Kite Runner, Theatre Royal Brighton,          
597,597,Ought To Be Clowns,05/10/2015,mag9l,Valhalla, Theatre503,"Hmm, a difficult one this. Due to the very very late withdrawal of Clint Dyer from the show, Theatre503’s Valhalla opened to critics with the playwright Paul Murphy stepping into the role, understandably performing script in hand. But whilst the ‘show must go on’ ethos is admirable, there’s no denying that forging on ahead in this manner does Jo McInnes’ production little favour, fatally unbalancing it for the moment whilst offering frustrating hints of what might have been and what might yet still be once Murphy is able to settle into the part. It doesn’t help that I found the play, from first-time writer Murphy, difficult. Valhalla did win the 2014 Theatre503 Playwriting Award from over 1600 other submissions but its gnomic, over-saturated nature is challenging. Explorations of eugenics and genetic testing rub shoulders with hints of Nordic folklore and witchcraft as a couple flee riots in the UK for the isolation of a Scandinavian research facility where they’re on the cusp of finding a cure for a global pandemic (what a time to be alive…). But this scientific advancement comes at personal cost, the terms of which the couple thrash out. So much is left vague and unnamed that it is hard to ever really buy into any of the conceits of the play, a crucial lack of credibility in either arena of love or science undermines it all. There’s little effective acting that can be done in a two-hander when one party is still firmly on book and so the spark that might have ignited writing that seems flat never came. "
598,598,Ought To Be Clowns,03/03/2012,Ian,A Streetcar Named Desire, Liverpool Playhouse,"Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire seems an unlikely choice to put on in a chilly March in Liverpool – the Donmar’s 2009 production took place at the height of summer – but Gemma Bodinetz’s production succeeds utterly in raising the temperature to create a rather stunning account of this classic play which remains taut and gripping throughout. When Blanche DuBois is forced to throw herself on the mercy of her sister Stella in her tiny New Orleans apartment, Blanche is ill-prepared for the clash of class, culture and character that comes from such proximity to Stella’s husband Stanley as he sets about dismantling her delusions of grandeur with chilling cruelty. The stifling heat of the French Quarter, and the ever-constricting atmosphere are perfectly simulated here in Gideon Davey’s design (plus special credit to Paul Keogan’s lighting) and Bodinetz expertly increases the pressure in ever-increasing increments to an almost unbearable level. There is dark stuff contained in here, I’d forgotten just how dark myself, yet we’re constantly reminded of Williams’ point that the world is full of pain and suffering and most people just get on with it. Yet Blanche has retreated from reality, glass in hand, Stanley’s completely differing take on life set him on a collision course with her and we are spared none of the violence as class warfare degenerates into domestic abuse on a horrific level. There’s something about the role of Blanche that holds the potential for actresses to really elevate their performances into the stratosphere. Rachel Weisz did it at the Donmar and so too does Amanda Drew here, in a simply incandescent turn as the faded Southern belle. It’s particularly pleasing as her talents were not well served by a small role in Butley but here she is given the room to spread out luxuriously and fill the entire auditorium with a glamorous charisma. She demands the attention with every gesture, every hint of emotion and is hauntingly, devastatingly moving as her mental decline sets in. Truly outstanding work. It is too their credit (and Drew’s too) that the supporting cast around her aren’t blown away by the star turn. But rather, Leanne Best’s Stella is a sweetly portrayed delight with an inner steel as she is ultimately forced to choose between sister and husband, Matthew Flynn brings an almost goofy charm to would-be perfect gentleman caller Mitch, and there’s Mandi Symonds, Stephen Fletcher and Annabelle Apsion all impressed in smaller roles. Sam Troughton’s Stanley suffered a little bit by comparison for me: he’s not Elliot Cowan (which is hardly his fault) but he didn’t really have the natural animalistic physicality that I wanted, resorting to just shouting a bit too often, though he played the conniving amorality with great skill and almost winning us round with his charm."

Adapted (though most freely I am told) by Tony Kushner from the 1636 L’Illusion Comique by Pierre Cornielle, who was a contemporary (or thereabouts) of Molière and Racine, the play is constructed as a potentially deft piece of meta-theatre, passing comment on the extraordinary capacity that the theatre to create its own universe and the illusionary nature of the very same. Kushner weaves his own idiosyncratic verbosity around this tale, though the result is something of a curious mix. Matters begin with the arrival of Pridamant at the grotto – Sarah Jane Prentice’s design and Howard Hudson’s lighting playing to the strengths of the railway arches – of noted magician Alcandre. He’s there to find out where Clindor, his estranged son is and Alcandre obliges, providing snippets of the last 15 years of his son’s life as he deals with a number of romantic entanglements and social adventures. But it is made clear that the scenes are all visions, the uncertainty of what we’re witnessing enhanced by the constant changing of the character’s names and we are joined with Pridamant in the journey of discovery to his son’s real fate. Though director Seb Harcombe may have conceived this as a showcase for the four recent RADA graduates in the ensemble, the show undeniably belongs to the more experienced in the cast. James Clyde taps into a deep anguish as the woeful and irascible Pridamant and Melanie Jessop is incandescent as the Prospera-like Alcandre, her silky presence dominates the stage and her powerful monologue forms an useful anchor for the whole production. Charlie Archer makes an impressive debut as the wayward son and I also liked the spikiness of Shanaya Rafaat’s maid; elsewhere though, an overplayed lisp detracted too much from one performance and a tendency to shoutiness revealed a few rough edges."
602,602,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2017,mag9l,Holding The Man, Brockley Jack,"At the end of the 2010 West End production of Tommy Murphy’s Holding The Man, his adaptation of Tim Conigrave’s novel about his relationship with a guy named John, I was so distraught that I wept in my seat at the Trafalgar Studios for several minutes. So the prospect of seeing it again was one I approached with caution, even as Big Boots Theatre Company intrigued me with their production at the Brockley Jack. Holding The Man is much more than your conventional relationship drama though, covering as it does their love affair from the mid 1970s until the early 1990s and thus staking its place as a first-hand documentation of the ravaging impact of the arrival of HIV/AIDS in the worldwide gay community. It is brutally, unflinchingly honest and as such, transcends any notion that the material is dated or that such plays are no longer relevant."
603,603,Ought To Be Clowns,03/05/2013,Ian,Smallholding, Nuffield,"Two former junkies break into an abandoned East Northamptonshire farmhouse – such is the opening premise of Chris Dunkley’s new play Smallholding, a co-production between Southampton’s Nuffield Theatre and the HighTide festival. But it soon becomes apparent that this 75 minute two-hander is no stereotypically sunken-cheeked tale of crackheads and crime but rather a brutally frank and insightful exploration of the cruel dynamics of addiction and co-dependency on a young couple trying to make a future for themselves. Signs look promising at first. Matti Houghton’s well-put-together Jen has a breezy determination to make good on the opportunities offered by her well-intentioned family and fresh out of rehab, Chris New’s edgily wiry Andy is full of positive thinking and enthusiasm for the bio-dynamic farming that is their chosen way forward. The thrill of setting up home together and making a new life soon wears thin though against the privations of rural life and the shadow of temptation that lingers unshakably over their relationship. As with his previous play The Soft of her Palm, Dunkley enjoys subverting expectations around his subject matter and so never allows his audience to settle into complacency. It’s a smart decision to make this pair functional drug addicts as it brings an added pathos to hear about their life before, their time at university, everything they share…and the playwright slowly reveals these pieces with an exceptional surehandedness which agonisingly tightens the downwards spiral of their tragedy. The writing remains well-balanced though, for all the pained detail like the black market for clean urine, there’s a cautious optimism in the recognition that some things are worth fighting for, some lines cannot be crossed. Director Patrick Sandford also whole-heartedly embraces the ambiguity of this world, as evidenced by the surreal touches he introduces, reminding us that our two protagonists may not necessarily be the most reliable of narrators, their account of events perhaps a little skewed, whether by the intoxication of substances or the intensity of the emotion that binds them together. And Houghton and New play into this with two outstanding performances, their palpable chemistry full of fizzing energy and unspoken connections that is simply irresistible."
604,604,Ought To Be Clowns,01/04/2017,mag9l,Sea Fret, Old Red Lion,"Is there another fringe theatre that transform itself oh so utterly as the Old Red Lion? You might not think it to look at the Angel pub theatre, with its inflexible seating on two sides, but clever programming and exciting creative thinking has meant that its playing space has constantly and consistently reinvented to great effect (wrestling ring, rooftops. 1930s New York) and new play Sea Fret is no different.  Designer Rūta Irbīte converts the stage into a section of the Suffolk coastline that writer Tallulah Brown grew up around and under Simon Gethin Thomas’ sun-bright lighting and Daniel Balfour burbling sound design, it looks absolutely gorgeous, transformative in the best possible way. And on this bit of beach, the tangled friendship of Ruby and Lucy plays out a key stress-test of a moment – the summer where they’re 18, where the choice between university and home has to be made. Lucy Carless’s Ruby is an elemental force, determined to get that final blowout of a party where Georgia Kerr’s Lucy is a tad more sensible, a tad more settled in her life knowing that she’s moving on. But even as Ruby opts to stay, the sea has other plans as the ground under their feet is eroding away and their homes are under threat, a fight both of their (single) parents are waging with an intransigent council."
605,605,Ought To Be Clowns,27/10/2012,Ian,Blue Sky, Hampstead Theatre Downstairs,"Ray enjoys plane-spotting. Since his wife died and his teenage daughter is growing up far too quickly for his liking, it has provided him with a much-needed reason to get out of the house and into the Shropshire countryside. But it is early 2003, Iraq is about to be invaded and there’s a strange buzz of activity around their little airfield. When childhood friend and freelance journalist Jane waltzes back into his life, trying to follow up a lead on a story about a missing Pakistani man last seen being forced onto a US plane, neither of them are prepared for just how far this story will reach. Blue Sky is a pointedly political new play by Clare Bayley for the Pentabus Theatre company and in the intimate theatre downstairs at the Hampstead, director Elizabeth Freestone makes inventive use of the room with some excellent creative collaborations. Staged in traverse, Naomi Dawson’s deceptively simple design segments the open space, Johanna Town’s runway-inspired lighting is cleverly used as Adrienne Quartly’s sound design expands the horizons of the production into the big bad world being investigated. With a remarkably refreshing lack of sentimentality, Sarah Malin makes Jane a coolly cosmopolitan figure, all wisecracks, dismissive putdowns and collected self-assuredness, which contrasts strongly with Jacob Krichefski’s endearing Ray, entirely comfortable in his small-town environment and stable geekery. And both are excellent in the depiction of an easily long-held relationship, which after some time apart, flickers into something potentially more as Ray struggles with his innate desire to turn the other cheek. Bayley’s attempts to give substantive back-stories to them is a little problematic though given the short running time and ultimately, they don’t seem entirely dramatically necessary in the context of the play. For when the focus is on the ethics of investigative journalism – particularly into a subject so conflicted between national security and civil liberties, all the more powerful as the characters don’t possess the hindsight that we have now – there’s a tautness of possibility, the hint of something huge about to explode. Bayley never goes that far in her writing, preferring to keep matters low-key and tinged with regret and melancholy, which somehow feels both respectfully apt and slightly underwhelming."
606,606,Ought To Be Clowns,02/11/2020,Ian,The Place I Call Home Festival,,"Paines Plough have always been a company to do theatre a bit differently so it is no surprise to see them responding innovatively to the restrictions imposed by coronavirus. The Place I Call Home is a two-week digital festival of new work, taking the opportunity to explore multiple mediums and international collaborations as three new bilingual plays take place across Zoom, email, WhatsApp and good old snail mail.  Pinging daily into WhatsApp, A Brief History of Struggle by Dipo Baruwa-Etti and Calle Fuhr presents 5 minute snapshots of conversations that might be overheard on park benches. Scenes switch between London and Dortmund and span 1928 to 2020 so the whole thing is necessarily quite fragmented. And as engaging some of the segments are, from burgeoning feminist rights to reactions to immense tragedy, there’s little sense of a cumulative dramatic effect to match the novel delivery. Also directed by Charlotte Bennett and Katie Posner, In Tandem takes place over via video and email as daily missives take us from day 19 to day 34 to day 47 in lockdown for two different pairs. Patrycja Durska and Paweł Kumięga play a couple in Kraków figuring out the most worthwhile way to pass time and Sharon D Clarke and Leanne Henlon portray a mother and daughter Zooming from their separate London homes.  Written by Travis Alabanza and Magdalena Zarębska-Wegrzyn, there’s a brilliantly contrasting energy between the two strands. In London, Ella’s concerns start off with her NHS worker mum keeping her plants alive but as PPE runs shorts and headlines run amok, their interactions deepen, their relationship shifting to accommodate the emotional realities of only being able to Zoom. I particularly enjoyed the way Alabanza worked in all kind of humour whilst still excavating with brutal honesty what it is to black in the UK.  Over in Poland, Zarębska-Wegrzyn follows a more ruminative thread. Martin and Teresa and and their lovely green sofa navigate the pressures that lockdown exerts on their marriage. He’s just happy watching his favourite cooking programme with his favourite cheese sandwich, she wants to seize the opportunity to do something new with their time. Their journey to finding some kind of middle ground is beautifully tender, speaking of a connection that is being revisited and renewed under these strained circumstances.  "

608,608,Ought To Be Clowns,09/09/2010,Ian,Bedlam, Shakespeare’s Globe,"The first play ever to be written for the Globe by a woman, Nell Leyshon’s Bedlam is the final play to open in this year’s set of offerings. A slice of life of those both in and around the Bethlem mental hospital in London, or Bedlam as it is better known. The plot as such centres around Dr Carew’s corrupt running of the asylum, concerned more with women and profit than observing the Hippocratic oath and actually caring for his patients. But the arrival of new patients and a much more socially aware doctor loosens his grip and soon everything begins to change. It is huge amount of fun and Jessica Swale’s direction has a very keen sense of the possibilities of playing in the Globe, especially with the yardlings. Soutra Gilmour’s design has the stage in a circle with a ramp going up one side, but if you’re in the yard, be prepared for all sorts of interaction, both on the floor and on the stage and a range of bodily fluids and liquids to come flying at you from the sides and indeed above! And it is so wonderfully musical, taking advantage of the rich archive to pull out a number of songs like ‘A Maid In Bedlam’ and ‘Oyster Nan’, covering ballads to bawdy drinking songs, and it all really works. Leyshon is careful to show us the one-size-fits-all mentality that existed and so the patients we see cover the whole gamut from clearly sane yet trapped to certifiably bonkers, yet all are treated the same with leeches and blood-letting amongst the remedies on display here. But contrasted with that is the hedonism and lack of responsibility that abounded in society as hilariously displayed in the upper classes in Lawrence’s garden parties (the English country garden one is a delight) and the lower classes through the mass addiction to gin. Life has its moments of anarchic fun both inside and outside the asylum but these are also tempered with moments of sobering reality. Performance-wise, it is hard to fault anyone in this ensemble, so many of whom are covering numerous roles in the two Henry IV plays (the runs of which have now been extended) and so must be working incredibly hard. Matters are helped by the multi-stranded nature of the play, so that there’s a fairly even division of labour here and no-one disappoints. I was pleased to see Barbara Marten get a lovely role here as Carew’s quietly dignified wife, a model of absolute compassion and with a gorgeous dress to boot; Sam Crane does an excellent fop as Lawrence, a wannabe poet with an easily turned head and a passion for plucking; Joseph Timms’ naïf Matthew was nicely played as was Sophie Duval’s brusque asylum nurse Sal, Phil Cheadle’s handsome forward-thinking doctor and Finty William’s astute Gardenia also brightened up the stage. Ella Smith’s bumptious gin maid was a comic delight, especially with her singing in the tavern songs and I have to mention Sean Kearns’ beautiful lament too which was just spine-tingling. With such strong performances and an absolutely wicked first half, it almost feels a shame to mention any weaknesses, but the play does begin to lose its way in the second half. Having set itself up as this huge slice of life without any real predominating storyline which works really well, it then proceeds to wrap up each thread neatly, far too neatly in fact and in doing so, loses some of the element of fun. And because it is a comedy, albeit one dealing with inhabitants of a mental asylum, it merely flirts with the more serious issues like the changing attitudes towards the causes of mental illness which it would have been interesting to explore more and the appalling idea of visiting hours at the asylum (extremely distasteful but often the only way they could raise finance). As it is, the announcement of the introduction of more humane care in the asylum just plays as the removal of everything fun about Bedlam!"
609,609,Ought To Be Clowns,26/11/2015,mag9l,Jest End, Waterloo East,"As with Forbidden Broadway, your enjoyment of Jest End relies heavily on a considerable familiarity with the theatrical landscape that it is poking fun at – the productions, the performers, the producers, the private in-jokes that make it tough to recommend for the uninitiated. Garry Lake’s musical revue premiered in 2007 and through a number of productions, updated each time, has adapted familiar showtunes and used them to parody the frolics and foibles of the West End and beyond. So ‘Defying Gravity’ from Wicked becomes ‘Rely On Me The Lead’, Matilda’s ‘The Smell of Rebellion’ turns into ‘Jest End of Rebellion’, ‘Memphis Lives In Me’ from Memphis becomes ‘My Fans Believe In Me’ etc etc. And issues like celebrity casting, ticket prices and the business practices of certain West End (and off-West End) impresarios are raked over the coals, but always with a twinkle in the eye even in the satire’s sharpest barbs.  But even at under two hours, with an entirely unnecessary interval that is, Jest End does feel overstretched. Great satire is hard to do for any length of time and there is a definite sense of the hit and miss about the range of targets here and also the choice. Jabs at John Barrowman and Mary Poppins raise a chuckle but hardly have their finger on the pulse of what is current and so the energy of the show ends up dipping up and down quite considerably."
610,610,Ought To Be Clowns,31/01/2017,mag9l,Years of Sunlight, Theatre503,"I learned to swim in Skelmersdale, known as Skem to anyone who has ever been there. A couple of miles from the village where I was born, the drive to the Nye Bevan Swimming Pool was always a fascinating one visually due to the whims of the 1960s town planners who designated the place a ‘new town’ – sheets of grey concrete dominated the architecture and the roads were full of roundabouts after roundabouts, barely a traffic light to be seen among the network of subways. It was also a strange feeling though, as it was crossing the invisible borderline from Woollyback territory (your more typical Lancastrian accent) into the land of the Scousers (the inimitable sound of Merseyside). I bring you this insight into the early years of Clowns because Years of Sunlight, a new play by Michael McLean, is set in Skem and whilst it had an undeniable nostalgic charge (I’m almost certainly the only reviewer there who got excited at the sight of the ‘Connie’, or Concourse shopping centre in a video clip), the play also had the unexpected result of making me think of the place in a new light. This particular ‘new town’ was designed to rehouse the overspill population from the poorer parts of Liverpool but the forced creation of new communities is rarely so simple as that, and it is this impact that McLean explores here, by following the thread of a 30 year friendship. As one of those transplanted families, Hazel and her young son Paul, who quickly becomes fast friends (blood brothers even…) with Emlyn, are faced with making their new lives here but McLean switches the timeline so that we begin in 2009 where we find the shattered pieces of those lives. Scene after scene then takes us backwards through the troubled relationship between this trio, dominated by the substance abuse that mars Emlyn’s life and reverberates powerfully through the others. This approach, directed by Amelia Sears, is very much a slow-burner but comes to pay huge emotional dividends as its pieces fall into place and hindsight gives dialogue an almost unbearable poignancy. Video interludes intersperse these scenes but could perhaps do more to really evoke the flow of time backwards, but Sears’ production rests on the considered intelligence and tenderness of its performances. Bryan Dick’s Emlyn and Mark Rice-Oxley’s Paul have the unenviable task of ageing back to 10 but do so with real conviction, carrying their innate characteristics with them – Dick always exploring the addictive tendencies of his rebel and chancer, Rice-Oxley’s desire to please – and recognition that he can’t always win – always a part of him. And Miranda Foster is terrific as Hazel, an Irishwoman always making the best of a bad lot, radiating maternal love even as she enables her adoptive son’s drugs habits."
611,611,Ought To Be Clowns,06/06/2013,Ian,The Amen Corner, National Theatre,"Reader, I ovated. It is a rare occasion indeed that I actually give a standing ovation, more often than not I think about it and don’t do it but just occasionally, one bears witness to something in a theatre that is just irresistibly, incandescently amazing that the only response is to get on one’s feet. For me, it was Marianne Jean-Baptiste’s simply extraordinary performance as Sister Margaret Alexander that beats powerfully at the heart of The Amen Corner, a revival of a 1965 American play by James Baldwin, that fills the Olivier Theatre with the glorious sound of the London Community Gospel Choir.  Jean-Baptiste’s Sister Margaret is the fiercely passionate leader of her local church in Harlem and living underneath with her sister Odessa and 18 year old son David, she leads her congregation with an iron fist of religious fervour. But trouble is brewing with discontent rumbling in the group of church elders who are looking for an opportunity to oust their leader and when her long estranged husband Luke turns up unexpectedly, they seize the moment as it turns out that their glorious leader may not be as blemish-free as she would have them believe. Spread over just three days and never leaving the two spaces of Ian MacNeil’s split-level set of church hall and apartment below, this could seem an intimate story but Rufus Norris’ production explodes it resplendently into a tale of epic proportions. Bringing in the near-constant sound of gospel music emphasises the strong sense of community that it, and the church, engenders for many African-Americans and this is contrasted sharply and excellently by the ferocious intensity of the family drama that unfolds downstairs. Margaret claimed to have been abandoned by her husband, a journey that led to the spiritual enlightenment that culminated in her taking on the role of pastor, but Luke’s arrival puts paid to that story. Lucian Msamati is highly engaging as the trombone-playing Luke, dancing his way back into the affections of his son – Eric Kofi Abrefa in fine form – and even his obdurate wife as he reminds her of the life she once led. And Jean-Baptiste proves herself a tragedian of the finest fettle as her certainties are stripped from her, the son she thought she had bound tightly to her strains for release, the congregation she has nurtured for so long forsakes her leadership. She is a hypnotic presence on the stage, drawing the eye with an almost leonine confidence as she berates and blesses, and utterly breaks the heart as the life she has constructed for herself begins to crumple.  She is supported by another fantastic performance from Sharon D Clarke as her sister Odessa, the epitome of compassionate grace as she supports her family – her wordless goodbye with David is a piece of heartbreaking wonder – and defends their reputation with her own brand of steely confidence, puncturing the pomposity of the conspirators who would accuse her of professional negligence. And they too are played to perfection by Jacqueline Boatswain, Donovan F Blackwood and the sprightly Cecilia Noble. There’s little of the Christian about the conniving ambition with which they pursue the usurping of Margaret but the way in which they silkily dress it up in well-meaning concern and guileless questions to win over the people smacks of many brands of organised religion to this day, more interested in defending their own power and the status quo than any true spirituality. Noble in particular nails the humour in the pious chastity of Sister Moore condemning behaviour of which she knows nothing about; Blackwood tracing the hypocritical unease of a female pastor leading the congregation knowing that she has “sinned” with a man, conveniently ignoring the fact that her son has played piano for the church for years."

613,613,Ought To Be Clowns,07/07/2015,mag9l,The House of Mirrors and Hearts, Arcola,"Despite sounding like a lost novel by Gabriel García Márquez, The House of Mirror and Hearts is actually something a lot closer to home, although no less rare, an original British musical. Written by Eamonn O’Dwyer and Rob Gilbert with music and lyrics by O’Dwyer too, it is the tale of a household torn apart by grief, where secrets have been held unspoken for nearly a decade, and resentments allowed to fester into toxic antipathy. The arrival of a nerdish lodger threatens to upset the fragile balance but it is far from clear if this will bring release to the Keanes or just another seven years bad luck and misery.  Developed by Perfect Pitch and co-produced with Aria Entertainment, it is clear that much love and care has gone into nurturing this piece of musical theatre into life, in all its challenging, angular beauty. O’Dwyer’s score has a pleasingly complex bent to it – those who judge musicals by their instant hummability will be left (mistakenly) disappointed – full of intensely unexpected harmonies and contrapuntal melodic lines that demand rapt attention and richly reward relistens (head to the Arcola’s website where 8 of the songs can be heard) – the music emerges as a thing of a jagged beauty. And such a confrontational score makes sense in light of the story. Gillian Kirkpatrick’s Anna seeks solace at the bottom of a bottle, her eldest daughter Laura has retreated into near-mute reproach in Grace Rowe’s sensitive performance, and her youngest Lily – a forthright Molly McGuire – is brashly acting out and lashing out at anyone around her. The presence of others in their home slowly forces them to confront the way that they’ve come to treat each other since a terrible event in their past but even Jamie Muscato’s charming haplessness struggles to unlock years of severe emotional repression. O’Dwyer and Gilbert show a nifty gift for drip-feeding information throughout the narrative so that the noir-ish feel of Ryan McBryde’s production is certainly well-earned, mirrored echoes of past and present haunt each scene to make it visually rich. Kirkpatrick is a staunch if occasionally amusingly sloshed central presence, reaching for some of the more extreme musical moments with real aplomb, Rowe and McGuire are achingly beautiful in both voice and performance as the struggling sisters and as their younger selves, Charlotte and Sophie Pourret-Wythe handle the not-inconsiderable demands of the roles with great professionalism."
614,614,Ought To Be Clowns,06/12/2017,Ian,Dear Brutus, Southwark Playhouse,"There’s a knack to finding the kind of long-neglected plays that respond well to a revival, as opposed to the ones that are deservedly collecting dust, and Ashley Cook’s Troupe seem to have nailed it. Making a name for themselves with the likes of Rodney Ackland’s After October and James Shirley’s The Cardinal, Troupe has now turned to JM Barrie – best known of course for sharing the same birthday as me, oh, and Peter Pan – to shine a light on the little-performed 1917 play Dear Brutus. It is undoubtedly a curious thing. It is set in a country house where the Puckish figure of its owner – Robin Hooper’s Lob – has invited a group of strangers for the weekend, with the intention of luring them into the enchanted wood that appears every midsummer to explore the lives that they might have led. A piece of magic-infused escapism that shifts tonally between whimsical frivolity and real psychological acuity, tear-jerking drama and comic romps and as such, can feel hard to pin down.  But director Jonathan O’Boyle does a fine job of doing just that, allowing his company the freedom to really play in the flights of fancy, contrasting strongly with the coiled springs of English reserve that we meet in the first act. From society ladies, depressed artists, couples missing a spark in their marriage, we explore the hopes and dreams that have long since slipped away mostly with a lightness of touch that the likes of Helen Bradbury, Edward Sayer and Bathsheba Piepe revel in with their deftly comic performances."

616,616,Ought To Be Clowns,22/11/2016,mag9l,Shakespeare Trilogy, Donmar at King’s Cross,"I must confess I hate it when critics roll their reviews of separate shows of a larger ‘event’ into one overarching piece – if you have to buy separate tickets to see the shows, then reviewers should write reviews for each one. Of course, it’s never quite as simple as that, it’s nice to have the space to talk about the whole as well as the constituent parts, but it should be noted that the Shakespeare Trilogy has been just as enjoyable, if not more so, in its individual segments as it was on the epic (and awkwardly timed) trilogy day.  I have seen all three of the shows before, and reviewed them – Julius Caesar, Henry IV, The Tempest  – so that’s my excuse for this composite piece. And for all that Phyllida Lloyd was uber-keen on having the official press response to the trilogy, I have to admit I didn’t see too much artistic merit in running them together. The only real common thread that emerges is Harriet Walter’s epic performance(s) as Hannah, the lifer who is the only character to recur in the prison setting that is used for all three shows. What you do get from the trilogy day though is a huge sense of occasion, and the undeniable truth of the significance of what has been achieved here. Unabashedly all-female productions of Shakespeare, shaking up a (male dominated) establishment that still can’t quite let these things happen without a range of think-pieces. And in collaboration with Clean Break, there’s been numerous opportunities for graduates of Clean Break’s education programme to perform alongside Walter and co, as in Jennifer Joseph who gives a brilliantly frank interview here."
617,617,Ought To Be Clowns,31/10/2012,Ian,Jumpy, Duke of York’s,"Not too much to say about this last minute revisit to Jumpy before it closed this weekend, aside from the predictability that I would end up there despite repeatedly assuring the world I wouldn’t. My original review from its run at the Royal Court can be read here and much of it still stands as my response was largely the same second time round and, rather pleasingly for a play in the West End, it was a sell-out. I was admittedly a little surprised when I first heard this would be one of the plays transferring to the Duke of York’s as whilst I found it good, I didn’t think it was necessarily that great (unlike many others). But holding onto the vast majority of its cast (just two replacements were needed), April De Angelis’ play maintained its essential quality with a stirring central performance from Tamsin Greig as a woman in the midst of a mid-life crisis as crises with her teenage daughter, tensions with her husband and losing her job all leave her reeling. De Angelis wraps all of this into a comedy though and so there’s a lightness to the whole affair which at once feels like its strength and its weakness. "
618,618,Ought To Be Clowns,21/12/2011,Ian,The Westbridge, Royal Court,"First things first, Ultz’s staging upstairs at the Royal Court for The Westbridge is a piece of craziness. Most of the seating is in the centre with chairs pointing in all different directions and stages around the edge of the theatre. I found it highly frustrating as the structure of the show with its mutliple short scenes meant there was constant moving around in our seats and much huffing and puffing from a midweek matinee audience who generally weren’t up for it. The play itself is very Royal Court Upstairs and I can totally see the logic in premiering it in Peckham as part of their Theatre Local initiative. I have to admit to turning down the chance to see it there several times as I was sure I didn’t want to see it. But I let people’s recommendations sway me and I’m glad I did, but I really do wish I’d seen it with a Peckham audience to see how it connected to a non-traditional audience (assuming it wasn’t full of regular Royal Court visitors going on the cheap!) Rachel De-lehay’s play emerges as one of the best evocations of the complexity of modern London in terms of culture, ethnicity, religion and generations. On a South London estate, a young couple try to make sense of their mixed heritage, both have white mothers but she has a Pakistani father and he has a black father. But tensions are never far away around them and when a young Asian girl is raped and a black teenager named as the chief suspect, long-held prejudices rise to the fore as the line between truth and fiction becomes increasingly blurred."
619,619,Ought To Be Clowns,10/08/2020,Ian,Alice – A Virtual Theme Park,,"There’s rarely a dearth of opportunities to visit Wonderland, Lewis Carroll’s ever-popular source material a frequent presence in theatres but with Alice – A Virtual Theme Park, there’s a very much 21st century take which works surprisingly well. And given Covid-19, it isn’t a play but rather a multiplatform, multiple choice experience. Let the Cheshire Cat guide you through your Zoom settings and listen to Leda Douglas’ inquisitive Alice as she takes us down the rabbit hole, and the scene is then set for an inspired, interactive and family-friendly journey with these familiar characters, effectively curated by Creation Theatre.  Zoe Seaton’s adaptation, aided by guest writer Charlotte Keatley, does an excellent job of blending technical innovation with live theatre, meaning that as audiences make their own way through the various vignettes, there’s plenty of amusing surprises at every turn and click of the button. Find yourself playing musical statues to the Macarena with the Queen of Hearts (a brilliantly malevolent Vera Chok) or dancing the Lobster Quadrille with the March Hare. Design a baby hedgehog so you can join in with hedgehog croquet and get wrapped up in the thrilling courtroom drama when those jam tarts go missing…"
620,620,Ought To Be Clowns,01/02/2011,Ian,Clybourne Park, Wyndham’s,"Maintaining an excellent record of transfers for the Royal Court, Bruce Norris’ Clybourne Park is the latest play to make the leap from Sloane Square to the West End, in this case the Wyndham’s Theatre. Robert Innes Hopkins’ design seems to have transferred almost exactly as it was at the Royal Court, seemingly at the same size and still undergoing such a great transformation in the interval. All but two of the original cast have transferred with the show, directed by Dominic Cooke, which has already won Best Show plaudits from the Evening Standard, South Bank Sky Arts and the Critics Circle and looks set to continue that success. I saw the show early in its run at the Royal Court and though not originally intending to revisit the show, the opportunity arose and I became quite intrigued by the idea of seeing the production again in a new home. The play takes a dual look at racial prejudice in America, starting in 1959 as a white family try to sell their house in a white neighbourhood to a black family despite pressure from the locals, then switching to 2009 where the tables are turned as the demographic of the area has switched completely and it is the black community resisting the ideas of a white couple who want to buy the same house. It looks at how people rarely say exactly what they mean, especially where race is concerned and though things would seem to have improved by 2009, the events of the second half show us that that progress could be seen to be quite superficial. Sophie Thompson stood out for me once again with a simply sensational first half performance which gained even more depth for me, now having the advance knowledge of the reasons for her behaviour. She brings a powerful emotional resonance anyway to the so-very-brittle Bev, a housewife struggling do to the right thing in the minefield of both the changing racial and sexual politics of the time. And I’d forgotten just how funny her wise-cracking lawyer is, a much smaller part for the second half but almost just as impactful. Stuart McQuarrie, replacing Steffan Rhodri, was superb at evoking both the simmering suppressed rage of Russ and the affability of chatty workman Dan, suggesting more of the slothful nature of the former and thereby heightening the threat felt by him as he snaps. Stephen Campbell Moore had the slightly trickier job of stepping in at the last minute for Jason Watkins, the original replacement for Martin Freeman, who had to withdraw from the production for family reasons. His first half performance isn’t quite as natural as it needs to be yet, suffering a little by comparison to Freeman’s ease, one never quite forgets he’s ‘acting’ as Karl but this should come with time and he is excellent as Steve, who pushes the situation further than it can bear with his unleashing of a torrent of dodgy jokes, both characters incredibly stubborn in their own way. Lorna Brown’s excruciatingly passive-aggressive Lena, Sam Spruell’s heartily inquisitive Jim and Sarah Goldberg’s overly PC and pregnant Lindsey were other excellent performances it was nice to revisit but this is a pleasingly tight ensemble who connect brilliantly in both configurations."
621,621,Ought To Be Clowns,01/09/2011,Ian,Korczak, YMT at Rose Kingston,"The true life story of Janusz Korczak a Polish Jew who protected some 200 children from some of the worst horrors of the Second World War may not seem a likely subject for a piece of musical theatre but strange as it may seem, it works with a devastating precision. It was written in 1998 for youth theatre groups by Nick Stimson (book and lyrics) who also directs here and Chris Williams (music) but this version is presented here by Youth Music Theatre – the UK’s leading national music theatre company for young people – at the Rose Theatre in Kingston. In Liz Cooke’s stark, wire-caged design with occasional shots of video, the story moves from the orphanage Korczak set up in the Polish countryside, inspired by those he saw in England, where he attempts to shield the children from the war that is ripping their country apart, to the Warsaw ghetto where they are eventually shipped off to as the Nazis’ Jewish solution took hold. But rather than focus on the sadness and horror, the writers tell the stories of these children, the various ways in which they react to the challenges posed to their everyday lives and getting on with the business of growing up, learning about love, humanity and responsibility even as the shadows grow ever darker. Through the teeming masses, there’s a cast of over 40, shards of these stories are illuminated which in turns lay the basis for future action. And this is where the production excels in creating believable characters in such short spans of time and in whose fates we consequently are thoroughly invested. The vaudeville rough-and-tumble of boys Bula and Izak, Harry Child and Ross Munro respectively, takes a deadly serious turn as they are both forced to grow up far too quickly in the harsh world once they make their escape; the delicate friendship between Hannah Thompson’s troubled Gienia and Sophie Garner’s big-sisterly Malgorzata carried through to a simply heart-breaking conclusion. All four of these performers did fantastic jobs, displaying impressive depth to portray the quandaries they all find themselves in, but I do have to say that I thought Hannah Thompson was just exceptional, her vocal control and intensity of performance belying her youth. Other sub-plots weren’t quite as affecting: the love triangle, apparently straight out of Les Mis but soundtracked by Sondheim, didn’t really work without a fuller context though Joel Fisher and Lindsay Atherton did well to convince as the young lovers torn apart by religion. And the motif of the bird in captivity was a little overdone for me, though boy soprano Jo Moore sang gorgeously as Staszek. Holding this disparate group together is the sole adult, Peter Straker’s Janusz Korczak, a kindly father figure for all, Jews and Catholics alike, but played with enough steely edges and irascibility to ensure that this is no simple saint-like lionisation but the portrayal of an extremely good man, flaws and all. Piera Van der Wiel did well to bring a mature bearing to her Madame Stefa too. Jon Laird’s 12-person band played Chris Williams’ score proficiently, taking in the aforementioned musical nods to Sondheim and Les Mis but coming into their own for the rousing hymn-like anthem about finding a new country. The score is a little repetitive in places but I rather enjoyed the stirring reprises as the tunes were mostly very strong. Special mention must go to Yoael Loewenstein’s movement too, director Stimson conjuring some beautiful moments: one stunning pre-echo sequence as the children go to sleep, an evocative telling of the Pied Piper of Hamelin – itself a chilling clue – and later a neat swift shift from beggar-town to smoky jazz club, both working extremely well. As with any show, there were a few teething problems, undermiking masked some of the singing and as ever in a company like this, the disparity in levels of training was exposed every so often. But on two weeks rehearsal, the overall achievement was simply superb and used the space of the Rose Theatre, not one I am particularly fond of, to great effect. Not knowing the story beforehand, I clung tightly onto my naïve hope throughout that a Hollywood miracle would occur but the brutality of the story – told with chilling simplicity which never sensationalises the unfolding horror and tragedy – was unrelenting, though balanced by the purity of its message. The final moment of revelation was one of the most heart-breakingly affecting moments I have seen in a theatre this year – highly recommended. On a final, related, note, Korczak is yet another example of the rich and vast potential of musical theatre as a dramatic form that people really ought to open their minds to. It is no secret that I am a massive fan of musicals in all their varied glory but this is so far from the stereotypical view of musicals – in a similar vein to the recentThe Hired Man, Bernarda Alba, Parade or even London Road – that I really wish something could be done to force a major reappraisal in the way people view musicals. The music here provides a perfect conduit for the children to show their varied feeling en masse and allows for a depth of expressively emotional impact that just wouldn’t be the same in the spoken word. This then adds to its value as a historical document, its powerfully affecting message of something that shouldn’t be sugar-coated or forgotten which hopefully will ensure its enduring legacy: something the jingoistic Churchill-centric Three Days in May, another WWII play I saw this week in one of those quirks of the booking diary, would have done well to remember."
622,622,Ought To Be Clowns,28/02/2020,Ian,Don’t Talk To Strangers, VAULT Festival,"What record would you have fired into space as a perpetual record of life on Earth for any passing extraterrestrials to find? The Queen of the Night (Mozart or Whitney, take your pick)? Pachelbel’s Canon in D? The Macarena? The programme notes for Hot Cousin’s show Don’t Talk To Strangers (ooh, maybe some Chaka Khan, or Prince too…) inform you that they don’t want to tell you anything about the show before it starts and of course, they kinda know what they’re talking about. So if you’re feeling bold, I’d say take a chance, stop reading now and book a ticket to see what they can do with a glitter ball, a loop pedal, a shiny pink cloak and infinite modes of communication.  For those who are persevering, the thrust of this formally inventive and philosophically probing show offers up one of the more fascinating hours I’ve spent at this year’s VAULT Festival. Taking Carl Sagan’s Golden Record – ostensibly a record of all humanity – as its starting point, it asks the question whether such an enterprise could ever work, and whether such a message could ever hope to encapsulate any amount of the diversity of humankind."

624,624,Ought To Be Clowns,27/01/2020,Ian,9 to 5 The Musical, Savoy Theatre,"The pictures above should give you an indication as to who the real star of 9 to 5 The Musical is, no matter how red the trunks (or surprisingly long the legs) of David Hasselhoff. I first saw this cinematic adaptation in 2012 on its UK tour and loved Bonnie Langford’s performance so much it ranked in that year’s best. So her return to the show in its West End debut last year was great to behold (even if it didn’t quite tempt me along to see it again). It’s a curious one, Patricia Resnick’s adaptation of her own film sprinkles the story with the rhinestone glitter of Dolly Parton’s songbook, far beyond the iconic title track and is possessed of a huge spirit of fun. But the tale itself, of the struggle for women’s equality in the workplace, demands a little more gravity than it ultimately gets here. How seriously are we meant to take sexual harassment when it is accompanied by the Colgate smile and eye twinkle of the Hoff. It’s a tension that is never resolved in the show but from the start, you pretty much know it is never even going to try. As Parton’s gleaming image pops up on a screen to introduce the musical, its particular mood is set and a level of impressively energetic fun from Jeff Calhoun’s direction and Lisa Stevens’ choreography is imposed. And the charm offensive does prove effective, it is all too easy, and somewhat welcome, to be swept along in the rush."
625,625,Ought To Be Clowns,25/01/2010,Ian,Rope, Almeida  with Q+A,"“People argue about the queerest things nowadays” Perhaps an odd choice for a festive show, Rope at the Almeida Theatre is a dark tale of murder, abusive relationships and a dinner party (which I guess is what Christmas is about for some people…) Two Oxford students, Brandon and Granillo murder a third for the existential thrill of committing the ‘perfect murder’, they then invite people, including the dead boy’s father, round for supper, which is served on the chest where the body is stashed. Only one guest begins to suspect something is amiss, Rupert Cadell, a WWI veteran now a world-weary Nietzschean and over the course of the evening, the men try to argue the case for their intellectual superiority and play the dangerous game of trying to get away with murder. The most arresting thing about this production upon entering the theatre is that it is presented in the round. This is a first for the Almeida and it is highly effective. It gives the real sense of being in the room with the protagonists and also has the visually pleasing effect of placing the chest in the centre of the action, both physically and metaphorically. This worked beautifully in the scenes which had several of the characters on stage, but I felt that when there was just two or three of them, more could have been done to utilise this format: the final face-off scene in particular was very static and played as if on a normal stage. This worked fine for us in our central seats but people to the side would have just seen the back of one or other of the main characters for the final 20 minutes of the play. Bertie Carvel’s Rupert is a fascinating creation: a wounded creature, overflowing with sardonic wit and a razor-sharp mind, but beneath it all the sense of an aching sadness that is barely concealed. And I found it a little surprising that the play actually became about his journey: as he slowly uncovers the truth of the evening’s events, he comes to realise that his world-view, coloured horribly by his wartime experiences which he viewed as murder, is perhaps skewed and that what he is witnessing is in fact what murder really is. The part is played with such care and devotion by Carvel, it really is a sight to behold. Blake Ritson is also excellent as the cunning, manipulative Brandon whose relationship with Granillo is never clearly spelt out (they’ve been a gay couple in previous productions) but it is clear he is the driving force behind events. Alex Waldmann as Granillo suffered a little bit with a less appealing part, already weighed down with the consequences at the outset and given to hysteric outbursts, I felt like there could have been more to him than just fluster. Elsewhere Henry Lloyd-Hughes and Phoebe Waller-Bridge provided some great comic relief as the somewhat vacuous other guests at the dinner party. Having booked for the show with the Q+A session at the end was also highly illuminating. It was nice to see the actors talking about the processes behind their choices, Waldmann, Ritson and above all Carvel were all very impressive and whilst Lloyd-Hughes may have played it for laughs rather than contributing on an intellectual level, he was goofily charming. It was particularly interesting to hear that Brandon and Granillo are not actually described as being gay anywhere in the text or stage directions and that the ambiguity bemoaned by certain members of the press is actually the original reading of the text. And their tales of reactions to the first scene being played in the dark were genius, someone actually used an i-Phone to help them see, and they’ve been playing with the temperature controls to ensure people didn’t drift off to sleep! Just a couple of weeks of this run remain and it is sold out, but day seats are available for £15 in person or by phone. Rope is a much more engaging look at inter-war ennui amongst the privileged than the execrable Pains of Youth and a great chance to see how familiar theatrical spaces can be reconfigured (Measure for Measure will apparently not be in the round) but something was a bit lacking for me in the end (if not for my colleague!)."
626,626,Ought To Be Clowns,17/02/2011,Ian,Penelope, Hampstead Theatre,"Enda Walsh’s Penelope is a modern reimagining and refocusing of Homer’s Odyssey, taking as its main subject the wife of Odysseus who, whilst waiting for her husband to return, was entertained by over 100 suitors whom she kept at bay for over 20 years. Walsh picks up the story on the day before Odysseus returns, with the last four remaining men kept in a disused swimming pool next to Penelope’s palatial home, desperate for one last chance to win her hand. Densely poetic, the language is chillingly beautiful at times, none more so than with Niall Buggy’s hoarsely intonated speech about the ‘real’ world. Each actor though is given the opportunity to shine as they each plead for Penelope’s hand, all too aware of the fast-approaching consequences of Odysseus’ return and unable to hide the desperation they all feel. Walsh depicts the senselessness of pursuing competition recklessly to the end, taking aim at perceived notions of masculinity and by extension, the state of Ireland today. But such a focus on the enigmatically multi-layered text became a little wearing, even over the relatively short running time, it just got a bit too relentless and I longed for more of a dramatic impetus, for something to happen even it was just more of the superb ensemble work with its beautifully detailed and amusing interactions: the little mime sequence was just hilarious. And my wish was indeed granted with a dizzyingly frantic quick-change show from the fearless Karl Shiels, ripping through famous lovers from history and a breathlessly intense finale. Mikel Murfi’s production is remarkable in the performances it has teased out here and Sabine Dargent’s set fits in perfectly, end-on at the Hampstead, suggesting neatly the Beckettian desolation that lies at the heart of the play. Altogether it was impressively unique, not immediately to my taste in its wilful opaqueness but thought-provoking nonetheless and a play which I think would bear repeated re-readings – the playtext programme is just £3 and probably well worth it. I disagree. It was terrible. The worst play I've ever seen and I've seen a LOT. I enjoyed it very much – but agree that it was tiring to watch. Would definitely reward a second viewing. Why terrible, o Anonymous?? I have been laughing to myself about the sausage and the blow torch all day. But them I am a bit of a fan of pretentious theatre."
627,627,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2015,mag9l,Eventide, Arcola,"With his second play Eventide, one gets a sense of what the Barney Norris-verse is about. As with the aching splendour of last year’s Visitors, we’re in rural England and focusing on the smaller details of the big picture, the individual lives that make up a society that is struggling to keep pace with the changing world. An elegant three-hander played out over two key encounters a year apart, Alice Hamilton’s production is full of subtleties and subtly powerful acting that does real justice to Norris’ emerging voice as a playwright of real note. In the pub garden of an establishment in deepest Hampshire, three lonely souls share their sorrows, specifically in one case as it is the day of a funeral but also more generally as the rural economy on which they all depend has become increasingly depressed, the world of farming very much no longer what it used to be. Pub landlord John is throwing in the towel and selling to a chain, church organist Liz is losing money foot over pedal as local gigs are so thin on the ground and Mark, whose best friend’s funeral it is, can’t go because a rare job offer – as painful as it is – has come up. Norris’ writing has poignancy threaded through its every line. He excels in portraits of the everyday, unpicking the seemingly mundane and exposing the complex layers that make us all up, the struggles to reconcile difficult decisions, the pain that lies behind many a brave face, the strength it takes to get up for one more day in a world that’s getting harder and harder to live in. Hamilton understands this fully and so what could have been static in less sure hands becomes intricately detailed and beautiful to behold."
628,628,Ought To Be Clowns,16/10/2016,mag9l,27, Cockpit,"If only the public were so gullible… New rock musical 27 has nearly completed a substantial run at the Cockpit Theatre so I took my time to see it, knowing that many a show that has described itself as a rock musical has proven not to be my cup of tea. And thus it turned out with Sam Cassidy and Matt Wills’ 27, a mishmash of classical and modern myths that ends up something of an unholy mess. At the forefront, just about, is the story of Orpheus, reinterpreted here for the modern world as wannabe rocker Jason (with a band called the Argonauts…) who does a Faustian deal with the devil for instant fame (see what I mean about those influences…) but ends up chasing through the underworld to rescue his girlfriend who has succumbed to a drug overdose.  Jason, who has renamed himself Orpheus btw, is 27 at this point, which just happens to be the age Jimmy Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison and Amy Winehouse all were when they died, ultimately an uncomfortable contemporary allusion (and unnecessary narrative spoiler). Throw in a raft of random Shakespearean allusions, let Medusa pop in for a bit and stick in a pre-recorded rock track, and there you have 27. The book is thus laboured and lazy, mistaking the incorporation of these references for depth instead of establishing its own story. Is Orpheus a genuine musical talent, or just a record label puppet? We never know (or really care). Equally, there’s little effort to make us like him as a musician as he only gets narrative songs rather than performance numbers, despite committed work from Greg Oliver’s Orpheus and Ryan Gibb and Jack Donnelly as his personable bandmates."
629,629,Ought To Be Clowns,04/10/2013,Ian,Hidden in the Sand, Trafalgar Studios,"The Turkish invasion of Cyprus may seem like an unlikely backdrop for a love story but in James Phillips’ self-directed Hidden in the Sand, it serves well as the catalyst for an emotional personal odyssey that stretches across Europe and over decades. Alexandra Chrysostomou’s happy life in the northern Cypriot port of Famagusta was ripped from her when the Turks invaded – there was barely time to collect a few precious belongings before fleeing with her sister Eleni, at a stroke reduced to the level of refugee. Eventually constructing a new life for herself in London, running a shop and subsisting on the memories of love and home, the prospect of a new relationship forces her to confront some of the more painful aspects of the past. Sally Dexter’s Alexandra and Scott Handy as new beau Jonathan trace the nervous steps of a new relationship beautifully. As more mature souls, already bruised by life, their hesitant flirtation and subsequent opening up to one another is sensitively, superbly drawn. Her tempestuous Mediterranean spirit is almost too large for life, his linen-clad quietness the perfect foil to her broccoli-cooking ways, but she can’t escape the shadows of the version of the past that she has erected for herself, to protect herself, to delude herself into thinking the way things were was the way she wanted them to be. On her own she might get away with it, but the presence of her photo-journalist niece and indeed Jonathan means that reality can’t be escaped. The way in which Phillips unwinds the story is well done, constantly challenging what we believe to be fact and there’s an interesting sub-plot involving Daphne Alexander’s war photographer Sophia, questioning the nature and the artifice of photo-journalism. And I genuinely found the play fascinating when talking about what happened in Cyprus, something so rarely spoken of these days, the conflict too easily consigned to history even as hundreds of men remain unaccounted for, the fate of one of those proving particularly pertinent here, especially with the arrival of estranged sister Eleni, a far-too-brief cameo from the excellent Yolanda Vazquez."
630,630,Ought To Be Clowns,08/09/2016,mag9l,Vanities – The Musical, Trafalgar Studios 2,"In some ways, you can see why Vanities: the Musical has taken its time to make its way over the ocean since its 2008 premiere. Based on a 1976 play by Jack Heifner which follows the friendship of three young women from Texas over ten years – and for its time, a daring look at the changing role of women in society – Heifner’s book for the musical extends the story to a fourth act and by at least another decade, but it is unevenly plotted and rather superficial. The beauty of Racky Plews’ production for Aria Entertainment though is that it takes all of this in its stride and in some pitch-perfect casting in the form of Lizzy Connolly, Ashleigh Gray and Lauren Samuels, imbues the material with a real sense of heart. So as Joanne, Kathy and Mary move from high school to college, to the personal and professional lives that they dreamed of and by which they are taken by surprise, we’re totally drawn in by their performances. Connolly’s wannabe Southern belle Joanne is a comic delight as she drawls through a raft of cracking one-liners, Gray’s control freak Kathy feels like the emotional heart of the show as the one who seems to be sideswiped most by the reality of life, and Samuels’ free-spirit-in-the-making Mary transforms remarkably in the liberation of the 70s. And all three exhibit a supreme vocal confidence which makes a virtue of the intimacy of the Trafalgar Studios’ intimate second space."

632,632,Ought To Be Clowns,24/10/2016,mag9l,The Million Pound Heist, Enigma Quests,"As the hunger for escape-the-room games increases, so too does the ingenuity of those who come up with these activities, tweaking the format a little every time so that we keep on coming back for more. One of the more ambitious of these companies are Enigma Quests, proprietors of the Harry Potter-inspired School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and newly opened game The Million Pound Heist.  And as the name suggests, The Million Pound Heist sees your group take on the role of thieves and rather than escaping the room per se, your job is to break into the vaults of an international art crime syndicate. This you do by solving a series of increasingly fiendish challenges, testing your ingenuity, resourcefulness and downright lateral thinking techniques to make your way through a series of rooms towards the loot. I can’t reveal too much more about the specific nature of The Million Pound Heist as that would give the game away now, wouldn’t it, but I can say that our team had a great evening as burglars. Having done a couple of these kind of games together definitely helps with getting into the mindset of finding out what to do next in a room that looks empty (here’s a hint, they’re never empty!) and it is endlessly fascinating to see the way your team acts and interacts when faced with any number of challenges. To be sure, it’s not the cheapest thing to do, but it is a hell of a lot of good fun and given how the final challenge plays out, you have the chance to make it onto the leaderboard but only if you can convert the full currency of your team’s abilities…"
633,633,Ought To Be Clowns,03/02/2017,mag9l,What’s In A Name?, Birmingham REP,"Its rather lazy, and stereotypical, approach to laughing at the gays aside, there’s a quite a lot to enjoy here in the Birmingham REP’s production of the award-winning French play What’s In A Name?. Written by Matthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de la Patellière, Le Prénom has been widely translated and produced, as well as receiving a film adaptation, but this version translated by Jeremy Sams for Just for Laughs Theatricals, marks the play’s British premiere. Set in the Peckham apartment of Peter and Elizabeth (of course I went to Birmingham to see a play set 10 minutes from my flat!), the sharp comedy revolves around that staple of many a dramatist – the awkward dinner party. The hosts have invited her brother and his best friend Vincent and his heavily pregnant wife Anna, plus their ‘confirmed bachelor’ friend Carl, and over a Moroccan buffet and bottles of Chateau Margaux 1985, all manner of uncomfortable truths are revealed. Events are triggered by the rich and boorish Vincent announcing the name of his forthcoming son, something that weighs heavier than usual in these alt-right times, sparking an intellectual conversation which takes an interesting look at freedom of expression and acceptable morality. But from here, long-held grudges, rivalries and recriminations and any number of home truths are fired by and at all five of the guests, not a one remaining unscathed. And it is here that the level varies a bit, Sams’ translation erring towards sub-sitcom levels as they’re all busy scoring cheap points off each other. At times it works, at times it doesn’t – Peter (Jamie Glover) and Elizabeth’s (Sarah Hadland) effortful liberal identity is perfectly encapsulated in a daughter named Gooseberry, so slagging them them off as ‘Guardian readers’ feels lazy, if not downright redundant. The writing may be fast and frantic but it is also flimsy."
634,634,Ought To Be Clowns,25/07/2018,Ian,Dusty, Lowry / Aspects of Love,"Does the world really need another Dusty Springfield musical? I avoided the car crash at the Charing Cross a few years back, and wish I had avoided Son of a Preacher Man last year. But still they come and now we have Dusty the Musical which at least boasts a better pedigree than most, with Jonathan Harvey writing, Maria Friedman directing and Katherine Kingsley starring. And with that level of quality, particularly from the mega-wattage of Kingsley’s titanic performance, it certainly emerges as the best of the bunch, relatively speaking. It is far from a great show though, its book weighed down with the tension between meticulously researched facts and figures and the greater freedom that comes from invented characters who allow story to flow. If it is to make it into the West End, more tinkering needed and Kingsley locked down."
635,635,Ought To Be Clowns,25/04/2010,Ian,Macbeth, Shakespeare’s Globe,"Opening the 2010 Kings and Rogues season at Shakespeare’s Globe on the South Bank is Lucy Bailey’s production of Macbeth. Fans of the Scottish play are being well-served this year: Cheek By Jowl may now have left the Barbican but you can catch them again in Brighton in May, the Open Air Theatre will be running a re-imagined for kids version in July or you can witness this decidedly less family-friendly production in the Globe. Katrina Lindsay’s design has clearly taken the circular shape of the theatre into consideration and used the circles of hell in Dante’s Inferno as the main inspiration. The Yard is mostly covered with a canopy, with holes for the groundlings to poke their heads through, representing the frozen sinners trapped in the underworld, and it is also populated with the occasional bloodsoaked writhing tortured soul popping up. I can’t comment on how comfortable or otherwise it was, but there’s plenty of room outside of the canopy if you’re not too sure about it: it did look fun though. The weird sisters therefore are the guardians of this final Hell and flow in and out of there onto the stage, trying to drag as many people down with them. And lordy don’t they get a lot of bodies. This is a production very much attuned to and unafraid of just how much death is contained within Shakespeare’s text: I don’t think I’ve ever seen Macduff’s family dispatched so brutally, both Duncan’s and Lady Macbeth’s bodies are paraded onstage, it’s all very bloody and gruesome and huge amounts of fun. Casting the central couple a bit younger than one might have expected in the shape of hot things Elliot Cowan and Laura Rogers actually works surprisingly well. Their’s is a passionate, impetuous relationship, indeed the first time we see them together, they literally rip the clothes off each other and whilst a small thing, it cleverly roots their marriage as something real. Cowan’s “Tomorrow, and tomorrow…” was particularly heartbreaking as a result of this and throughout the play he did extremely well in resolving my doubts about whether I could deal with a sexy Macbeth (and by God is he hot, if looking evermore like Heath Ledger!). Laura Rogers also does well as a flirtatious Lady Macbeth, able to use her feminine wiles to win over most anyone. And the sense of limitless ambition fits quite neatly with a younger couple, not yet fully cognisant of the dangers of the reckless pursuit of power. Elsewhere Christian Bradley’s Banquo impressed, especially with a great entrance into the feast and I just loved the weird sisters, Simone Kirby, Karen Anderson and Janet Fullerlove: they look like a twisted set of Russian dolls with their different heights and possessed of a palpable sense of malevolence in their meddling, never far from the stage or the action. Costumes were nice enough, all blacks and gunmetal greys with just the weird sisters’ crimson outfits adding a splash of colour to proceedings. There’s the usual good use of music, sackbuts, didgeridoos and multiple bagpipes creating a discordant tense atmosphere, but I also liked the use of singing, especially in creating the sense of genuine camaraderie between the soldiers, but also in a early devotional chant with Duncan. But it is the rest of the staging which I found most effective. Chains and hanging baskets of fire circle round and the back of the stage is draped in billowing black satin with a black net curtain also sometimes circling the stage, echoing the influences of Dante. The curtain sometimes serves as a room divider, sometime as a veil between this world and the underworld of the Yard, either way it is clear that whilst this may be Scotland, it’s really just another circle of hell. The only weakness for me is in the sagging of the pace during the third quarter of the play, as I’ve never been a fan of Malcolm and Macduff’s extended scene and the performances here did little to change my mind. This was a second preview, so I would imagine that the whole half will become tighter, but I fear I will never really ‘get’ that scene or see the need for its length. Otherwise, this is a highly entertaining, if blood-soaked production which augurs well for the season ahead, and not just because Mr Cowan whips his shirt off, honest! I found the canopy not too uncomfortable at all. There's enough give for you to be able to redistribute your weight as the evening goes on, and it was ever so nice to have the little extra warmth offered on a chilly evening such as last Friday! Agreed on all comments on Cowan; he's a lot like a sexy manly (lively) Heath Ledger, and I'm glad to hear someone else sees it too! (Let's be fair – it is totally worth seeing just for Cowan's most excellent shirtless scenes. Luckily, said scenes are tethered to an excellent production as well! XD) Also agreed on the Witches; did you notice they were wearing tattered and torn Steward tunics as part of their costume, thus adding further to the idea that the Globe is Hell and they're in charge? :3 Also agreed that the only real downfall is pacing. It's the sort of thing I feel bad bringing up, because it will surely resolve itself as the cast continue performing in front of audiences, but knowing that it will inevitably tighten up didn't stop it feeling a little draggy on occasion. Nice review! 😉 (I should probably point out that a few Facebook users have commented on the canopy being uncomfortable for them, but as a veteran Globe-visitor, I'm fairly firm in my view that it's no less comfortable than being a standard canopy-free groundling. Also helps keep taller audience members tethered in one place, instead of them being free to parade back and forth in front of you. I advise people with long hair to go for a reasonably high ponytail, and avoid wearing clothing with collars unless you want to feel a little like a dog in a lampshade, trying desperately to get the things around your neck to feel a little less alien and failing dismally. XD) On the one hand pacing can be tightened up for sure, but for me, that third quarter is just deadly! Even in the Cheek by Jowl version which was two hours without interval, my eyes started to droop as soon as Malcolm and Macduff started talking. Thanks for your comments though. I love the tidbits about the witches' costumes! I bet you were as disappointed as I was with Lady M's dresses though…! Aren't the programmes shiny and pretty! Fleance stands on the throne, Macbeth playfully puts the crown on his head, The boy forgets to return it and Macbeth calls him back and jokingly takes it from him, Nice touches by the director, I thought! Yes, programmes are lovely. I hope all the ones this year are similiar then I will collect a set."
636,636,Ought To Be Clowns,26/09/2013,Ian,Ghosts, Rose Theatre Kingston,"London has long thrived on its paranormal industry – spooky tours, famous cemeteries, Jack the Ripper and his ilk and now in its theatres, a double helping of Ghosts, albeit of Ibsen’s variety. Richard Eyre will direct his own version for the Almeida which opens next week but sneaking ahead is Stephen Unwin’s adaptation, also self-directed, for the Rose Theatre, Kingston. A co-production with English Touring Theatre, it marks the twentieth anniversary of that company but perhaps more significantly, it will be Unwin’s final production at the Rose where he has served as Artistic Director for six years. He has a clear affinity for the Norwegian playwright – Ghosts is the second translation Unwin has written and the seventh of his plays that he has directed and upping the authenticity ante, the look of the show has taken direct inspiration from the stage designs of Edvard Munch, who designed a production in Berlin in 1906 and which have never been seen since. And the result is an extremely classy piece of theatre, one which coils up the intensity of its acting for an incendiary final act but sometimes feels like it is taking an age to get there. Unwin calls it “one of the greatest plays of world drama” in the programme yet arguably the potency of its power to shock is not one that has lasted. Ibsen uses syphilis as a metaphor for moral hypocrisy and social decay, something that scandalised contemporary society, as venerable widow Mrs Alving tries everything she can to avoid the sins of the father being paid onto her son Osvald as we discover that her late husband was a pox-ridden, philandering scoundrel. But her efforts are in vain as fate firmly aligns itself against the Alvings with the bleakest of consequences. With venereal disease no longer quite the taboo it once was, the focus flips onto the domestic tragedy of Osvald, and his tangled relationships with his too-close mother and the maid Regine, to whom he has a connection far closer than ever imagined. But Ibsen never really fleshes the character out enough, nor indeed Unwin in his version, to draw us into the tragic whirlpool of which he is the centre and despite his best efforts, Mark Quartley can’t quite overcome this emotional distance to connect with the others, or indeed the audience. Kelly Hunter makes for a strikingly intense Mrs Alving though, her eyes burning with the injustice of the world even she composes her frame into acceptably demure postures for the highly hypocritical Pastor Manders whose benedictions and advice she craves, even though it is destructively mistaken and rooted in their shared past. Patrick Drury perfectly captures the ostentatious pomposity of the man, visibly withdrawing from any potential contact with a woman, but again there’s little sense that any romantic attachment had ever existed between the pair. "
637,637,Ought To Be Clowns,31/08/2013,Ian,I’m With The Band, St James Theatre,"Between recent plays on Wikileaks and Scottish independence at this year’s Edinburgh festival, Welsh playwright Tim Price has shown himself to be utterly unafraid of tackling some of the more pressing topical subjects of our time. The well-received Radicalisation of Bradley Manning has finished for now but I’m With The Band has transferred to the St James Theatre for a two week run. Four piece indie-rock band The Union are riding high on critical and commercial success but a devastating piece of news about their finances leaves them millions in the red and prompts the departure of their lead guitarist Barry. With the original structure broken, the remaining members have to recalibrate and decide what, if any, future remains. That the key creative relationship in the band is between the Caledonian Barry and the English keyboard player Damien adds piquancy, setting up this allegorical study of what the effects of Scottish independence might be. But he cleverly expands the picture to include Welsh bassist Gruff and Ulsterman Aaron on drums, who has an additional tortured relationship with Irish girlfriend Sinead with whom he shares a house which is divided by a chalk line they never cross, reminding us all that though the focus may be nearly exclusively Anglo-Scottish, there are two more countries involved in the wider question of separation. It’s a fascinating and genuinely thought-provoking premise but one which is only fitfully served by the play. Price doesn’t advance much beyond the set-up in terms of dramatic characterisation or more crucially, with regards to what might have motivated such momentous decisions. It doesn’t really delve into the complexities of the debate, or convince us of the depth of the relationship which is sundered, and the implications of such a divorce with English ambition left unchecked feel heavy-handed and over-emphatically portrayed in a trying penultimate scene."
638,638,Ought To Be Clowns,18/07/2014,mag9l,Annie Get Your Gun, Churchill Bromley,"Blessed with one of the almighty scores of Broadway history, you’d think that productions of Annie Get Your Gun would be the simplest of gimmes but given that it is very much a piece of writing of its time, it’s not quite as easy as that (as I discovered recently in seeing Carousel for the first time). The gender politics therein are dubious at best and the treatment of Native Americans also speaks of severely outdated attitudes, so directors are faced with something of a conundrum. The Young Vic just went bizarre with it back in 2009 and now a major UK touring production by Ian Talbot opts for the ‘play within a play’ route, the framing device often used in The Taming of the Shrew to address similarly thorny issues.  Elements of the show have also been removed and tinkered to further redress the gender balance but in all honesty it feels like a step too far – applying both of these patches detracts from their intentions. If it is a bit of meta-theatre, then surely it can just be played as is, as we know not to take it seriously; or if we’re reinventing the story for 21st century eyes, then just rewrite it wholesale. Instead we’re left with something which never really achieves either aspect on a dramatic level, something exacerbated by the limitations of a touring set design. Fortunately, the production sounds like a dream with a superb orchestra though and has some cracking performances in it from a cast who deliver the utterly timeless score by Irving Berlin with all the panache it deserves."
639,639,Ought To Be Clowns,28/02/2014,mag9l,Smallholding, Soho Theatre,"I’ve enjoyed previous plays by Chris Dunkley so when the invitation to see Smallholding, a co-production between HighTide and the Nuffield, came my way, I took the chance to make my first ever visit to Southampton (via a matinée in Salisbury of course) where I had a great time, ranking the play 22nd out of the 300 odd I saw last year. Spurred on by its success, the production has now resurfaced in the sweltering heat of the Soho Upstairs, where the bruising intimacy of this two-hander has only gained power.  After a rocky time of it, Andy and Jen have moved back to the East Northamptonshire village of their youth and taken on a small farm, a smallholding where they intend to make a new life, rearing pigs and growing parsnips and garlic. It’s difficult to outrun demons though and the rural isolation presents its own set of challenges – Smallholding is a story about how we sometimes grip so tightly onto the things we deem most precious to us, we don’t notice them shattering in our hands.  The writing of the central relationship is beautifully done – full of naturalistic low-key humour and the tender moments that characterise the thrill of moving to a new home. Matti Houghton turns in an exceptional performance as Jen, whose patient tolerance and hopeful pragmatism is a delight to behold whereas Chris New’s Andy is the one initially struggling more, unable to really focus and direct his energies now that sobriety is his friend. They’re great together, so the way the vicious spiral drags down their dreams really is quite devastating to watch. "
640,640,Ought To Be Clowns,12/08/2017,Ian,Road, Royal Court,"As somebody who grew up on the outskirts of a depressed Lancashire town in the 1980s, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from the Royal Court’s revival of Jim Cartwright’s seminal debut play Road. I was only seven when the play was written (1986) and truth be told, we were far enough out of town to be on the right side of the road but still, there was a definite sense of intrigue to my anticipation. Safe to say, the play did not reveal any biographical insight into the early life of Clowns (or anyone he went to school tbqh) but nor did it emerge as a revival with much to say to Britain today. This portrait of a society scarred by Thatcherite intervention remains very much that, contemporary allusions to a society once again divided and depressed remain unexplored, frustratingly so. For the collection of sketches that make up Road remain firmly located in the 80s, something exacerbated by over-emphatic wigs and costuming that border on the parodic (although I do remember the madness that was shell-suit season). The downtrodden Valerie bemoaning her unemployed husband tendency to blow the week’s budget down the pub, hunger strikers without a purpose, dementia sufferers left to fend for themselves, so much of society locking themselves away from the harshness of the outside world – plus ça change and all that… John Tiffany wasn’t the first director that came to mind when thinking about this play and his normally sure touch feels like it has gone a little awry here. There’s brilliant use of music and movement to be sure but staging that doesn’t work too (the audience stuff made me cringe) as the monologues that pepper the sketches beat us over the head with their brutal emotional honesty through a glass box that appears in the middle of the stage (those glass boxes didn’t make it to Wigan I’ll tell you that much)."
641,641,Ought To Be Clowns,07/10/2018,Ian,The Village, Theatre Royal Stratford East,"A free adaptation of Lope de Vega’s Fuenteovejuna by April de Angelis, Nadia Fall’s debut season as AD of Theatre Royal Stratford East starts off in fine style with The Village. Harking back to the past as Joan Littlewood directed it here in 1955, it also looks firmly to the future as a statement of intent about how things are going to be different out East. The play has been resituated from Spain to northern India and set in the modern day. And in these Kavanaugh-plagued times, there’s something of a gut punch about the way how, even with fast-forwarding half a century, this kind of story can remain so horribly pertinent. What is does remind us though, is of the importance of resistance and the strength that can come from a community.   Anya Chalotra’s genuinely excellent Jyoti is rather content with her lot in her village of Sahaspur – she’s got friends (a scene-stealingly good Rina Fatania), and a nice guy to flirt with (a most appealing Scott Karim). The arrival of a corrupt and misogynistic Inspector shatters the calm, but that in turn provokes an extraordinary response, that whilst it may not be a template of action to copy, could probably serve as inspiration for not settling with the status quo. Topically, it works like a dream. The nationalistic fervour Art Malik’s Inspector foments and the politics of division, the culture of violence against women that is dragged out of the shadows, the thirst for revenge – it pulses with resonance. And as Jyoti is pushed to her breaking point, the way in which she becomes a totemic figure for the women of the village is an extraordinary thing to see.   "
642,642,Ought To Be Clowns,14/06/2014,mag9l,Dealer’s Choice, Royal and Derngate,"Combining theatre trips with work meetings has proven more difficult in recent months but I was glad to able to make it up to Northampton to see Patrick Marber’s Dealer’s Choice before it closed, not least for the chance to see Cary Crankson who has been one of the highlights of the Faction’s rep seasons for me. And as the tragi-comic Muggsy who can’t help but be gullible, he’s an endearing delight in what was a highly enjoyable production. The play is a snapshot of British masculinity in crisis – restaurant owner Stephen runs a poker game every Sunday after closing in which his employees and son regularly participate, their varying addictions to gambling having shaped their lives and their relationships to a point where this could be said to be the highlight of their respective weeks. At this particular game though, slow-building pressures threaten to explode as debts are called in. Much of the joy in Michael Longhurst’s production comes from the interplay between the men and the intimacy that exists between them, whether positive or negative. Oliver Coopersmith and Richard Hawley have an engagingly difficult dynamic as father and son, Carl Prekopp’s cook movingly portrays the helplessness of a would-be decent father and Ian Burfield’s manipulative interloper has a sinuous power that is only slowly, cleverly revealed."
643,643,Ought To Be Clowns,08/07/2014,mag9l,Hobson’s Choice, Open Air Theatre,"Harold Brighouse’s 1916 play Hobson’s Choice is regarded a good old-fashioned British classic and features on the NT2000 Top 100 plays list so when a production was announced at the Bolton Octagon earlier this year, I was keen to see it for the first time. Sure enough, having made that trip the Open Air Theatre then announced their own revival at the distinctly more convenient location of Regents Park but hey ho, you can’t win ‘em all. And in all honesty, I did prefer the bona fide Northern version. Nadia Fall’s production here feckles the show a little too much, moving it into the 60s which undoubtedly gives it a brighter sense of modernity but one which also flies in the face of many of the gender relationships of the play – the huge social change of the time is quietly forgotten for the most part, an inconvenient truth when so much of the writing is about specific notions of parental obedience and the bestowing of dowries. "
644,644,Ought To Be Clowns,26/02/2010,Ian,Henry V, Southwark Playhouse,"One is given a pass along with your ticket which allocates one to either the English or the French army: this governs where one sits in the theatre and there’s a little playing along too, as we’re exhorted to rise when the King first arrives and it’s all jolly fun initially. The floor is covered with a large scale map of England and France, and the seating is arranged around all four sides, creating the stage, or game-board in the middle. This is where Shakespeare’s play of fast-maturing Henry V’s attempts to conquer France, culminating in the famous battle of Agincourt, is told by our players in a really quite bizarre fashion. They arrive on stage all dressed in school gym wear, white shirts, shorts and plimsolls and some lovely yellow bumbags (or fanny packs for any American readers) and wearing either blue or red vests with their characters names emblazoned on the back. As they shift from character to character, they change vests to ones with different names on, all stashed away in the bumbags, a conceit which didn’t really work for me.  We’re then subjected to the introduction of the ‘innovations’ which allegedly help to tell the story (although I suspect that every single one of them simply delayed the story-telling). For the most part though, these innovations just don’t work. Chorus constantly rolls a dice, the outcome of which has no impact on anything whatsoever, Henry juggles, audience members were twice beckoned onto the stage to (awkwardly) deliver lines. Rather tellingly, hardly any of these things reappeared in the second half, perhaps an indication of the experimental style not being fully believed in by all concerned. As for ‘innovative movement sequences’, that is stretching it somewhat. There’s nothing here that hasn’t been seen before, not least in an Olivia Newton-John video which Henry’s red headband and tight white polo-shirt kept reminding me of: the endless jogging on the spot representing the army moving forward soon grew wearisome as nothing else was happening at the same time, the story wasn’t being advanced at all and it wasn’t always abindantly clear what they were doing or where they were going. By the time they got their pac-a-macs out of the bumbags, I was ready for deserting this army. There’s no real sense of seriousness to the whole proceedings, exemplified by the use of tiny fluorescent toy guns, meaning scenes like the execution of Bardolph stick out like a sore thumb: if war is just a game, as they seem to be telling us, then I’d hate to play Monopoly with them. And in trivialising its subject matter such, it makes it extremely hard to give two figs about what is happening or who is going to win. But it is also weak in the basics as well. In this echoey chamber with the frequent rumblings of nearby trains, care always needs to be taken that speech can be heard, an attention to detail which can be partly rectified with some notes to the actors to speak up and more clearly, but the staging means that many of the scenes played in corners were unintelligible through poor blocking, on top of the volume issues. Only Anna McSweeney’s Chorus seemed to have an understanding of how to deliver her lines appropriately in this venue. And the less said about the acting, the better. Most are too busy delivering whichever annoying little trick is next or concentrating on getting their vests on the right way round to give any real performance of note. There’s no doubting the enthusiasm of all involved here, but I found little to be able to say that I could recommend this to anyone. An interesting concept alone is not enough when trying to re-envision Shakespeare, it needs to be well-thought-through and executed throughout, but also backed up by clear verse-reading and a strong sense of story-telling, none of which were sadly in evidence here: one ends up feeling there’s a real sense of ‘(poor) jack of all trades, master of none’. Oh. My. Giddy. Aunt.  BTW: short Shakespeare is all the rage. Sam Mendes' Bridge Project Tempest is apparently 2h15 with no interval. Well as long as it is short Shakespeare rather than Shakespeare as Olivia Newton-John videos, I can live with that.Although The Tempest via Xanadu…. I thought it was FANTASTIC.  A real antidote to the stuffiness of traditional productions. Shakespeare knew all about the limitations of the theatre when depicting reality, and this production really forces you to use your imagination.  Fresh, innovative and a wonderful introduction to Shakespeare for younger people."
645,645,Ought To Be Clowns,14/09/2015,mag9l,Photograph 51, Noël Coward,"The biggest shame about the long awaited return of Nicole Kidman to the London stage is that it has given many a lazy hack an excuse to rehash ‘that’ Charles Spencer quote without considering just what they are reducing this Academy Award-winning actor to. Which perhaps is an irony that is suited to Photograph 51, the play that has brought her here, a portrait of British scientist Rosalind Franklin whose role in the discovery of the structure of DNA, of “the secret to life” itself as the publicity breathily puts it, is one that has been shamefully sidelined. Anna Ziegler’s play explores the life of the research scientist with surprising depth and clarity – there’s no danger of being blinded by science here – as she follows the two rival teams trying to crack the code of the double helix. Franklin was the only woman working on either team and there is no hiding of the fact that she was strong-willed to the point of being obstinate and innately distrustful of those around her, even her King’s College colleagues, and thus showing how personality as much as intelligence had a role to play in the discoveries that were to come. Michael Grandage’s production might surprise some in that it is more of an ensemble piece than a true star vehicle but that’s only to show the complexity of the situation and indeed of Franklin herself. The sure-voiced Kidman gives convincing life to this prickly persona but also leaves us questioning whether it is just a protective distancing mechanism or in fact the driving force that got her where she was. To argue had she been friendlier to her rivals she’d have got there first is to ignore the fact that her isolating determination may well have been a key part of her success. Ziegler cleverly gives Franklin’s male compatriots fully rounded characters too, no easy villains here, and their debates about the decisions they made, the adrenaline of being so close, the justifications of how things played out offer alternative insights, not just into being a scientist but also into the flawed motivations that make us ineffably human. Stephen Campbell Moore and Joshua Silver as those on her side and Will Attenborough and Edward Bennett as Watson and Crick on the other, are all highly watchable, their experiences as inextricably entwined with Franklin’s as the double helix itself."
646,646,Ought To Be Clowns,01/06/2016,mag9l,Sunset at the Villa Thalia, National,"It’s the ideal isn’t it, shipping off to a Greek island to escape grey clouds in June and point-settling about plus ones, and its what Charlotte and Theo have done in Alexi Kaye Campbell’s new play Sunset at the Villa Thalia. He’s a playwright seeking inspiration, she’s an actress who loves him very much, and so they’re renting a cottage on the idyllic isle of Skiathos. But the year is 1967, a momentous year in Greece’s political history, and the American couple they’ve bumped into at the port aren’t quite as benign as they might seem. Harvey and June are swiftly invited over for drinks on the terrace and as tongues are loosened on the ouzo, we discover that he works for the US government in a shadowy role. With these heavy hints of the CIA, we discover what Kaye Campbell is up to as it was American intervention – in aid of stifling the threat of Soviet expansion – that arguably partly facilitated the military coup that’s about to happen. And it’s not just nations he’s manipulating but the people around him, as he convinces Charlotte and Theo to buy the cottage from its desperate owners who are emigrating to Australia. Though the sun-baked stone of Hildegard Bechtler’s design and the warm tones of Natasha Chivers’ lighting are wistfully dreamy, and Kaye Campbell infuses his writing with a good measure of comedy, Sunset at the Villa Thalia actually deals with something more dramatically compelling in Simon Godwin’s occasionally over-emphatic production. Greece here is a microcosm of the global battle waging between capitalism and communism, with Harvey as the totemic figure for neoliberalism and its determination that their version of democracy is the only kind. Ben Miles is excellent here, creating a real man out of all that political posturing and moving too in the second act, set nearly a decade later, when much has changed; Elizabeth McGovern displays considerable comic chops as the damaged June, the flipside to her husband’s, or even her nation’s, behaviour; and as the Brits, Pippa Nixon and Sam Crane are beautifully matched, her moral indignation strong enough for two but undermined by their own actions, their own intervention in the lives of the Greek family from whom they bought the house."
647,647,Ought To Be Clowns,18/12/2013,Ian,Lizzie Siddal, Arcola,"The tangled personal lives of the Pre-Raphaelite painters and those that inspired them have been much explored by art historians and television makers alike (amongst many) and so Jeremy Green’s play – Lizzie Siddal at the Arcola – enters a crowded marketplace and doesn’t quite manage to make enough of a name for itself to stand out. Lotte Wakeham’s production is perfectly watchable, boasting a strong central performance from Emma West as ‘the muse that could’, but never really reaches beyond the world of biopic. Siddal was a young woman who found herself at the centre of a vibrant art movement in the form of the Pre-Raphaelites – inspiring many, posing as models for some (Millais’ Ophelia for one) and also harbouring her own ambitions of becoming an artist. The play looks at how her relationship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti hampered her, along with the difficulties in negotiating the attentions of her powerful patron John Ruskin and the ill health that plagued her life, resulting in an addiction to laudanum that proved disastrous."
648,648,Ought To Be Clowns,06/09/2013,Ian,Pope Joan – National Youth Theatre of Great Britain at St James’s Church Piccadilly,,"Thickly pungent clouds of incense, masses of supernumeraries dressed as glowering monks, the plaintive drone of the organ interrupted only by the dramatic peals of the church bells – there could hardly be a more atmospheric venue for the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain to launch their autumn season. And in Louise Brealey’s debut play Pope Joan, the ecclesiastical setting of St James’s Church in Piccadilly gains an especial resonance given that even now, over 1000 years since the apocryphal medieval story took place, the Church still doesn’t know how to deal with women.  Brealey, perhaps unfairly best known as the wretched Molly in Sherlock, has alighted on the ninth century legend of the only woman ever to have (allegedly) become pope and used it to explore the uneasy interface between gender and religion, the way in which the patriarchy has assumed dominance over society and will do anything to protect, and also the journey of one person’s faith and their struggle to be able to pursue it as their spirit dictates. Director Paul Hart’s production is awash with ambience and feeling yet though it sets a vividly expressionistic scene, a lack of contextual detail makes earlier scenes a tad confusing. More could be done to differentiate the tangle of churchmen who surround Joan and her rise through the church’s hierarchy is left tantalisingly unexplored. But as the elements of the play coalesce to portray her discovery and downfall, it finds a compelling power and one which is augmented beautifully by intercut scenes of her younger self as she uncovers the joys of reading and religion that the world would hide from her. Choral arrangement of several Antony and the Johnsons songs add another, more contemporary, layer to the questions of gender raised within too, to goose-bumping effect."
649,649,Ought To Be Clowns,19/05/2013,Ian,Public Enemy, Young Vic,"The phrase ‘timely revival’ is one much abused by reviewers and theatre marketers alike but it is genuinely amazing how strongly the resonances of a piece of writing from 1882 chime in today’s world. Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People, retitled here as Public Enemy in a terse new version by David Harrower, rails against government corruption, the treatment of whistle-blowers, unscrupulous clothing factory owners and foretells a world of growing ecological and environmental calamity. It is a powerfully compelling tale, cheekily updated to the 1970s here, and one which wriggles uncomfortably beneath the skin. Stockmann is a principled doctor in a provincial Norwegian town famed for its spa baths but when he discovers that the waters are poisonous and need to be shut down and announces this to the town at large, he is not met with the gratitude and acclaim he expects but rather is ostracised and demonised by the leaders of the town’s society. Chief among these in the mayor but as is often the way in small-town politics, he just happens to be Stockmann’s brother. The battle for public opinion that ensues is then bitterly fought as Stockmann, Ibsen thinly veiling his contempt for the frosty reception of his previous play Ghosts, reacts to becoming the enemy of the people. Over the course of an uninterrupted 100 minutes, Richard Jones’ production rattles through the play with a liberating sense of freshness, almost cartoon-like in its palette. Miriam Buether’s design is a Scandi-overdose of domestic wares; Nicky Gillibrand’s costumes are a riot of 70s colour and shape and Mimi Jordan Sherin’s lighting is inescapably searching, leaving nowhere to hide, not even for the audience in the crucial town hall debate. This is a commanding re-reading of this particular scene, Nick Fletcher’s doctor full of bristling indignance that one sympathises with but soon tipping over into arrogant presumption, and though there may not be quite the resounding sense of a town entirely against this man, instead Jones draws us directly into the debate and exposes our reactions to this deconstruction of democratic ideals. But the richness of Stockmann as a character and of Fletcher’s stellar interpretation here comes at the expense of a cast of effective supporting players. The other people in Stockmann’s life and in the play at large are just not fleshed out enough to really serve as useful dramatic counterweights, so it is to the credit of actors like Charlotte Randle as his wife, Beatrice Walker as his daughter (a notable debut) and Bryan Dick as a pernicious journalist that they bring a vividness to their performances that lingers in the mind, especially in the striking final image with its slightly terrifying intimation at the path ahead. "
650,650,Ought To Be Clowns,28/11/2019,Ian,West Side Story, Curve,"The Royal Exchange may have gotten there first this year but Nikolai Foster’s production of West Side Story for Leicester’s Curve proves an absolute triumph. Going down a similar route of featuring brand-new choreography, here by Ellen Kane, the familiar becomes something refreshing and new and hugely emotionally satisfying. From its opening moments which set the anti-immigrant tone like never before, through Musical Supervisor Sarah Travis’ incredible treatment of this iconic Bernstein score, to Kane’s sensational set-pieces which fill every inch of the Curve’s stage, this is damn close to musical theatre perfection.  It works so well because for all of the epic sweep of its Romeo and Juliet-inspired story, this is a very intimate reading of it. Jamie Muscato and Adriana Ivelisse really are exceptional as the ill-fated lovers Tony and Maria, delivering an unforced chemistry that is sweetness personified. Theirs is a heady, instant passion that feels so natural as to be entirely captivating. Their flirting is delicately but determinedly done – there’s no mistaking what ‘Tonight’ holds here – and something ignites in them when together. And as understated as their acting is, magic happens when they start to sing. Muscato’s ‘Maria’ is as good as I’ve ever heard in my life, as natural as breathing and then taken up to the heavens with a touch of wonder with his deeply expressive tenor. And Ivelisse’s thrilling soprano imbues ‘I Feel Pretty’ with just the right amount of character to refresh its familiar rhymes.  The emphasis on the emotional throughline is apparent everywhere. The choice to make ‘Gee Officer Krupke’ a vaudeville number delivered in front of the curtain is inspired – as is a perfectly timed bit of spotlighting – a way to make sense of the trauma the Jets have just gone through. Michael Taylor’s design never lets you forget the poverty in which everyone here subsists, from the worn stars and stripes to the mounds of rubble onstage. And there’s a clever nuance to the characterisation within the Jets, Ryan Anderson, Dale White, Alex Christian, Isaac Gryn and Michael O’Reilly all impressive in their own way. Far from a homogenous group there’s a real sense of varying personalities and commitment to the cause, never clearer than the diverse responses to the attempted sexual assault of Anita – Carly Mercedes Dyer in scorchingly good form in what ought to be a breakout year for her. "
651,651,Ought To Be Clowns,14/07/2013,Ian,Circle Mirror Transformation, Royal Court Local,"Whilst Vicky Featherstone has turned over the keys of the Royal Court’s Sloane Square home for the Open Court festival, the more traditional business of regular plays continues with Circle Mirror Transformation. But even this strains against convention, taking place under their (pre-existing) Theatre Local umbrella and introducing its audience to stations and areas such as Haggerston and De Beauvoir Town in North-East London. Annie Baker’s award-winning 2009 play takes place in a community centre in the small town of Shirley, Vermont and to replicate that feel, James Macdonald’s production takes place in the bona fide environment of the Rose Lipman community arts building, lending a veneer of authenticity that would never have been possible either upstairs or down back in SW1W. Baker’s trick here is to take us through the six weeks of a creative drama class and visit how the five people who sign up react to the therapeutic intentions of course leader Marty, For they all have issues to deal with, Marty included, and through the breathing exercises, word-association games and self-revealing acting techniques they learn, they all edge closer to an emotional breakthrough. The undoubted charms of this play ripple gently across the hall, washing over us quietly with its perceptive take on the ways in which people respond to personal turmoil, turning to others in time of need yet using them for entirely different means.  Schultz, a recently divorced chair-maker, and Theresa, an actress just relocated from NYC, are both struggling to deal with the baggage that comes with imploding relationships; 16 year old Lauren is escaping the trouble that dominates her family home; and Marty’s own marriage to James, who is also taking the class, is facing its own battles against wilful step-daughters and hidden secrets. And the playwright teases so much of this information out in the most ingenious of ways, through the games that they play in class, through the mouths of others as they describe their colleagues and re-enact important moments from their lives. It seems a shame then that she doesn’t quite have the courage of her convictions to go the whole hog with this format and she slowly introduces scenes of dialogue bookending the classes which tell us more but also dilute its unique feel. But when it works, which it frequently does, the subtle undercurrents pull us with a surprisingly effective force, driven by one of the best assembled casts of the year. Toby Jones is a comic revelation as Schultz, a man who try as he might cannot overcome his complete lack of creative imagination but who recognises another bruised soul in Theresa and sets about an ill-advised yet painfully hilariously observed liaison with her. The ever-excellent Fenella Woolgar shines as the fragilely vivacious Theresa, her confidence outwardly bright yet scarcely masking the pain inside; Shannon Tarbet’s sharp-eyed Lauren emerges gracefully from her recalcitrant shell; and Danny Webb bubbles with unreconciled feeling as his dissatisfaction with life becomes increasingly hard to hide. And at the centre of them all, Imelda Staunton’s Marty is extraordinary – steely determination when it comes to the activities and all motherly encouragement in getting her charges to participate but it is in the moments when she isn’t talking that one is reminded how superb an actress she really is, her face conveying so much about the depths of her private despair. "
652,652,Ought To Be Clowns,12/03/2020,Ian,Sugar Coat, VAULT Festival,"Written by Joel Samuels (A Wake in Progress, which DESTROYED me last year) and Lilly Pollard, the show spares no prisoners in a forthright depiction of eight formative years of a young woman’s life as she experiences much – too much – of what life has to offer as sexual thrills sit next to shattering trauma.  Presented by an all-womxn band who dip in and out of playing characters and instruments, Riot Grrrl-inspired songs bleed into short scenes and back again, creating a vibe of almost performance art-level that director Celine Lowenthal marshals well. It also proves a canny decision as it carefully means the moves into emotionally bruising territory don’t carry their own trauma with them. "
653,653,Ought To Be Clowns,20/04/2018,Ian,The Country Wife, Southwark Playhouse,"A swift run through The Country Wife as it is finishing its residency at the Southwark Playhouse this weekend and I’m not too sure I got on with it all too well. Luke Fredericks’ vibrant production for Morphic Graffiti certainly has a muscular visual appeal but I’m not convinced it offers a case for a revival of William Wycherley’s play. Originally a Restoration comedy, it has been updated to the world of the Bright Young Things of the 1920s. And in it, randy upper class people chase other randy upper class people and… well, that’s about it. Whether through the shift in era or something more deliberate, the women of the story find themselves front and centre, particularly pleasing as it is about them asserting their sexuality.  That’s not Fredericks’ only innovation. The production is suffused with song and dance, jazz-age covers of pop staples pepper the many many scene changes and whilst effective in establishing the DNA of this revival and its considerable energy, it also has the effect of sapping its pace increasingly fatally."
654,654,Ought To Be Clowns,27/10/2015,mag9l,Husbands and Sons, National Theatre,"You have to respect the huge ambition behind Husbands and Sons, Marianne Elliott and Ben Power’s adaptation of three DH Lawrence plays which sees each of them run simultaneously in the round in the Dorfman. It manages this by taking the Holroyds from The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd, the Gascoignes from The Daughter-in-Law and the Lamberts from A Collier’s Friday Night and imagining them living on the same street in the East Midlands village of Eastwood. And spread over three weeks in October 1911, the interlocked, if not intersecting, dramas of their lives play out, dominated by the long shadow of the pit.  Initially it’s a dizzying affair, as the eye and the ear deals with the three separate domestic establishments. Bunny Christie’s design takes a visual cue from the Lars von Trier film Dogville with the fully furnished houses demarcated by white lines on the floor and labelled by name, doors (and coats, weirdly) are mimed with accompanying sound effects. And with a nod to the fixedness of this arrangement, ticket-holders in the pit swap seats at the interval, getting to sit in the corresponding place on the other side of the auditorium, offering an alternative perspective on the goings-on. It may seem like a lot of fussiness but for me it worked beautifully, what the collage effect of bringing these three plays together like this may lose in the detail of the individual works, it surely gains in this creation of a real sense of community. Even if the characters never really formally interact, the intimacy of village life is brought beautifully to life – the looks across the room as the screams and shouts of a domestic echo down the lane, the secret small act of kindness from one mother to another, the physical support needed to roll back home from a boozy night at the local. And of course, the way in which coal mining overshadows all of their lives. The majority of the men of each household, the husbands, the sons, are miners and the hardship of their families’ lives in what interests Lawrence the most, placing the wives (and daughters and mothers) at the heart of each story. This is what Elliott and Power do too, Anne-Marie Duff’s Lizzie Holroyd, Julia Ford’s Lydia Lambert and Louise Brealey’s Minnie Gascoigne each become focal points, not just for the drama but also in rare moments of expressive beauty where Scott Graham’s movement comes beautifully into play. They’re supported by an excellent company: Philip McGinley’s kindly visitor and Martin Marquez’s brutish husband tug the conflicted Lizzie between them (and Duff is brilliant here); Ford’s Lydia struggles to find a home for her affections between Lloyd Hutchinson’s disinterested husband and Johnny Gibbon’s son who has escaped for college; and the marvelously possessed Minnie, a striking Brealey, deals wonderfully with the trials of Susan Brown’s amusing interfering mother-in-law (“Marriage is like a mousetrap for either man or woman. You soon come to the end of the cheese”), Matthew Barker’s brother-in-law and Joe Armstrong (her erstwhile partner in Constellations) as husband Luther. "
655,655,Ought To Be Clowns,01/05/2013,Ian,The Pajama Game, Minerva,"Old Broadway classics seem to flourish in the rarefied air of West Sussex and it is hard to shake the feeling that Chichester has done it again with a revival of The Pajama Game. No stranger to big American musicals, director Richard Eyre demonstrates the surest of touches to keep the improbable subject matter – the trials of working life in a pyjama factory – anchored in a world that we always care about and is aided by the kind of score that feels recognisable even if you think you haven’t heard it before. Richard Adler and Jerry Ross’ score is full of fantastic old school tunes like Hey There (You with the Stars in your Eyes) and Steam Heat and two of the songs were actually written by Frank Loesser, although uncredited.  George Abbott and Richard Bissel’s book is based on Bissell’s novel 7½ cents set in the Cedar Rapids, Iowa Sleep-Tite factory in which new-to-town Superintendent Sid Sorokin finds himself falling head over heels for feisty union rep Babe Williams, whose stubborn initial resistance can’t ignore the mutually fiery passion between them. But trouble brews when the workers are denied a justified 7½ cent pay rise and Sid and Babe find themselves on opposing sides of a heated labour debate.  Joanna Riding is perfect casting as the spirited and independently-minded Babe. She brims with the self-confidence of someone in complete professional control – able to see through the grasping claims of a lazy chancer – but also brings a layered nuance to her emotional life, bemused at the prospect of a romance, delightfully exuberant when it comes to pass and yet firmly in control of how the relationship will progress, regardless of the sizzling chemistry. And she does connect extremely well with Hadley Fraser’s Sid, a goofily handsome presence but one imbued with a rich sense of yearning by his remarkable voice and together they make a couple that one simply cannot help but root for. The richness of the female characters doesn’t stop there either. As Sid’s secretary Mabel, Claire Machin is a twinkle-eyed bundle of joy possessed of a wonderfully dry wit and Gladys, the boss’ secretary, is given hugely vibrant life by Alexis Owen-Hobbs who brings enough of a comic edge to temper the ditziness and is a sheer standout as a dancer. Peter Polycarpou’s knife-throwing Vernon brings comic relief alongside an energetic turn from Eugene McCoy as the nerdish union president Prez and the whole company emanate a lovely warmth. Eyre plays up the bonds of family and camaraderie to neatly remind us that we really are stronger together.  Stephen Mears’ expansive choreography adds a fizzing sense of life throughout – the group work at the picnic in ‘Once-A-Year Day’ is sensational, and the Owen-Hobbs-led Act 2 opener ‘Steam Heat’ are major highlights – but there is the occasional feel that it is a little constrained on this stage, with not quite enough room to fully breathe and extend its lines. Gareth Valentine’s ten-strong orchestra (I hope they’re all wearing those pyjamas…) sound excellent on these refreshed arrangements and Tim Hatley’s design makes great use of castors to keep everything mobile which allows for smartly fast-moving scene changes from factory floors to offices to forest clearings to a most appealing Mexican bar."
656,656,Ought To Be Clowns,25/03/2011,Ian,Betty Blue Eyes, Novello,"With a book by Ron Cowen + Daniel Lipman, adapted from the story of the film A Private Function by Alan Bennett + Malcolm Mowbray and with a score by George Stiles + Anthony Drewe and marking a rare excursion back into producing from Cameron Mackintosh, Betty Blue Eyes is a new musical at the Novello Theatre with a lot of names credited on the poster! Set in Shepardsford, a Yorkshire town in 1947 at the height of post-war austerity (and previews, which this was, are being sold at austerity prices!), the plot follows Gilbert Chilvers a chiropodist and his frustrated wife Joyce, chafing under the restrictions of the time and who yearns to be accepted into the higher echelon of society where she believes they belong. They are not having much joy until they happen upon a secret plot by the town council to hold a feast for this elite in honour of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip’s impending marriage at which an illegally kept pig will be the star of the banquet. So, this being a comedy, they steal the pig. But it is about something more too, over and above the farcical shenanigans with Betty the pig, especially in the more reflective first half. This is a society struggling to come to terms with the enduring impact of the Second World War, the melancholy ‘Magic Fingers’ in particular looking at the wives left behind, as rationing hits hard, threatening to dampen the spirit of those just trying to carry on living in hard times yet still nurturing their own dreams and ambitions. And this is where Stiles + Drewe’s score comes into its own, suffused with a beautiful warmth: it really is stuffed full of tunes, their comical songs are deliciously witty whilst advancing the story, there’s simple but affecting emotion in the balladry and more than once, I found myself just swaying along with a grin on my face (and not just because Liza Minnelli was just a couple of seats away from us). It all has that kind of nostalgic feel that makes for easy recognition and it is a score I wanted to hear again from the moment the show finished. Joyce is at the heart of this show, despite the title, and she, much like Pat in Flare Path, has to come to terms with decisions made in wartime and reassessing her personal ambitions in light of the realities of being a married woman. And Sarah Lancashire really pulls it off as the star of the show. Dancing and singing like a dream, her ‘Nobody’ is one of the show’s highlights and she pulls the show through whilst the first half clicks into place around her. Reece Shearsmith as her slightly dippy husband is a likeable everyman figure but could do with squeezing a little more winning charm into his stage presence as he tends to blend into the ensemble a little too much, he is the leading man after all, but he is lovely to watch. And Ann Emery as Mother Dear who lives with this couple is a scene-stealing genius, bringing the house down with a mere look and incredibly sprightly on her feet at the end of the show hoedown. This is an ensemble just oozing quality though and it shows from the main supporting characters right down to the smallest cameos which were spot on in their execution. Personal favourites included Kirsty Hoiles’ prim Mrs Allardyce and Jack Edwards’ tender-hearted Henry Allardyce (he is one of at least three performers from the recent Sweet Charity), Ian Conningham’s Sergeant Noble (who no matter what he says, should wash his hands afterwards!) and Dan Burton’s Prince Phillip impersonation to name but a few. David Bamber’s devious Councillor Swaby is well done, though the character’s casual anti-Semitism is causing a little rumpus (it is a sensitive subject but it has to be said it is time-appropriate and not really gratuitous) but the other ‘villain’ Adrian Scarborough’s Meat Inspector Wormwood is a curious character, dressed up like Allo Allo’s Herr Flick and uncertainly pitched between pantomime villain and fetishist which didn’t always work for me. The ensemble deal well with Stephen Mears’ fabulous choreography: the Lindy Hop routine prior to the interval is just fantastic and I loved the stylised townswomen’s movements to ‘It’s an Ill Wind’. But what is really testament to the talent here is how evenly spread the vocals are, uniformly strong (this bodes extremely well should understudies be called upon) but almost everyone gets a chance to shine, with the two different trios of ladies, the first for ‘Magic Fingers’ and the second singing ‘Lionheart’ as Billy Carroll’s Trio particularly impressing. In a year that has been acclaimed the year of the British musical, I am going to stick my neck out and say that Betty Blue Eyes will be among, if not the best of the bunch. There are slight quibbles to be sure (and not just the fact there is a animatronic puppet animal in here, it is a bit freaky with its constant head movements so I couldn’t watch it for too long) but not enough to stop me from giving this a whole-hearted five stars and the strongest recommendation in its tribute to the indefatigable post-war spirit, something we could all learn from with the endless threat of cuts today, although I’m not sure how many people will be rushing out to create a Spam banquet for Wills and Kate’s impending nuptials…! Betty Blue Eyes is sweet and warm and funny, well-danced, well-acted, well-sung, Kylie’s in it (well, her voice), Liza loved it, seriously, what more do you want?! Great review as always, Ian. Gosh, was Dame Liza at this too … she must be being treated to the turkey and ham double-feast by Cameron because she had to sit through 'Umbrellas of Cherbourg' too. I wonder if she's been to 'End of the Rainbow' and, if so, was she swaying along to that?"
657,657,Ought To Be Clowns,08/02/2015,Ian,Othello, Rose Bankside,"Early February and I’m already on my second Othello of the year. Not only that, it’s the second one to both modernise it and condense the play down to well under two hours. But where Frantic Assembly moved the action in the violence of northern gang-life, Time Zone Theatre relocate it to the cut and thrust of corporate office politics and director Pamela Schermann goes even further in slimming the cast down to five bodies (plus Bianca’s voice Skyping in). It’s a bold reimagining – especially in a venue as soaked in archaeological significance as the Rose, Bankside – but one that pays off. Stripped off pretty much every sub-plot, the story becomes one of cut-throat careerism, the promotion that Iago is passed over for thus a much more recognisable one and represented simply but effectively by the relative plushness of an executive office chair (astute design from Gillian Stevenson) in which people will kill to sit. This production is dominated by Trevor Murphy’s sharply-suited Iago and all of his compelling charisma (was ever a strawberry eaten so malevolently?). Whether in pointed voiceover, Machiavellian (or should that be Francis Urquhart-ian) asides or the simmering contempt with which he deals with the situation around him, he’s an irresistible force of nature manipulating everyone and everything to his will – just watch how he manoeuvres Othello out of that chair (and himself into it) at a crucial moment. James Barnes’ Othello is a little pallid by comparison, not quite magisterial enough in his earlier moments but Samantha Lock’s Desdemona is a thrillingly self-possessed equal in the office and they share a rather lovely chemistry. Ella Duncan’s sparky Emilia also makes her mark alongside Denholm Spurr’s Cassio in this tightly compacted company, all refining their characters to fit into this modern business world yet still paying attention to the Shakespearean poetry. There’s great work creatively too, especially given the limitations of the space. Pushing one scene outside the expected boundaries is hugely effective and the ominous drips of Philip Matejtschuk’s sound encourage a darkening mood. But I really loved what Petr Vocka’s lighting achieved in really segmenting the production between exterior action and interior thought and whilst jealousy may be a green-eyed monster, it’s the red heat of anger that illuminates the climax, again to great effect."
658,658,Ought To Be Clowns,08/04/2020,Ian,Rare Earth Mettle, Royal Court,"There’s not a lot of info around about Al Smith’s play Rare Earth Mettle which should have opened at the Royal Court this week. But an attractive looking cast had me intrigued and given the uniqueness of Hamish Pirie’s last two productions for the Royal Court (Instructions for Correct Assembly; Goats), I’m sure it would have been a good’un. Let’s hope it comes back. "
659,659,Ought To Be Clowns,27/07/2018,Ian,Miss Littlewood, Swan Theatre,"The last musical to come out of the RSC is a little know thing that is still kicking around somewhere, Matilda I think it’s called… So Miss Littlewood might have a little expectation carrying on its shoulders, although it is clearly a completely different kettle of fish. In the Swan Theatre, Sam Kenyon (book, music and lyrics) tells us the story of Joan Littlewood. Or rather, given the format of the show, hands the reins over to Joan to tell her story. Clare Burt stars as an older Littlewood who acts as a narrator, a maestro, as she directs six other performers, all of whom take turns in donning the blue cap to embody this most totemic figure of British theatre.   Book-wise, it’s a rather conventional biography. But from East End beginnings and disappointments at RADA to her realisation as a political theatremaker in the North West and her establishment of the Theatre Workshop at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, it is quite the story to tell. And Erica Whyman’s production has huge amount of fun in telling it, using gender-, colour- and age-blind casting to cover any number of supporting characters to pop up throughout (Hal Prince, Barbara Windsor, John Gielgud to name but a few). There’s no shirking the truth either that Littlewood was a complex figure and a frustrating one (for some) to know. "
660,660,Ought To Be Clowns,08/05/2012,Ian,Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare on 3,"After Twelfth Night, the Shakespeare on 3 radio season continues with Romeo and Juliet with the same company, plus a few additions, taking on the Bard’s work again. Whereas there’s a nice sense of continuity about it, it’s an odd choice as there’s another play, The Tempest, to complete the season which uses a different cast. And it is also a slightly difficult choice in the limitations it imposes on the casting, although this may just be a personal thing as it took a long time for me accept the idea of Trystan Gravelle, an actor I really like, as the teenage Romeo. His voice is so melodiously identifiable that I completely failed at convincing myself I was listening to Romeo rather than Gravelle, and even if you’re not familiar with him, I’m pretty sure he just sounds too old and experienced for the role. Paired with Vanessa Kirby as Juliet, whose voice I struggled to warm to in Twelfth Night, it made for an ignominious beginning despite the evocative sound design of the piece. But something eventually clicked after about an hour, whether it was my preconception finally dying down or the production finding another gear or some combination of both, and from their post-coital glow of tenderness I completely bought into them as a couple. Judicious cuts keep the play down to a brisk 2 hours, but it was nice to see a little innovation creeping into the recutting of the production. The way in which Friar Laurence’s plotting in Act IV Scene I is interleaved with snippets of what follows to bring us up swiftly up to Scene V’s shocking discovery by the Nurse is brilliantly executed, showcasing as it did two of the best performances. Rosie Cavaliero’s bustling, girlish Nurse and a tender Friar from Ron Cook, his final self-lacerating confession extremely moving."
661,661,Ought To Be Clowns,14/01/2015,Ian,Singin’ in the Rain, Upstairs at the Gatehouse,"As unlikely as it may seem, you could easily make the case that some of the best musical theatre happening in London right now is taking place above a pub in Highgate. John and Katie Plews’ Ovation Productions have a sterling record in small-scale smash-hit musicals at the Upstairs at the Gatehouse theatre and their festive shows are usually the pick of the bunch. This winter sees them take on the perennial classic Singin’ in the Rain and naturally, it is a gloriously resounding success. And yes, of course there is rain – you gotta go to see how they do it though. The key to the Plews’ triumph lies in the uncanny ability to both distil and reimagine Broadway classics perfectly for this 120-or-so seat space and often in traverse. That means choreography (from Chris Whittaker) so audacious that audiences applaud mid-song, that means design (by Sarah June Mills) that hits all the key notes – a lamppost to lean on, steps to hop up and down on, seats to tip back – without cluttering the stage, that means musical direction (from Matt Ramplin, leading a band of six) unafraid to just exude Broadway pizzazz as it delivers the superbly evergreen score. And marshalled together under John Plews’ direction, it all works together just decadently well. Monica Swelp’s silent film clips nail the hilariously histrionic tone that is falling out of fashion in Hollywood as epitomised by Thea Jo Wolfe’s uproariously squeaky Lina, Frankie Jenna (how lovely to see rise through the ranks like this to get a starring role) perfectly captures the natural charm that is rising to take its place, and the thoroughly charming and impossibly handsome and amazing dancer – God, I hate him! – Simon Adkins bridges these two worlds with real grace and dynamism."
662,662,Ought To Be Clowns,06/12/2014,Ian,Off the Page – Microplays 4-6 from the Royal Court and the Guardian,,"There’s something a little perversely ironic about Tim Price’s PPE being one of the more effective microplays (SHORT FILMS!) of the Royal Court and Guardian collaboration given how it is a wordless piece. Directed by Hamish Pirie with movement choreographed by the excellent Ann Yee, it plays off the trademark physical gestures that politicians have become known for using as an emollient to the relentlessly grim messages that they’ve had to deliver in recent years. David Annen, Cyril Nri and Eileen Walsh do a cracking job as leaders of different parties and just through physical expression, manage to hypnotise and hoodwink a whole host of supernumeraries standing in for the too-willing electorate. It’s not a world entirely without hope but it’s a powerful indictment of how much of contemporary politics is stagecraft that we just lap up. Chloë Moss’ Devil In The Detail focuses on the world of fashion, something that director Christopher Haydon laughingly admits to knowing little of but as a multi-million pound enterprise, there’s much more to it than just knowing which handbag is currently de rigueur. Moss picks up on the way that fashion can be used to bolster a person’s mood and self-belief – as Pippa Bennett-Warner and Vanessa Kirby’s characters get ready for award shows in the atelier of a hot designer – but also how the world of fashionistas can wield it as a vicious weapon as Lucy Ellinson’s killer stylist (such lipstick, so colour, many wow!) corrects the assumptions they’ve made, casually dishing out humiliation and obsequiousness which shatters the mood that playing dress-up had cultivated between the pair."

665,665,Ought To Be Clowns,08/05/2012,Ian,Twelfth Night, Shakespeare on 3,"Joining in the veritable orgy of Bard love that is currently going on, the BBC’s Shakespeare Unlocked season has a wide-ranging programme of features, not least three radio productions of his plays by the Drama on 3 team, two of which are cross-cast from the same company which was full of names I like and was keen to hear. First up was Sally Avens’ Twelfth Night, probably most notable for casting David Tennant as Malvolio. I haven’t ever just listened to a Shakespeare play before, and though I wasn’t doubting the poetry of Shakespeare’s words, I did wonder what effect removing the visual, and Twelfth Night is a very visual play, would have on the whole. Knowing the play fairly well was both a blessing and a curse in some ways – little was ever likely to surprise me and I had no sense of what this would be like for a first-time-listener, but that knowledge also meant I could relax a little rom trying to work out what was going on. And fortunately, a cast of great experience and talent meant that the thrusting of the language front and centre was a largely successful exercise. Relatively old hands like Ron Cook’s Sir Toby, Adam James’ Aguecheek and Rosie Cavaliero’s Maria ensured none of the humour of their scenes was lost, though their tricks did seem somehow crueller than usual, even if the gruff Scottish brogue of Tennant’s Malvolio curried little sympathy. Paul Ready made Orsino more appealing than usual and I really enjoyed Naomi Frederick’s Viola, whose disguising of herself as Cesario causes so much confusion."
666,666,Ought To Be Clowns,20/06/2013,Ian,Fifty Words, Arcola,"The thin line between love and hate in married couples is a well-explored one dramatically but whilst Michael Weller’s Fifty Words may not cover any huge amount of new ground in revisiting this territory, this Theatre Royal Bath and Arcola Theatre co-production is blessed with two excoriatingly intense and bruisingly emotional performances from Claire Price and Richard Clothier. Between them, they perfectly capture the vicissitudes and complexities of a long-term relationship and the strains that accompany the successes. Janine and Adam are relishing a rare opportunity to spend the evening together when their 9-year-old son Greg goes on his first sleepover. Adam’s got champagne in the fridge and a Chinese takeaway decanted into their best new serving dishes in anticipation of some long overdue sexy time but Janine’s got one eye on a presentation for a new work client the next day and so starts a downwards-spiralling rollercoaster as this couple decide to rip each other apart as opposed to ripping each other’s clothes off (although as we see, the two are not mutually exclusive), laying bare the dire state of their marriage. Spread over one endless night and confined to the one room, Weller’s canvas is necessarily small but this allows him to come up with copious amounts of whip-sharp dialogue as increasingly envenomed banter bounces back and forth and the pendulum swings from hate to love and back again and back again. But strong as this is, one can’t help but feel a little wearied by it – little is done to create any empathy for either party in this affair and it’s hard to imagine that this couple could have made it this far without killing each other. So it is to Price and Clothier’s credit that they imbue such dynamism into Jan and Adam – Clothier’s firm pecs announcing a rampant sexuality that he makes no excuses for and Price is just extraordinary as a capricious sort whose switches feel filled with genuine danger as she ricochets from emotion to emotion and one is left wondering what possible future could there be for them. But as they explore the different kinds of love (though not quite all fifty…) and increasingly bring their son back into the picture of their fractured relationship, we begin to see how compromise is just as important a part of their relationship, any relationship, as anything else. Not that this doesn’t come at a price, not at all – if you’re sitting on the left hand side as you face the stage, check out Price’s expression in the final moments – and suddenly your heart breaks as Weller finally finds a note of emotional realism that rings so horribly and affectingly true."
667,667,Ought To Be Clowns,02/03/2012,Ian,The Leisure Society, Trafalgar Studios 2,"Canadian drama doesn’t get much of a look in in London so it was interesting to see Québécois playwright François Archambault having his play The Leisure Society mounted at the Trafalgar Studios’ downstairs space. The headlines have naturally focused on the theatrical debut of former model Agyness Deyn but thespier types will appreciate the return of Ed Stoppard who illuminated his father’s Arcadia so very well a few years back (and yes, as suggested by the poster, he does get his shirt off!). The play is a scathing look at the self-obsession of the middle classes, focusing on Peter and Mary, an affluent, successful couple with a new baby yet both dealing with a deep ennui, a huge dissatisfaction with the state of their lives. As part of the ‘cleaning up’ of their lives to become ideal parents – they’ve already given up smoking and drinking – they invite best friend Mark round for dinner and to tell him that his newly-single life of debauchery doesn’t fit into their plan and so they are dumping him. But when Mark turns up with his new ‘special friend’ the lithe Paula and several bottles of wine, their plans go somewhat awry as sex, scandal and secrets end up on the menu along with the roast beef. Archambault’s humour is frequently most refreshing in its biting wit and its contemptuous tone towards these thoroughly unlikeable characters. Their determination to have it all, the perfect yuppie life that they have created plus a newborn, is skewered by the selfishness with which they live that life – their approach to parenthood is horrendously hilarious, adoption and abortion also come in for brutally funny treatment, and let’s not got started on what they actually think of each other. The introduction of Mark, whose moral compass is equally skewed and Paula whose carefree attitudes proves to be something of a catalyst for action to be taken – but only superficially, these people care only about gratification not realising the huge moral vacuum in their lives. Ed Stoppard as the neurotic and frustratingly prevaricating Peter crackles beautifully off the icy veneer of Melanie Gray’s Mary, dripping with scornful derision yet no braver than her husband in the end. John Schwab’s newly hedonistic Mark has the swagger of a much younger man and also the accompanying lack of maturity, and Deyn acquits herself well as the free-thinking Paula with a blithe ease to her sexuality. Harry Burton directs with a nice largely free-flowing touch, though I wasn’t much keen on the muzak versions of the classical music that punctuates in the scenes. The final angst-ridden twists towards a darker, more disturbing place didn’t quite feel like the right ending for me, searching for a depth it didn’t really need, but for a fast-paced, foul-mouthed, vicious ride that pulls no punches, you can’t go wrong with paying a visit to The Leisure Society."
668,668,Ought To Be Clowns,23/01/2020,Ian,The Welkin, National Theatre,"There are moments in Lucy Kirkwood’s new play The Welkin that are just outstanding. The opening tableau of silhouetted women engaged in housework is one for the ages, the early montage of women being empanelled onto a jury is as compelling a piece of social history as has ever been committed to the stage as well as looking stunning, and the final scene is equally full of iconic imagery (that veil, that walk, that ribbon, that realisation!). Set on the Norfolk/Suffolk borders in 1759, the play focuses on a quirk of English justice at the time. A child has died and Sally Poppy has been sentenced for the crime (by men) but as she is claiming to be pregnant – something which if true, would commute her sentence from death to transportation – a “jury of matrons” must decide if she is telling the truth. Thus 12 local woman are summoned and locked in a room to determine her fate.  James Macdonald’s production is at its strongest in the aforementioned book-ending sections, when the breadth of Bunny Christie’s imagination in her design choices can be unleashed. The empanelling scene where each woman is introduced with a biographical snippet (21 children and 3 husbands; menopausal sweats; 12 miscarriages…) is a masterclass in character study in miniature , setting the scene for the much grander, lengthier debates in store.   Here, The Welkin winds perhaps just a little too much, especially after the interval, as the group’s uncompromising discussions about Sally’s body and vivid recollections about their own reproductive history morph into something a touch unwieldy. Plot twist follows plot twist and though a shift into melodrama isn’t of itself a bad thing, here it toys perilously close to testing the patience  as deliberations end up delayed once again.  That said, a ferociously good ensemble leave you never less than gripped. Maxine Peake leads the way as redoutable midwife Lizzy, Cecilia Noble blesses us with another of her finely tuned scene stealers, Haydn Gwynne elegantly negotiates one of the more improbable moments, and Ria Zmitrowicz continues her development into one of our finest actresses as the spiky Sally. Philip McGinley, Wendy Kweh and Zainab Hasan also impress, heck the whole company do."
669,669,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2016,mag9l,Trident Moon, Finborough,"Art and life can intersect in the strangest of ways but I’m sure that no-one could have foreseen the horrific resonances that emerged between transatlantic headlines over the weekend and the world premiere in West London of an Indian-Canadian play set in 1947. Or maybe they could, maybe that’s the point, about the brutality that women experience at the hands of men – whether in word or in deed – a horrific brand of misogyny scarring our world and that sadly shows little signs of abating. Anusree Roy’s Trident Moon opens with a different dynamic though – it’s 1947 and the Partition of India has been hastily enforced, ripping apart society along religious lines. And in the chaos, a vengeful Alia has decided to seize her chance, taking her former employers prisoners and transporting them with her on the back of her brother-in-law’s truck on its way to West Bengal. But the journey is a hazardous one, and the six women – one of them gravely injured – find their number soon swelling to nine as they trek through dangerous territory, culminating in a harrowing stand-off.  For all the retribution the Hindu Alia wants to impose on her Muslim mistresses – and Sakuntala Ramanee maintains an extraordinary, almost disturbing, degree of intensity throughout – there’s also a pragmatism, and a tenderness there. She’s also kidnapped the mistress’s daughter, a child she practically raised whilst serving the household and when they take on the heavily pregnant Heera and the too-good-to-be-true Sumaiya (a deliciously enticing Natasha Ali), her practical instincts kick in – there’s no sense in expending too much energy on battles within the truck , when a far greater enemy lies without. Roy’s writing is uncompromising in its detail throughout the play, describing the various ways in which women and children too easily bore the brunt of rising violence during Partition. the all-important notion of honour used as a weapon against them, not least in the branding of their skin after rape, so that they’d be rejected by either and both religions. And Anna Pool’s direction equally pulls no punches, filling the air with the ominous growl of Fred Riding’s set design and largely keeping the production from ever becoming too static, even as it hardly ever moves out of the frame of Anna Driftmier’s set. And I really do mean uncompromising on behalf of both the writing and direction, as towards the end comes a scene which is quite possibly one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to keep myself watching on a theatre stage. It’s the kind of sequence which is scorched on the memory, perhaps appropriately so given the level of brutality it suggests and how it might affect real-life victims, and consequently it is just devastating. It’s almost too much for the remainder of the play to bear, it crumples rather than finishes, poignantly reminding us that there’s no neatness, no easy resolution for such issues in drama or in life, something you suspect Donald Trump will never understand."
670,670,Ought To Be Clowns,26/05/2017,Ian,On The Town, Open Air Theatre,"Fred Haig must have thought that this was his year after landing starring roles in two of the big musicals of the summer but during Monday evening’s performance, he sustained an injury to his foot which has now been confirmed as a fracture. Sadly, this means that he has had to withdraw from On The Town at the Open Air Theatre in Regent’s Park (the second actor to do so after Jeremy Taylor withdrew during rehearsals due to injury) and will be replaced by his understudy Jacob Maynard. We’ll have to wait and see if he recuperates in time to play Young Buddy in Follies at the National. It is a real shame for Haig as I was at the show on Monday, scarcely believing that we actually had lovely weather for the first musical this year at the Open Air. And Haig’s appealingly charismatic Chip, along with Lizzy Connolly’s vibrant Hildy, was among the highlights of Drew McOnie’s production and he seemed to be very much on top of the choreography. It is a dance-heavy show, and in McOnie’s hands doubly so and as so many in this venue, it is one that benefits from being seen as night falls, to behold the full beauty of Howard Hudson’s lighting which is gorgeously conceived. Maynard’s elevation has the interesting knock-on effect that all of the show’s main couples are now inter-racial and combined with one of McOnie’s innovations, it makes it a delightfully inclusive piece of theatre. And I’ll leave it at that for now, I’m hoping to get to the show again next week and if I do, I’ll review it properly then. Until such time, here’s a few production shots to feast your eyes on."
671,671,Ought To Be Clowns,14/11/2013,Ian,Scenes from a Marriage, Toneelgroep Amsterdam at the Barbican,"Stripping away all the technical innovation that has characterised Toneelgroep Amsterdam’s last two visits to London, Ivo Van Hove’s take on Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage is not just an extraordinary reinterpretation of a seminal classic but also one of the most exhilarating pieces of theatre you could hope to have the privilege to see this year. Utterly reinventing the space of the Barbican’s main theatre and toying with conventional modes of story-telling, I spent most of the astonishing second half in a state of near constant goose bumps. From the beginnings when we’re colour-coded by wristbands into three groups, it is clear something different is afoot. Jan Versweyveld’s design splits the stage into three rooms, connected by a central chamber into which we can occasionally peer, and the first half sees the audience progress through the areas, simultaneously witnessing a scene in each. Each scene features Johan and Marianne and the implosion of their picture-perfect marriage but van Hove has three different couples play the roles at different points in their relationship. Splintered, the audience experiences the story differently – from the first signs of crisis through the emergence of real problems to the inevitable break-up, the order is shuffled, our perspective altered depending on the point of entry. Our experience is also informed by the proximity of the three locales – the screaming match that forms the centre of one of the scenes is heard throughout the whole space but beautifully juxtaposed with a moment of rueful reflectiveness in one and a wry acknowledgement of the “noisy neighbours” in the other. It makes for a beautifully connected experience. Past and present, even future seem to co-exist as the three couples feed off each other even from their different stages, and the combined effect is to suggest that though these are scenes from a single marriage, they could be from every marriage, soul-searching, sadness and sandwiches lurking behind every door on the street. "
672,672,Ought To Be Clowns,21/08/2007,Ian,The Hothouse, National Theatre,"It is set in an undetermined institution, somewhere between mental institution and convalescent home I think, which is run by a staff who have more problems than those at Holby City and Casualty combined. When the governor decides to try and solve some of the problems when Christmas Day sees one inmate dying and another giving birth, it sets in chain a set of events that reveals how rotten each member of the staff is, no-one ends up being free from blame and an increasingly sinister tone leads to a bitter ending. We never see the inmates of the Hothouse, but we do hear the groans and screams, so the focus is on the twisted relations of the staff: the dark ambition of Finbar Lynch’s Gibbs, the keenness of Leo Bill’s unwitting Lamb and Lia Williams’ enigmatic and seductive Miss Cutts amongst others. The twisted take on the way archaic institutions are run is intermittently amusing but I didn’t laugh anywhere near as much as most everyone else. And once again, the familiar Pinter-esque touches just left me cold: as far as I’m concerned repetition is just repetition no matter who writes it."
673,673,Ought To Be Clowns,24/12/2018,Ian,Caroline or Change, Playhouse Theatre,"For the assiduous theatregoer, this is the third opportunity to catch this stirring Chichester Festival Theatre production of Caroline or Change. From its original run at the Minerva last year to the Hampstead Theatre this spring, this idiosyncratic musical now arrives in the West End in the relative intimacy of the Playhouse Theatre. And it is an intimacy that is needed to draw you into the true shape of Michael Longhurst’s production – to be confronted with that Confederate statue, the sweltering isolation of that basement, the knots of tension on furrowed brows. The winds of change may be starting to blow across the US of the early 1960s but here in this Louisiana household, societal change has yet to filter down to the individual.   It’s a work that almost defies explanation. Jeanine Tesori’s eclectic score binds together elements of gospel, soul, and blues with Motown harmonies and operatic tension. And Tony Kushner’s book weaves fantastical strands (Caroline’s appliances all sing with her) with hard-hitting tragedy as race and class fall under the microscope. Michael Longhurst’s production captures all of these contradictions beautifully, the revolve of Fly Davis’ design full of tragic momentum. And though there’s been some changes in the supporting cast, there’s outstanding work from Ako Mitchell, Naana Agyei-Ampadu and Aaron Gelkoff (at this performance) as Noah. Powerfully moving and a positive presence in the West End."
674,674,Ought To Be Clowns,11/05/2014,mag9l,Microcosm, Soho Theatre,"The most amusing part of James Perkins’ design for Matt Hartley’s Microcosm may be accidental or it could well be a nod to the sweltering heat that often builds up in the attic room of the Soho Theatre Upstairs. In the midst of moving flats on a hot summer’s day, one of the characters sets up a desktop fan, points it out towards the audience and switches it on – it may only offer comfort for a small group but in lieu of effective air-con, it is well played.  The flat belongs to Alex, recently purchased with an inheritance from a grandmother and long-term girlfriend Clare is moving in too. It may only be a conversion but it marks a major step for him in becoming lord of his own manor but he soon comes to realise that along with property comes neighbours. Some are benign, if overbearingly creepy, as in the relentless attentions of married Philip from next door but others are more ominous, like the small gang hanging out down the road – the show opens with the chirpy tones of ‘On The Street Where You Live’ which soon gains a double meaning. Hartley’s play navigates the emotional contours of Alex’s journey well, the heady excitement of home-owning slowly curdling as major dramas like using the wrong bins come to light. But his main thesis is how neighbourly concern can turn stalkerish – the initial main plot thrust of John Lightbody’s excellently gauche Philip developing a huge mancrush on Philip McGinley’s first-rate Alex, is neatly counterpointed by Alex’s growing obsession with fighting back against the youths who have started to victimise the newcomers. The varying extent to which these fixations are damaging is interestingly drawn – Clare (the highly charismatic Jenny Rainsford) is adamant that Alex is just poking the hornet’s nest by not leaving the whole thing well alone. And as his paranoia increases, not helped by the tacit acknowledgement from the police that there’s little he can really do with a nice turn from a kindly Christopher Brandon, the question of exactly what point we should, or even could intervene when one feels threatened becomes pressingly pertinent although Philip’s UKIP-baiting suggestions for what to do with the great unwashed is laughed off a little too easily.  It is a curious play, albeit one with little real dramatic surprise in it and Derek Bond’s production is well-conceived for the most part, the pedestrian scene changes being the only real disappointment. The corrugated plastic walls of Perkins’ design and Sally Ferguson’s lighting cleverly distort our view of exactly what is really happening outside, leaving us at the mercy of our possibly unreliable protagonist but there’s not quite enough reasoned debate to really engage us in a way that isn’t sadly predictable."
675,675,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2011,Ian,The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Gielgud,"‘A French romance that just happens to be sung’ is the subtitle to Kneehigh’s adaptation of the 1964 film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg which has arrived at the Gielgud Theatre, following their hugely successful take on Brief Encounter a couple of years ago. The story is boy meets girl, they fall in love but he gets called to national service in Algeria, but she is…well, I can’t give it all away, but it is a nicely mature look at the ebb and flow of love and romance which rarely runs as smoothly as we would all like. Perhaps predictably, the show is full of Kneehigh-isms, the tricks and stagecraft for which they have become so well-known, but perhaps with diminishing returns in this instance. We have finger-walking people, freaky puppet children, sailors carrying people around when they want to go somewhere, a man (badly) dragged up as the elderly aunt, a swish-looking video wall: all are professionally done, but hardly any of them feel genuinely part of the fabric of the show, an integral part of the story-telling and so consequently the feeling is often of ‘we know how to do it, so we will’. The video wall is really effective in the way it is employed but it is for the briefest of moments only and I couldn’t help wonder if the focus shouldn’t have been more on keeping the ticket prices down. There were strong performances onstage, Joanna Riding’s umbrella-purveyoring mother and Cynthia Erivo’s compassionate carer being glorious to listen to. And Meow Meow’s turn as compère Maîtresse, with her warm sending-up of all things French and indeed the musical format, is a great touch at trying to break down any initial reluctance there might be to surrendering to the world of a French through-sung musical. Plus her rendition of Sans Toi, borrowed from the film Cléo de 5 à 7 is as close to a show-stealer as anything in here, a wonderful moment of pensive magic. Carly Bawden’s Geneviève and Andrew Durand’s Guy play the young lovers with a nice fresh-faced sweetness and though they never quite scale the heights of le grand amour that might make for a greater poignancy, although this fits into the show’s grander message in the end, if one thinks about it."
676,676,Ought To Be Clowns,29/03/2010,Ian,Shirley Valentine, Menier Chocolate Factory,"Do two plays make a season? Regardless, the Menier Chocolate Factory have quite a coup in presenting the first London revivals of both Shirley Valentine and Educating Rita, playing in rep for six weeks as part of their Willy Russell season. For Shirley Valentine, Meera Syal takes the title role in this one-hander with aplomb and, in what will surely dominate every review, live onstage making and cooking of chips! Shirley Valentine is an ordinary Liverpudlian housewife. As she prepares chips and egg for her ungrateful husband, she muses on her life, talking to the wall about such subjects as the state of her marriage, her grown-up children, her past and the ambitions she harboured as a younger woman. These ruminations have been sparked by an intriguing offer she has received from a girlfriend to go with her on holiday to Greece in search of romance and adventure. It’s all extremely impressive stuff. Syal’s acting is superb, creating a whole world of characters with a range of voices, but crucially locating the gentle heart of Shirley, filled with an aching longing for something more than just wife and mother. Impressively, given it was written (and assumably set) in 1988, it doesn’t feel dated, Willy Russell’s writing remains funny and because it is so squarely focused on human relationships, it really does feel timeless. And despite being initially firmly located in Liverpool (the recently featured Adelphi hotel is mentioned), it is sufficiently universal for this not to be an issue. The attention to detail in the dressing of the set is an absolute treat. Being so close as you are in the new seats on the side at the Menier, very little escapes you and I was delighted to see, among other things, malt loaf in the bread bin, coconut macaroons in the cupboard and old-school glass bottles of coke in the fridge. Combined with the wonder of the chip-making, it’s a miracle I paid any attention to the acting! Without giving too much away, the set changes in the interval but becomes no less effective in reflecting the mood of the play. Credit must go to Ms Syal who adlibbed brilliantly when a bit of the stage cracked alarmingly as she stepped on it, she proved herself a real professional and a master of working an audience in allowing us our laughter and then pulling us straight back in with a killer line of great emotion. If one must be critical, then I have to admit that I struggled to buy Meera Syal as a working-class housewife in the first act: she just looks too beautiful and well, middle class! I thought perhaps more could have been done to make her look more downtrodden, as with Mel C in Blood Brothers. And her Scouse accent wavered somewhat down the M6 to Birmingham on occasion, but understandable given this was her second show and the number of other voices employed throughout the show. This production of Shirley Valentine comes highly recommended from me: it feels fresh and in no way dated, it’s both sharply funny and extremely moving in its portrayal of a woman finally fulfilling a lifetime of dreams and pursuing her own ambitions and happiness and Meera Syal’s fine performance ensures that we really do care what happens. Plus, she makes chips onstage, what more do you want! What about health and safety? ?? I'm sure the Menier has adequate insurance and I don't think anyone eats the food!"
677,677,Ought To Be Clowns,27/05/2016,mag9l,We Wait In Joyful Hope, Theatre503,"Brian Mullin’s first play as part of the 503Five Writer-in-Residence scheme is We Wait In Joyful Hope, directly inspired by his aunt, a nun who helped to found a successful NY women’s shelter. Thus the central character here is a nun who helped to found a women’s shelter, in New Jersey though, where it has been helping people for over 30 years. They say write about what you know but in this case, it does feel occasionally that Mullin could have done with a bit of distance to really make the drama work. For Sister Bernie D’Amato is an absolutely cracking character, played with intelligent and varied depth by Maggie McCarthy, but the play around her doesn’t quite match up. D’Amato is battling the spectre of gentrification as property buyers are wrecking the community, the patriarchy of the church hierarchy against whom she’s always had to fight and her own failing health too. But in among all this, Mullin rarely ventures out to deal with any of these larger themes on which he touches, there’s little that’s truly dramatic."

679,679,Ought To Be Clowns,28/09/2014,Ian,Speed-The-Plow, Playhouse Theatre,"When did we become a society so keen on a hot mess? I’m as guilty as anyone for finding guilty pleasure in (some of) the car crashes that increasingly clutter our television screens and if I protest that it’s only really the likes of Greg(g) Wallace I want to see make a fool of themselves on the dancefloor, one can equally argue that that is just the thin end of the wedge. Lindsay Lohan found herself very much at the deep end when the announcement that she would be making her stage debut in David Mamet’s Speed-The-Plow was first made, scepticism rather than enthusiasm being the prevailing tone, and the gleeful reports of a challenging first preview – which have been so incredibly widely reported (and again, I’m no innocent here) – would seem to indicate that many would like nothing more than to see her fall flat on her face. Whatever the perceived sins of a celebrity, it’s not a particularly good look on any of us, this baying for failure and so I thought I do my best to redress the balance a little. I caught the show on Saturday night (still in preview, opening night is this coming Thursday) to find that Richard Schiff was off sick and understudy Adam Morris would be playing Bobby Gould. Morris was impressively almost entirely off-book (he also performed the matinée that day) and it just goes to show the unpredictability of theatre work, something that any theatrical debutante would have to get used to, especially when a production is in such early days as these. That’s not to place anyone beyond reproach but merely a recognition that getting a play up and running with delayed starts, cast changes and all in the first week alone is no mean feat. The flipside is of course that the show is open to paying customers – and it sure ain’t cheap, top price goes up to a whopping £125 – and preview or not, you’re gonna want your money’s worth. And in terms of the raw material, the signs are good. Mamet’s 1988 biting study of the shark-infested waters of Hollywood film production remains as potent as it surely ever did (this is my first time seeing the show) as jobbing producer Charlie Fox hits up his old buddy Bobby Gould, a newly promoted studio boss, with a sure-fire formulaic blockbuster hit. The fly in the ointment is Bobby’s temporary secretary Karen who awakens something of an artistic conscience in him when she pitches passionately for a novel he’d tossed her way and so Bobby ends up caught between the two projects, torn between art and commerce. And you can see how Lindsay Posner’s production has the potential to become something powerfully hypnotic as the intricacies of Mamet’s wordplay combine with the tightness of the plotting. Adam Morris really was impressive stepping into the role of the conflicted Bobby (and whilst many would have been disappointed not to get the guy from The West Wing, I was hugely thrilled to get Robin Hood from Maid Marian and her Merry Men, one of my favourite TV shows as a kid). The ever-thrilling-to-watch Nigel Lindsay is blisteringly good as a near-animalistic Charlie, his swagger underscored with a real menace, and as for Lindsay Lohan, well she has a lovely stage presence when her nerves settle – the gorgeous ease of her body language and that inimitably rich alto convey real passion when she lets them – it would be fascinating to see her again later in the run."
680,680,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2013,Ian,Gruesome Playground Injuries, Gate,"The first thing to strike you as you enter the Gate for Gruesome Playground Injuries is Lily Arnold’s design. A jagged streak of clinical white bisects the theatre, Mariah Gale and Felix Scott already sit onstage, the traverse staging exposes half of the audience in this already intimate space. Rajiv Joseph’s intimately bruising two-hander initially sustains the premise that is promised by the visual ingenuity and its intriguing concept, but the writing runs out of steam before its 80 minutes are over and so ultimately proves a bit of a frustrating watch. Kayleen and Doug first meet aged 8 in the nurse’s room of their school – she’s got a sore tummy and he rode his bicycle off the roof of the school and a perverse attraction with each other’s sickness soon grows between the pair. We then trace their (not-)relationship through the next 30 years, jumping back and forth through time as they are repeatedly drawn together at key moments in their lives despite having drifted far apart in the intervening periods. Their encounters are almost always based around a new injury suffered by one but as Doug’s daredevil stunts continue with a horrific disregard for his own safety and Kayleen’s internal demons prevent her own happiness, it is clear that this is a vicious cycle of pain in which they are trapped. Justin Audibert directs the story with something of an indie-film aesthetic. The actors – Mariah Gale and Felix Scott – remain onstage throughout and so go through their multiple costume changes and painting-on of injuries in full view, to the tune of Isobel Waller-Bridge’s winsome music. It’s an effective choice at first but these extended scene changes begin to test the patience as it becomes apparent that Joseph’s writing suffers from excessively playing its one note, no matter the age of his characters. Instead of delving into psychological depth, he remains at a surface level which ends up perilously close to becoming twee.  There’s just too little to Kayleen and Doug to really draw us into their world and convince us of the strength of their relationship, having them be constantly drawn to one another over such a long period of time is a tough sell even without the lack of any real empathetic connection between them. There’s little sense of the ties that bind, to really convince that their sporadic visits to each other would have continued even with the gaps of several years between them.  And on a similar note, the final scene felt like a step too far, stretching the concept once again too thinly and for little real impact, given the power of the penultimate scene. As this moment occurred the day before one of the earlier scenes, it provided a pleasing circularity, illuminating a particular previous action and capturing perfectly both the depth and fragility of the emotion between the pair. "
681,681,Ought To Be Clowns,06/11/2010,Ian,Antony & Cleopatra, Liverpool Playhouse," Feisty yet graceful, powerful yet passionate, Cattrall’s portrayal is simply superb. A highly intelligent woman, one can see the calculations behind her eyes as she weighs up each decision that will affect her so hugely but she also plays the comedy well and her touching vulnerability when seized by thoughts of love is beautiful: the recollection of their salad days is exceptional. Kissoon’s Antony is clearly a relic of a passing age, moody and tinged with madness from the outset. His battles come from his uncertainty at his place in this world as much as they do from his doomed affair and so he is a more shambolic leader. Together they don’t quite radiate the sexual chemistry that one might have expected from these historic lovers but I rather liked this interpretation where it is evident that Cleopatra is more in love with the idea of being in love with Antony and how the reality doesn’t always match up to the fantasy. Indeed Cattrall’s performance is never finer than the end, when irrevocably separated from her lover, she chooses oblivion over servitude to Caesar. Ian Hogg’s Enobarbus is a marvellous piece of work, a subtle and gentle but masterful performance which is just riveting, almost scene-stealingly good; equally outstanding for me was Martin Jutson’s jittery Caesar who has the instantly recognisable slippery demeanour of a modern politician and bringing with it a greater sense of comedy to the role than I ever recall seeing. I also enjoyed Aïcha Kossoko and Gracy Goldman as a gracefully comic Charmian and Iris but the decision to cast Mark Sutherland as Octavia, whilst a movingly portrayed interpretation, did jar a little though as a decision which felt unconnected to the vision of the production as a whole.  Peter McKintosh’s set works well in its sparseness and simplicity, a modern glass and red brick set with metal bridge is dressed with practical modernity for Rome and a gorgeous opulence of silver lanterns and fabrics making an effective switch to the Egyptian scenes, costumes are modern-classical, couture gowns, pinstripe suits and military uniforms and Peter Pyant’s lighting enhances everything with some truly excellent work."

683,683,Ought To Be Clowns,12/09/2015,mag9l,See What I Wanna See, Jermyn Street,"After directing its European amateur premiere back in 2006, Adam Lenson now presents the London debut of Michael John LaChiusa’s See What I Wanna See at the Jermyn Street Theatre. Formally challenging and musically experimental, this modern musical is based on three short stories by Japanese writer Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, all circling around the elusive nature of truth and how faith and deception can shift and skew its perspective. Set in Medieval Japan, the opening tale of Kesa and Morito is split in two, acting as a prologue to both acts as a pair of lovers come to the end of a tumultuous relationship. R Shomon fast-forwards to a film noir version of 1951 New York where a murder has been committed but multiple versions of what happened are muddying the picture. And in Gloryday, a disillusioned priest in 2002 New York sees a hoax snowball way out of his control.  LaChiusa offers no easy answers – sometimes the big questions just don’t have them – but equally isolates his audience. The deliberately disquieting musical constantly shifts from jazz-like discordance to strident balladry through a whole range of influences which makes it hard to engage with, even as it is well played by the four-strong band with Richard Bates leading from the keys. R Shomon in particular seems more concerned with being densely tricksy than anything else. By comparison, Gloryday succeeds more in bringing heart to the storytelling, anchored by an excellent performance from Jonathan Butterell as the priest who cynically predicts Christ will rise in Central Park but is thoroughly unprepared for the reaction from people around him, especially in a post 9/11 context. Notions of how we see what we want to see regardless of what is happening echo strongest here – Sarah Ingram’s astute Aunt Monica standing out – but it does feel a long time coming."

685,685,Ought To Be Clowns,19/05/2011,Ian,One Man Two Guvnors, National Theatre,"I’ve spoken before about the unwiseness of booking for shows that you don’t fancy even though they have very appealing casts and that goes double when it is a form of theatre that you know you can’t stand. Yet despite this, I still booked a pair of £12 tickets for One Man, Two Guvnors at the Lyttelton in the vain hope that I might be won over. For as you may or may not know, farce is one of my least favourite styles of theatre, I rarely find it funny, though I have tried, but this is compounded here by the casting of James Corden in the central role, a man whose ubiquity and public persona I find most objectionable. So why on earth did I book? Good question, but it was in the interests of trying to keep my theatrical experiences as broad as possible, the promise of a wonderful sounding supporting cast and the intriguing addition of songs by Grant Olding being introduced into the mix. Based on the Italian comedy The Servant of Two Masters by Carlo Goldoni, Richard Bean has relocated the play to 1960s Brighton, thus mixing its commedia dell’arte origins with a British sitcom sensibility and augmented by the ever-present in-house band The Craze who provide musical entertainment before the show starts and during the interval as well as interspersing the action. The plot, for what it’s worth, concerns Francis Henshall, a (assumedly) cheeky chappy who’s down on his luck with no money and a huge appetite. He falls into a job as a minder for a gangster Roscoe Crabbe who is in town to collect £6,000 and then as chance would have it, he gets a second job working for a guy called Stanley Stubbers who is staying in the same hotel. But all is not what it seems: Roscoe is actually his twin sister Rachel in disguise as Roscoe was murdered by her boyfriend and she wants to collect the money to run away with her beloved, who just happens to be Stanley who is in hiding from the police. This being a farce, Francis then has to keep the two from discovering each other though they are staying in the same pub as he wants to keep the two pay packets and thus be able to eat and get his end away. Perhaps sadly if predictably, I was really not a fan of it. From the moment the fourth wall was broken in the opening scene and the audience participation hinted at, it was clear that this was not going to be the show that redefined my attitude towards this genre. And maybe it is tied up with my preconceptions about Corden, but I did find him to be the main obstacle to my enjoyment – indeed there were moments when he was not onstage where I was in danger of cracking a smile. It feels like Nicholas Hytner has employed the lightest of touches in directing Corden and so his performance really does come off as an extension of his ostensibly lovable everyman shtick rather than the creation of a new character, he treats it almost like a stand-up show which does not work and suggests a laziness in his approach. Given the laughter and applause that surrounded me – even his first entrance onstage was whooped – this was not the popular assessment and maybe I ought to be more charitable given that this was a preview performance, but it is the National Theatre we are talking about and crucially, Corden was shown up by the ensemble around him who had a much keener sense of how to play the comedy as an integral part of the fabric of the show. Suzie Toase in particular was just fabulous at breaking the fourth wall, a real sense of taking the audience into her confidence, and it was her character Dolly that benefitted most from the temporal relocation, her working woman in the time of early Women’s Lib was like a breath of fresh air. Another problem I had was with the constant overplaying of the humour. Every gag whether verbal or visual are stretched out and repeated or replayed so that even the funniest of moments began to flag at the third and fourth, if not more, iteration. Oliver Chris’ ridiculous public schoolboy utterances were largely very funny but instead of remaining inventive, relied too much on repetition although his delivery was spot on throughout and he was one of the production’s saving graces. Along with Jemima Rooper’s man-drag as Rachel/Roscoe, they anchored the show with a dramatic validity that allowed the comedy in their own performances and around them to flow freely in the (Corden-free) ensemble. Claire Lams does a fine job as the perma-confused Pauline, thoroughly befuddled by life but utterly besotted with Alan, whose hilarious thespian posturings are great; Fred Ridgeway and Martyn Ellis are also fun as their respective fathers as was Trevor Laird’s kindly Lloyd – all had their comic moments and all were forced to deliver them over and over again – there is just no sophistication in the writing: plus the word fluff is used in a bizarre coincidence as it was the very same word that was my least favourite thing about The Cherry Orchard, also currently playing at the National. The best part of the show for me was Grant Olding’s music. A set of 60s pastiches, Buddy Holly-like songs that peppered the play but also, brilliantly, allowed musical interludes of a simply bizarre diversity from the cast members during scene changes (the girl group was my favourite though the horns and chest slapping were also fab). What this implied to me though was the tacit recognition that the play itself was not strong enough to stand on its own, it needs this bolstering which does inject considerable energy into the production. I didn’t care for Mark Thompson’s flimsy set; I found the audience stuff completely unnecessary; though I am sometimes a fan of unchallenging, easy humour, it never really connected with me here, the geriatric waiter stuff was just painful; but most importantly and somewhat ironically for someone who rose to fame as part of a Hytner-directed ensemble, Corden does not feel an organic part of this production. Perhaps this will come by opening night though I personally doubt it, but then when there were people ovating around me, it is clear I am very much in the minority here. This comment has been removed by the author. Don't you love farce? Evidently not, and I agree it's an acquired taste: I can find nothing funny in Ben Travers or Boeing-Boeing, but they're amazingly popular.  This had the parodic flavour of 'Noises Off' for me, and I suspect may do as well. Appreciate your thoughtful review, even if I did have a whale of a time the previous night myself and a bit of audience interaction with Corden …  http://johnnyfoxlondon.blogspot.com/2011/05/in-which-i-take-it-all-back-and.html … I think the combination of a capable Hytner production and Corden's massive television fan base will mean sellouts and transfers without much interference from the critics, but I'll be fascinated to see what the print boys make of it. I have to say I completely disagree with you! The way you've reviewed it shows me you're taking it all too seriously (:P), you obviously didn't get swept up in the humour (this happened to me at Becky Shaw, everyone else was laughing and I was stony-faced) – thus seeing Dolly as something more than a device, I think! My fault, I fear… Interesting to read positive reviews coming from doubters and like you Johnny, I have no idea how it will be received critically (not that it will make any difference!) And 'M', disagreement is fine, comedy is one of those things that easily divides people. But I must take exception to your assertion that I was taking it all too seriously. That is not the case at all, I just didn't find it funny, these are two different things. This is not where my sense of humour lies, it is fine that people find someone being repeatedly hit by a door amusing, I just do not (there are countless more examples but I don't want to spoil them). But more importantly, on the occasions where I was actually amused, I soon became tired as the humour is constantly repeated (Oliver Chris' Boys-Own-isms for example, I liked them til they were re-used)"
686,686,Ought To Be Clowns,27/01/2018,Ian,Girl From The North Country, Noël Coward,"After a hugely successful run at the Old Vic, Girl From The North Country transfers to the Noël Coward with the majority of its cast and all of its melancholy soul intact. Seeing Sheila Atim transform ‘Tight Connection To My Heart’ into the most heartfelt of laments was one of my highlights of 2017 and seeing it once again made me feel like it could easily be one of the highlights of 2018 as well. Her performance is symptomatic of what makes this show so fantastic. The secret weapon in Conor McPherson’s production is the arrangement of the Bob Dylan songs by Simon Hale, an interpretative masterstroke which weaves the music into the very fabric of these people’s lives. (Though whether that makes this a musical remains anyone’s guess.) Straight renditions of the songs are magnificent, as in Shirley Henderson’s ‘Like a Rolling Stone’ and Jack Shalloo’s ‘Dusquesne Whistle’, but arrangements for multiple voices really shine like Sam Reid and Claudia Jolly’s incandescent duet on ‘I Want You’ and the three female voices that give us a fleeting snippet of’ To Make You Feel My Love’. And the patchwork effect of threading echoes of ‘I Want You’ through the reprise of ‘Like A Rolling Stone’ further amplify the pure emotion of the music. The show has transferred into the West End well (here’s m’review from last time), feeling perhaps even more intimate here within a smaller proscenium arch. New key cast members Finbar Lynch (in for Michael Shaeffer’s Reverend Marlowe), David Ganly (in for Stanley Townsend’s Mr Burke) and Adam James (in for Ron Cook’s narrator figure Dr Cook) have all blended in well, and it is good to see Emmanuel Kojo onstage again though I do wish it were a bigger part for him."
687,687,Ought To Be Clowns,23/03/2015,mag9l,Radiant Vermin, Soho Theatre,"The struggles of home ownership seem to be emerging as one of the most popular themes of new plays for early 2015 (Game at the Almeida, Deposit at the Hampstead downstairs) but top of the pile is Philip Ridley’s Radiant Vermin, a highly hilarious and hugely successful sidestep towards the mainstream but one which sacrifices nothing of the unique worldview that marks him as one of our most thought-provoking playwrights. Almost custom-designed to fit into that much abused term ‘darkly comic’, the play probes mercilessly into the depths of human nature in asking how far would we go in order to get our dream home.  As it turns out, Jill and Ollie – energetic, enthusiastic, expecting – will go to some lengths indeed, making a deal not quite with the devil but with the fairy godmother-like Miss Dee instead, to accept a free home in a scuzzy area with the hope of renovating it, tipping the locale over into up-and-coming status and spearheading a property boom. So far so Saturday Night Takeaway but as with Ant and Dec, there’s a catch (and it is not just their personalities). The young couple quickly find out that that the speediest way to do up their new house is to harness the “radiance” that comes from killing the vermin around them, namely the homeless people from the neighbouring wasteground.  The scene seems set to descend into a typical Ridley-esque dystopian darkness but that dip never comes. Instead, the tone remains bright and bitingly sharp, fiercely funny even as the ugliness of the nakedly avaricious pursuit of the consumerist dream is fully laid bare. And in the hands of frequent Ridley collaborators as these, the spikiness and surrealism hits home with the kind of force party political broadcasts dream of having. On the blank canvas of William Reynolds’ well-lit set, David Mercatali’s precisely but perfectly pitched production allows a frankly anarchic sense of play to spill forth and utterly entrance the audience. "
688,688,Ought To Be Clowns,27/02/2016,mag9l,Simon Lipkin, Jon Robyns and Giles Terera,"Avenue Q is a show that I loved with all of my heart when it arrived in the West End, making seven trips across the four years of its various cast and theatre changes. And though I have enjoyed the touring versions that have emerged since, there’s nothing quite like the original and so the news that Lipkin and Robyns would be bringing along Princeton, Nicky, Rod and Trekie Monster along with them was music to my ears, YAYYY as the Bad Idea Bears might have said! And what a fun evening it was. The affection that these guys have for each other, and for musical theatre, was evident from the off in a couple of parody numbers poking fun at the industry in which they’ve all managed to establish enduring careers – with lows as well as highs, I Can’t Sing anyone? And the second half saw their playful sides kick in with a witty ‘Fly Me To The Moon’ sung one word at a time by the three of them and a raucous ‘Jailhouse Rock’ seeing them switch between piano, tambourine and lead vocal every time an audience member honked a horn. Solo sections for each offered up real delights. Terera – my Best Actor in a Musical from last year and currently doing great things to Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom – more than proved his worth with a gorgeously jazzy ‘Pure Imagination’ and a hugely affecting, low-key ‘Tomorrow’ from Bugsy Malone. Robyns looked back to Memphis with a rousing The Music of my Soul from the piano and Lipkin thoroughly indulged his comic chops, though stood out most with the quiet emotion of William Finn’s aching ‘I’d Rather Be Sailing’ and a lovely rendition of ‘The Rainbow Connection’ along with Terera, their harmonies sending lovely shivers down the spine. An unexpected high point of the show was Terera’s impersonation of Dame Judi Dench’s ‘Send in the Clowns’, right down to the shoulder (and not just because the song contains a shout-out to the name of this blog, or should that be the other way round…!) which was fortunately good enough to avoid being a treasonable offence. But as we were blessed with a trio of songs from the show that made at least two of their names, it was thoroughly fantastic to be reminded just how much I loved Avenue Q and how much I loved these guys doing the show. From ‘If You Were Gay’ (I’M NOT BEING DEFENSIVE!) to the harmonies of ‘I Wish I Could Go Back To College’ to the hard-earned wisdom of ‘For Now’, it was all I hoped it would be and more or less the perfect end to a cracking evening of cabaret, with sterling support from Musical Director Alex Williams on the piano. You kinda hope that this is the first of many times that the hugely musically talented Lipkin, Robyns and Terera do this sort of thing as their stars, both collective and individual, deserve to continue to rise and rise."
689,689,Ought To Be Clowns,21/07/2015,mag9l,The Invisible, Bush Theatre,"Rebecca Lenkiewicz’s new drama The Invisible finds itself caught between two stools really – nominally a play about the effects of the decimating cuts to the Legal Aid system, it tries so hard not to be full of such dry legalese, instead focusing on the lives of the people who would use it – who desperately need it – that it almost goes too far in becoming something else entirely. Sponsored by The Law Society as it is with a supporting leaflet giving facts and figures, it’s thus a surprise that this is how it plays out. At the heart of it all in Gail, an overworked solicitor working in a London law centre that is being threatened with closure due to Coalition cuts and from her spins the spider-web of stories. Like the Irishman who can’t pay his bills, or the Pakistani housewife being abused by her husband and mother-in-law. Gail tries to find some respite in online dating but even there she’s tracked down by a man looking for free legal advice – Lenkiewicz leaves us in no doubt as to just how many people have relied on this service and now find themselves in dire straits. But ultimately she does focus too much on them and the minutiae of their lives. Impressively portrayed by the wonderful Alexandra Gilbreath, Gail’s worldview is never challenged and whilst I don’t think many would agree with these cuts, there’s no substantial intellectual interrogation of what it really means to her or the wider world outwith these people here. The situation is illuminated by Lenkiewicz’s writing but more elucidation is also needed to drive the message home more forcefully."
690,690,Ought To Be Clowns,27/03/2011,Ian,Sunday Morning at the Centre of the World, Southwark Playhouse,"On entering the Vault at Southwark Playhouse, a man in a grey tracksuit offers you a furry purple blindfold. ‘It’s your choice to wear it…’ he says, how could you refuse?! Sunday Morning at the Centre of the World is the only play that Louis de Bernières has written but it is a play for voices, originally broadcast as it was on Radio 3 and that is where the blindfold comes in. Bad Physics’ production offers the opportunity to experience it as a radio play, listening to the dialogue but with added sensory experiences, live sound effects, smells and sensations or you can choose to watch the cast perform these sensory interventions and experience it without the element of surprise. The show is an homage to the author‘s life in Earlsfield, South West London and takes direct influence from Dylan Thomas’ Under Milk Wood in its device of an omnipresent narrator inviting us to witness and eavesdrop on the everyday life as he has observed it in Tooting. The cast of eight play a multitude of characters from a wide range of the social spectrum giving a rich slice of the diversity of this community, which like so many communities, is having to deal with changes that have and are continuing to take place. The characterisations sometimes tend towards the broadly stereotypical but only because so many stereotypes are based in truth and the cast never loses sight of the humanity of even the wackier traits of behaviour being portrayed here. I managed about 25 minutes with the blindfold on but my need to lip-read, especially in the rather echoey chamber of the Vault, led me to watch rather than experience the latter part of the show and it was really interesting to be able to take in both possibilities. There’s great fun in watching the actors working at creating the soundscape, sometimes using unusual objects, and seeing the reactions of the blindfolded participants as they react to whichever stimulation they are being subjected to. But it does take away the element of gentle surprise which is the best thing about it, especially when it comes to the smells, it just isn’t the same when you can see someone approaching you with a piece of Tupperware!"
691,691,Ought To Be Clowns,05/05/2013,Ian,Ghost the musical, New Wimbledon,"Given the fortunes of its replacement at the Piccadilly Theatre, the 15 month West End run of Ghost the musical doesn’t seem too bad at all in the end. Based on the famous 1990 film with book by Bruce Joel Rubin and music from Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard, the story of psychics, possession and pottery certainly looked impressive in Matthew Warchus’ cinematically flash production but this wasn’t always enough to overcome the shortcomings of its adaptation. But it was a show that intrigued and one that I came to like quite a lot (I saw it twice – reviews can be read here and here but the first review of the show on here, from its original Manchester run, comes courtesy of my father!) and so I was certainly intrigued to catch it at the New Wimbledon Theatre as it sets out on a major UK tour. The main difference comes with the blessed removal of the heinous song and dance routine ‘Ball of Wax’. I’m not sure that tap dancing ghosts have any place in the world but they really stood out like a sore thumb in the original show with their misguided appearance coming at an appallingly bad time, right after Sam’s death and shattering any poignancy that might have been built up. Now, we get a much mellower song called ‘You Gotta Let Go’ (first introduced on Broadway) which serves the same purpose of getting him acquainted with his new status in the afterlife. Other changes are subtler and by and large, the show feels rather akin to its West End predecessor. Which means the structural issues of the story remain. Between setting up the story of the enduring romance with all its travails and the third-wheel presence of Carl, there’s not really enough time spent on Sam and Molly’s relationship before it is ended – on this plain at least – to really make us buy into the strength of their love and keep us invested in their fate. Without the background of the film, it just wouldn’t stand up as a conceit and it would take an extraordinarily gifted actor in the role of Sam to make it work. Stewart Clarke sounds like a dream and certainly looks the part with his ripped abs but never quite manages to elevate the part in the way that is required and to be honest, I don’t think any of the actors I have seen cover the role have really solved this inherent weakness. But Rebecca Trehearn as Molly, who understudied the role in the West End, plays the emotional centre of the play with passion and grace as she struggles to work through her uncomprehending grief and her glorious vocal is well suited to the powerhouse ballads like the gorgeous ‘With You’. And in the other key role, Wendy Mae Brown’s Oda Mae Brown is a vivacious treat, Whoopi Goldberg memorably won an Oscar for her turn in the film, and her arrival is a much-needed shot in the arm for the first act and an amusing highlight of the second. But it is hard to shake the feeling that many of the ensemble scenes, with their slo-mo choreography from Ashley Wallen, are a tad extraneous – the representations of hectic urban life add little of real benefit to the show, although they do interact extremely well with John Driscoll’s video and projection work which in turn mesh well with Rob Howell’s expertly fast-changing set and Paul Kieve’s nifty illusion work. "
692,692,Ought To Be Clowns,21/06/2010,Ian,The Tempest, Bridge Project at Old Vic,"The Bridge Project, a transatlantic company of actors performing two classic plays in rep directed by Sam Mendes, returns to the Old Vic for its second year after playing numerous venues across the world. After a well-received double-bill of The Cherry Orchard and The Winter’s Tale last year, there’s a greater focus on Shakespeare with As You Like It partnering The Tempest. This is a somewhat low-key interpretation of Shakespeare’s final play. Played in modern dress, it tells of Prospero, usurped as Duke of Milan by his own brother and cast out to sea with his infant daughter Miranda. Shipwrecked on a mysterious island full of magical knowledge, 12 years pass until he is able to confront his enemies aided and abetted by his enslaved island creatures Ariel and Caliban and through a masterful display of control-freakery, manipulate most everyone he deals with into achieving his own aims. Christian Camargo’s Ariel is a delightfully nuanced performance, quietly musical even when not singing and portrayed in a flexibly androgynous way: slipping between shirtless suits, elegant evening wear and a striking set of avenging angel wings with ease. A different Ariel but one which convinced and I very much enjoyed Camargo’s interpretation. And I quite liked Dillane’s pensive, ambivalent, all-too-human Prospero too, less of a wizard and more of a man, so adept at playing the long game he has forgotten how to feel passion yet still wryly quite funny. Together their scenes are excellent, a close chemistry between the two and some mirroring of gestures which was a small, but beautifully observed touch. It’s not that there are any bad performances per se in the rest of the ensemble, although Jonathan Lincoln Fried looked quite uncomfortable, it’s just it is all quite measured, verging on the ponderous. Good quality acting rather than great and so one ends up longing for more interjections from the likes of Juliet Rylance’s Miranda and Edward Bennett’s Ferdinand, both of whom speak beautifully in the illuminating discovery of their passion and Alvin Epstein’s tender, honest Gonzalo. At times, even in the more comic scenes or the traitorous actions of the noblemen, it is so calm it is dangerously close to being dull. Creatively, it looks and sounds beautiful. Stephen Bentley-Klein and Shane Shanahan provide a lush soundscape, with music and sound effects filling the theatre from their stations either side of the stage, Tom Piper’s set design has book-filled nooks and crannies at the front where Prospero is often found reading or taking notes throughout all the scenes, an artfully bare wall at the back vividly lit by Paul Pyant, changing from a deep earthy red for Caliban and an airy turquoisy blue for Ariel. But the focus is centred around a magic circle on the stage: filled with sand, all the action happens in here, Prospero manipulates his players within, observing impatiently without. It is a clever device, simple but highly effective: initially it seemed a little hokey, but soon proved its worth in the opening shipwreck scene and ultimately provides the one truly moving moment at the play’s close. Sure there’s a couple of unnecessary touches, one sound effect which sounded just like someone slurping a drink (I checked behind me, they weren’t) and the home video played at the wedding just felt wrong to me. And given that a considerable portion of Shakespeare’s language has been trimmed, a fair bit of time is given over to wordless dance sequences. Altogether it amounts to a little bit of a damp squib, a solid three star show rising to a four in its final quarter. Given my recent disappointments at the Old Vic, and indeed the Old Vic tunnels (I’m really not having a good time this year with this theatre!), it rated quite well, but when one compares it to the previous Bridge Project plays, it is hard not to be underwhelmed. As a production, it seems ill-suited to its company and fails to play to their strengths; I hope As You Like It is a better fit. The breaking of the spell at the end was a real hairs-on-end moment for me, I loved it. Mostly agree with your review about how reserved the whole thing was, I just wanted them to break free and loose a bit more. Oh well, AYLI is much better. I have to agree that As You Like It felt by far the superior production and as you say, a much better company piece. Dillane just doesn't feel right here. WANTED.  For crimes against the audience. Stephen Dillane. The worst Prospero I have ever seen. Truly. Breath-takingly. Self-indulgent.  I will NEVER pay money to see this actor again. Hee hee, I'd already booked for the Master Builder at the Almeida so hopefully he'll be better in a smaller space…"
693,693,Ought To Be Clowns,04/09/2015,mag9l,As You Like It, Shakespeare’s Globe,"From the minute Michelle Terry’s Rosalind launches into an actual tizzy at the sight of Orlando’s ripped body (an inordinately but irresistibly muscular Simon Harrison), the warmly joyous spirit of Blanche McIntyre’s As You Like It is never in doubt. The contrasting textures of Shakespeare’s elegant yet complex comedy are well balanced, its musical elements pushed to the forefront with a folkish score from Johnny Flynn but above all, there’s a sense of intelligent fun that delights in taking its time to reveal itself. Terry has been establishing herself as one of our leading Shakespeareans and this energetic and impulsive take on Rosalind is an absolute privilege to watch. Constantly on the edge of her emotions, she skips from the giddy heights of love at first sight to the crushing pain of banishment in the blink of an eye. And as she explores the nature of love and the heart, her heart in particular, her deftly comedic manner whilst disguised as Ganymede is just glorious, her continual delight at what she is discovering a constant joy.  This is no one-woman show though, McIntyre encourages performances of depth and daring from all her company. James Garnon’s sardonic Jacques provides a revelatory ‘All the world’s a stage’ which toyed with the audience perfectly, Daniel Crossley’s bright-eyed Touchstone is as quick at talking as he is unexpectedly tap-dancing and always funny with it, Ellie Piercey’s Celia complements Terry perfectly with a graceful older sister vibe that can’t help but be swept along by the exuberance, and Sophia Nomvete’s Audrey is a scene-stealing delight."
694,694,Ought To Be Clowns,24/10/2010,Ian,Red Bud, Royal Court,"Slotting in upstairs at the Royal Court, Red Bud is a play by upcoming American writer Brett Neveu. Five friends make their annual trip to a motorcycle championship in southern Michigan but more than twenty years down the line, the attraction is beginning to wear thin, middle-aged concerns are taking over from high school dreams and not even copious quantities of alcohol and dope can paper over the cracks that have developed in their friendship. This is a review of a preview performance. Initially full of the forced bonhomie, banalities and those easy recollections of the past that are the fallback of people who have drifted apart, the paper-thin veneer of this camaraderie is severely challenged by the introduction of a raft of drinking games from their youth which quickly darkens the mood as tensions rise to the fore, brutal truths are revealed and frustrations worked out as the evening degenerates into bitterness and violence. It is very well done starting off with an amusingly effective stunt and playing out the fast-unravelling scenario resulting in some convincing fight sequences and great use of fake blood given how exposed the actors are in this set-up. Practically unrecognisable from his Scott Neal-seducing days on The Bill, Hywel Simons is most effective as the unemployed Jason whose fervent enthusiasm for the trip can’t mask the fact there’s little else in his life that is working for him and I liked Trevor White’s Bill, ostensibly the most sensible of the group with his steady job as a fireman but acting out in his own way dating nineteen-year-old girls. But it is Peter McDonald’s alpha male that demands the attention with a fierce performance of shocking intensity and controlled fury which goes about as dark as anything I’ve seen this year, especially when contrasted with Lisa Palfrey’s assured turn as his seven months pregnant wife Jen. He is genuinely menacing as the disaffected Greg, terrified at the prospect of fatherhood and seemingly hell-bent on self-destruction: he can also put away a huge amount of liquid as he ends drinking so much, I certainly wouldn’t want to be up against him in a drinking challenge! The space upstairs has been reconfigured into the round, the floor fully turfed, a pick-up truck in the corner, tents scattered around and the makings of a campfire in the middle. It’s an effective design from Tom Hadley although they may have overdone it slightly on the aroma; the grass smell as you walk in is almost enough to give you hay fever! Jon Clark’s naturalistic lighting matches the darkening tone of the play well and I loved the attention to detail with the Wal-Mart shopping bags and genuine US groceries. Neveu’s play doesn’t have anything particularly new to say, the frustrations of middle age and dashed expectations have been well explored by many others but there’s something about the timing of Red Bud which lends its disillusionment with today’s society a deeper resonance. His dialogue is well crafted and given great voice by a strong ensemble and given its short running time, it is remarkable how the production manages to whip up such tense emotion: I don’t think I actually breathed during the final 10 minutes! Thought it was good, but unnecessarily full of swearing as almost every play at the Royal Court seems to be these days. i thought it was brilliant, and having been to red bud twice, thought the way they brought the atmosphere and passion for the event across was as close to reality as they could have got!!very well done!! But as you say, it really doesn't have anything new to say. I enjoyed it while it lasted but it didn't stay in my head for very long.And what was that prosthetic penis? I've never seen one that look like that!!"
695,695,Ought To Be Clowns,28/05/2010,Ian,The Crucible, Open Air Theatre,"It really is a good time to be an Arthur Miller fan in London: All My Sons is receiving rave reviews at the Apollo Theatre and now you can see The Crucible at the Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre in a chilling new production of a play. The Puritans of Salem, Massachusetts are shocked when a group of their young girls are caught dancing in the woods and one of them falls into a coma. Accusations of witchcraft soon start to fly and as the hysteria mounts and a full-blown witch-hunt ensues, vendettas about land and money, and also of the heart, are pursued sub rosa as events snowball to a shockingly brutal conclusion. The struggle between truth and righteousness, between protecting self-interest and rising to the need of the greater good, is personified in the Proctor family, John and Elizabeth. Although written at the time of the McCarthyite anti-American witch-hunts, much of what it concerns struck me as so relevant to us today. The rampant intolerance, the “you’re either with us or against us” mentality, the dangers of social groups coming together to defend their interests against all others, even the struggles of John and Elizabeth to communicate effectively as husband and wife, all remain pertinent even as it is presented to us in seventeenth century dress.  It helps of course that it has been cast extremely well, Patrick O’Kane’s wild-haired John Proctor suggests some of Christopher Eccleston’s level of intensity, fiercely independent but plagued by the conflicting desires to save his wife but also to do the right thing, finally finding serenity in his ultimate decision. Emma Cunniffe is super, playing Goodie Proctor with a tightly coiled restraint marked by sudden bursts of passion or grief that are all the more effective for their unexpectedness And Bettrys Jones as Mary Warren, the Proctors’ maid whose testimony could sway the outcome of the entire accusation of witchcraft is also excellent with a convincing performance. The company of girls from the East15 acting school do a great job as vengeful observers throughout the majority of the play, sat around the edge of the stage their combined influence is quite chilling, as they turn and point to the individual women who are accused, chanting names in a very sinister manner and in the courtroom scene when they fall under the ‘influence’ of Mary Warren, their collective hysteria is genuinely disturbing. Led by the merciless Abigail Williams, played here with a vicious stone-facedness by Emily Taaffe, I’m quite glad I saw it in the daytime as they’re not girls you’d want to meet in the dark! There is a real sense of the enormity of what is happening and the creeping realisation that things are going too far, explicitly through Philip Cumbus’ appalled Reverend Hale but also displayed brilliantly by two of the more minor supporting roles. Paul Kemp as Ezekiel Cheever and Gary Milner as Marshall Herrick both did excellently in recognising the horror of what they were complicit in doing but also the futility of trying to stop it, painfully exemplified through the physical deterioration wrought on Susan Engel’s Rebecca Nurse. It’s also evident even in Taaffe’s anguish as Proctor is led to prison, her twisted games have finally gone too far. The staging is simple, the floor is actually the front wall of a house and little touches like a bed (which ruined my sightline for the first scene) and a cauldron rise up periodically. Striving for historical accuracy with the multitude of accents that would have still persisted in the still relatively newly established settlement is a step I would have avoided as it is really quite distracting for the larger part of the first half, you just have no idea what each new character is going to sound like. And a couple of the townsmen over-egged their accusatory scenes, a little more subtlety might not have gone amiss there. A friend of mine went the night before and after comparing notes, we agreed that you should definitely go and see this at night-time. The flaming torches sound perfect and although the atmosphere was wonderfully tense even in the blazing sunshine of the matinee, it can only be enhanced by watching this as the sun goes down. Whilst not the five-star success that is All My Sons (but then again, I don’t think anything else I see this year will be), I’d definitely give this a worthy four stars and if the weather holds out for you, a lovely way to spend a warm early summer evening. Couldn't agree more. Went to see this at night last week and the growing darkness really does add something special to the play. It really was fantastic. And you can't go wrong with the £5 cheap seats at the back! Have to say I saw this at Press Night tonight – and found some of the casting hideous, and the shocking direction of the second act makes this a 3* show at best! The actor playing John Proctor was appalling so many accents and some bad choices in delivery meant that the man we should sympathise with at the end of Act Two is nothing but another towns-person! Such a shame as the visuals of the set and the atmosphere of the theatre itself is stunning! Have to say I thought John Proctor was horribly miscast. He's meant to be a strong character, but was actually played as a weak man with a dodgy accent that at times sounded like a OTT Woody Allen impression. Other than that the play was great. I agree. This was an extraordinarily wonderful production. Truly mesmerizing, but in a brilliantly disturbing way."
696,696,Ought To Be Clowns,30/12/2011,Ian,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Radio 4,"Following on from the less than sucessful adaptation of Goldfinger that left me cold, I was a little trepidatious about listening to this production of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, especially as it soon came to light that it also featured narration – one of the things I disliked most about the Bond play – but it actually proved to be much more engaging and thoughtful, and ultimately considerably more entertaining. Linda Marshall Griffiths’ dramatisation has taken a fresh new look at the story, returning to L Frank Baum’s source novel and thereby casting off much of the baggage that might have come otherwise from just being a straight run of the film. What we get then, is a highly atmospheric story, partly told by Amelia Clarkson’s excellent Dorothy as part of an inner monologue, which feels darker and more compelling that one might have expected. It is all largely recognisable, but it felt so much fresher here and interesting too. Emma Fielding was great value for money as all of the female characters, and Kevin Eldon, Burn Gorman and Zubin Varla all did well as the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman and Lion respectively. And Clarkson captured the right note of youthful gumption to make Dorothy a thoroughly likeable heroine."
697,697,Ought To Be Clowns,01/03/2017,mag9l,Ugly Lies The Bone, National,"There’s a moment to catch the breath in the opening scene of Lindsey Ferrentino’s Ugly Lies The Bone as Kate Fleetwood’s Jess removes the virtual reality helmet she’s been wearing to reveal substantial scarring across half her face (excellent prosthetic work from the creative team). Jess is a veteran of three tours of Afghanistan, the last cut short by a close encounter with an IED that ravaged her body, whose recovery process after fourteen months in a hospital bed is not necessarily being aided by a return home to the depressed Florida town where she grew up. What is proving effective is a pioneering form of virtual reality-based therapy (based on real life) that is designed to help Jess manage the constant pain that her injuries cause. In a custom computer-generated world, she is liberated, if only momentarily from excruciating skin grafts and flashbacks and an understandable heaviness of spirit that claws its way back to the surface as soon as the helmet comes off. For in the real world, the end of NASA’s shuttle programme has left Titusville a shadow of the place it once was, making it even harder to reconnect with the sister and ex-lover she finds there. Though there’s real truth in the struggles of readjusting to small-town living no matter your circumstances, Ferrentino doesn’t quite mine deep enough into this mundaneness to say anything. Olivia Darnley’s faithful sister, Kris Marshall as her layabout boyfriend and Ralf Little as the ex are all given too little to work with to make them more than just cyphers, something Indhu Rubasingham’s production can’t rectify for all its charismatic casting. But in Fleetwood, it has the kind of hypnotically magnificent performance that almost makes you forgive any or all shortcomings."
698,698,Ought To Be Clowns,28/12/2013,Ian,That Day We Sang, Royal Exchange,"Victoria Wood’s That Day We Sang premiered at the Manchester International Festival in 2011 and it fair near captured my heart with its archetypal northern charm and its determination to find the special in the mundane. I wrote about the show back then but Sarah Frankcom’s production for the Royal Exchange features a reworked and recast version of this play with songs which has proven to be a canny choice indeed for the Manchester venue’s festive offering. The show tells the story of how a group of Mancunian schoolchildren ended up performing with the Hallé Orchestra in 1929 on a Purcell recording and also the results of a get-together 40 years later for a Granada TV documentary. The two strands interweave and overlap as two of the choir engage in a putative romance after the reunion, the aspirations of their younger selves contrasted with the drabness of the older and the potential spark ignited after the long-awaited meeting. Teams of talented kids rotate the roles of the singing children under Ian Townsend’s sterling musical direction and Anna Francolini’s bottled-up PA Enid and Dean Andrews’ happy-go-lucky schmuck of an insurance clerk Tubby make an utterly adorable couple for whom it is impossible not to root for, and they drive the show through its lumpier moments when the narrative doesn’t quite slide as easily as it could between the two timeframes. "
699,699,Ought To Be Clowns,12/12/2015,mag9l,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, West Yorkshire Playhouse,"Who knew that Leeds would be a musical theatre hotspot this December but between The Girls and this Music & Lyrics and West Yorkshire Playhouse production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, it’s been the place to be for big, warm-hearted musical fun. This is the first new version of Chitty Chitty… since its original 2002 West End production and its many regional tours but in James Brining’s clever and wondrous adaptation, it’s thoroughly revitalised and as lovely as any cherry peach parfait. Ian Fleming’s novel was adapted by Jeremy Sams, via Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes’ own reshaping of the story for the cinema, and with a glorious score from the Sherman Brothers (as if they could do any other kind) beefed up with new songs by them as well, it captures much of the Disney noir feel of the film whilst bringing its own depths too. I’d forgotten how much sadness there was in the tale and that’s something Brining never lets us forget, even whilst delighting us with flying cars and fun. Jon Robyns is ideally cast as Caractacus Potts, a marvellous mixture of melancholy and magic, and with Amy Griffiths as an excellent, empowered Truly Scrumptious, there’s a beautiful delicacy to their work, epitomised by her ‘Lovely Lonely Man’ that I adored. At this performance, Harry Kent and Caitlin Surtees as his children Jeremy and Jemima were both vibrantly assured performers and given there’s a year-long tour ahead (for some of them at least), signs look positive for surviving the choppy waters of regional touring. With such songs and such a company (Sam Harrison and Scott Paige’s henchmen are excellent too), there’s much to love but Brining’s real coup emerges in the staging though. Simon Higlett’s design and Simon Wainwright’s projection work is just inspired, allowing for hugely theatrical rollercoaster moments of flight and genuinely disturbing imagery surrounding Stephen Matthews’ brilliantly eerie Childcatcher – the whole thing meshes together more effectively. I wanted to see it again as soon as I left and with dates stretching through to January 2017, I might just do that! "

701,701,Ought To Be Clowns,09/04/2018,Ian,Spring Awakening, Hope Mill,"In many ways, the teenage energy of Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater’s Spring Awakening is a great match for the youthful verve of Manchester’s Hope Mill Theatre. The creative upstarts of this fringe powerhouse are maintaining its burgeoning reputation extremely well and with this raucous take on Frank Wedekind’s 1891 play, look set to continue. Luke Sheppard’s production hangs on its superb casting, drawing talent fresh from drama school (Darragh Cowley and Teleri Hughes) as well as a couple of more experienced hands (Ragtime’s Seyi Omooba) And the company fill the stage with a rough-edged vitality that marks out lots of potential for musicals to come. "
702,702,Ought To Be Clowns,13/08/2011,Ian,Anna Christie, Donmar Warehouse,"Generally speaking I try to avoid reading anything about a show, especially reviews, before I’ve seen it and written about it as despite the best of intentions, one always ends up parroting certain views as one’s own and this blog is meant to be about my opinion on shows. But the internet and Twitter in particular makes that increasingly difficult these days and earlier this week I’d been notified of Billington’s 5 star review for the Guardian and the tantalising promise of a ‘glistening torso’ which meant my already-keen anticipation for the Donmar Warehouse’s Anna Christie increased just that little bit more! As part of his farewell season, Michael Grandage is pulling out the big guns and this features the return of two big name alumni for the Donmar – Jude Law has been getting much of the attention, he was an excellent Hamlet in the Donmar’s West End season, but also Ruth Wilson, slightly less heralded though criminally so, as she is one of the brightest acting talents we have in this country, her Stella in A Streetcar Named Desire earning her an Olivier. But to the play: Anna Christie is a 1921 Pulitzer Prize-winning work by Eugene O’Neill about the return of a young Swedish woman – Anna – to her father’s side after he sent her away at the age of 5 to distant family relations. He’s working on a coal barge and so she joins him in the hope of finding a better life as the idealised family life he thought he’d given her couldn’t be farther from the truth. When they rescue a crew from a shipwreck, including the charismatic Mat, there’s a tussle between the two men for her affection though Anna’s future finally seems to be looking up, but the secrets from her past will not stay buried and threaten everything. Last seen here breaking my heart with readings of WWI poetry, Ruth Wilson is simply exceptional as Anna: combining the spiky independence of a woman forced to grow up too quickly with the touching realisation and subsequent willingness to subtly change, to allow the potential for happiness in her life whilst not wholly surrendering her destiny to anyone else. As the wiry seadog Chris, David Hayman gives an intensely fierce reading of a man confronted with the reality of fatherhood rather too late and struggling to deal with the woman that the 5 year old in his mind’s eye has become. And completing the triumvirate of stellar acting performances is Jude Law who is expectation-confoundingly excellent: he subsumes himself so totally into the role of Mat that he is barely recognisable as the Hollywood actor he became. The transformation is partly physical, a full beard and an outrageously muscular physique (which does indeed glisten), but it is so much more than that too. There’s a masculinity, an explosive virility that seeps from him, shot through with a quirkiness of Irish charm, he’s as likely to throw a chair against the wall as he is to dance a little jig of delight and it is just captivating to watch. Ashford and his creative team feel like a breath of fresh air in the Donmar, using the stage in an extremely inventive way – though one might posit that Paul Wills’ caught the Young Vic’s recent I Am The Wind… – to evoke life on the water, the storm in particular is very well mounted. But in what is effectively a three-hander, Ashford also shows an intelligent use of space to show the way the protagonists relate to each other. Though an intimate theatre, the emotional distance feels vast at times, adding a beautiful frisson to the moments when they do finally come together. The supporting cast add atmosphere with their small cameos and sea-shanty singing and the overall effect is stunning. My only little thing was with the accents. O’Neill specifies particular accents for his lead characters and I have to admit to finding them quite challenging. One does gets accustomed but they are just so ‘present’ in the performances, almost a distraction, that it took me until the end of the third act to really forget that Wilson and Law were using them no matter how naturally they were delivered; Hayman’s bizarrely unique (and barely intelligible) sound though never managed to transcend – every time he spoke I first thought to myself, what an odd noise he is making, before paying attention to try and decipher what he was saying."
703,703,Ought To Be Clowns,26/05/2010,Ian,Bull, Finborough,"Mike Bartlett’s new play receives its world premiere here at the Finborough as part of Vibrant, their 30th Anniversary festival celebrating new plays from playwrights with connections to the Finborough theatre. In a move surely designed to provide the West End Whingers with a few more months of jokes, the play is called Bull, making it an ideal companion piece to his last, immensely successful, and Olivier award winning play Cock, I can see the double bill already…A Cock and Bull Story anyone?! The 30 premieres are all staged readings but offer an intriguing look at what some of the most exciting fresh playwrights are currently working on. Faced with recession and cutbacks, the company has decided to lose someone from Thomas’s team. He is determined it won’t be him, but his two colleagues have other ideas. Daniel Ryan, fresh from his run in Posh as a put-upon publican, is Thomas, a put-upon businessman here, unfortunately not the intellectual equal of his peers and consequently the perfect victim for their goading and bullying, the bull to their matadors assumably. Ryan plays the dunderhead extremely well, his indignant anger doing little to help his cause and the way in which he is cut down quite heartbreakingly difficult to watch. Adam Jones and Sian Brooke are simply terrifying as Tony and Isobel, Thomas’ super-confident and viciously manipulative colleagues, toying with him, baiting him and ultimately humiliating him even in the knowledge of their already-secured victory, such is their enjoyment of simply ‘playing the game’. They both delivered bitingly cruel performances, wrapping their tongues around the acerbic text and spitting out their lines with a coldly calculating air. Robin Soans has the minor part of Mr Carter, the boss making the decisions about the redundancies, pulling off a nicely patronising tone of a target-obsessed corporate type."

705,705,Ought To Be Clowns,03/02/2016,mag9l,The Meeting, Hampstead Downstairs,"Opening up 2016 downstairs at Hampstead, Andrew Payne’s The Meeting starts off brightly as a sharp office-set comedy where a crucial deal looks set to be torpedoed when one of the key parties has to be escorted from the premises after suffering an emotional breakdown. Denis Lawson’s production has fun with corporate behaviour and its nameless threats (“there’s been murmurs on the 10th floor”) but is perhaps a little less sure-footed when it then tackles sexism in the boardroom. Cleverly, for all the talk of concepts and options, entry level kits and secondary licensing, we never find out exactly what it is the beleaguered Stratton and youthfully belligerent Cole do. For The Meeting is more about the way they behave – with each other, with Frank from upstairs, with the various unseen women in their lives, and with Ellen, who is stepping in for the indisposed Jack and disrupting the old boys’ network on which they had been relying for an easy time of it. Payne is good when it comes to showing the power games played in offices and the sexism, both casual and overt, that can permeate such environments, where post-work drinks take place in the nearby gentleman’s establishment rather than the pub. Mark Hadfield’s Stratton, all avuncular bluster, constantly refers to Ellen as Helen; Sam Swainsbury’s cocky Cole, would-be rebellious in hi-tops and t-shirt, treats her with disdain from the start; and Malcolm Sinclair’s wonderfully jocular Frank prowls the space like a big cat, with quiet (and not-so-quiet) authority.  But as the deadline for signing the favourable contract approaches and it becomes increasingly apparent that Rebecca Night’s calmly measured Ellen is no pushover when it comes to checking her colleague’s work, the men start to panic about whether they can get away with it. And so starts a series of manipulations as clause rewrites and amendments are bandied about, meetings interrupted by mysterious happenings on the fourth floor, the upper hand sought by all."
706,706,Ought To Be Clowns,26/02/2017,mag9l,Austentatious, Leicester Square,"Time for the monthly visit to Austentatious and this trip saw Jane Austen’s undiscovered novel Tears and Torsos get its first airing, including all manner of slippery clay, parents inside a tiger, nudity, promiscuity and a diablo maniac in Brighton. As ever, it remains a brilliant way to spend a Sunday night, over and done with in an hour which means you can go home (like my friends did) or carry on drinking (like I accidentally did). Either way, you really should get yourselves along to one of their shows sooner or later. London dates here and UK dates here."
707,707,Ought To Be Clowns,23/04/2018,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Theatro Technis,"With an ensemble comprising of 12 nationalities, the Acting Gymanium are currently performing three plays in rep at Mornington Crescent’s Theatro Technis. And it was a contemporary music festival-inspired take on A Midsummer Night’s Dream,  adapted and directed by Gavin McAlinden, that tempted me the most The festival setting is an inspired idea as far as the quartet of lovers is concerned. The heady rush of drug fuelled shenanigans is a good fit for these four and the actors respond well to the treatment, particularly John Celea’s Demetrius and Dorian Hasani’s Lysander whose lovelorn antics for Helena verge on the hysterical. It’s a trickier task to fit the royals into this world, thus this Theseus and Hippolyta don’t make too much of an impact as you can’t quite see where they fit. And if there’s something a little staid and traditional about the way the fairies float and flutter, the physicality of Max Easton’s playful Puck and the pulsing sexuality of Lisa Kinshuck and Michael Claff’s Titania and (beautifully spoken) Oberon are fun to watch. And there’s lots of good ideas here – Bottom in a gimp mask, the notion that Titania is by far the most powerful of the fairies, the way in which Puck delivers his doses of love-in-idleness, the way in how easy it is to get lost and disorientated in the heaving crowd at a festival is used. There are moments where the larger concept could be pulled through more effectively, wordless sequences that go on a little too long, and the occasional rushed delivery. But all in all, a diverting Dream."
708,708,Ought To Be Clowns,13/01/2013,Ian,Somersaults, Finborough,"The Outer Hebrides have an austere challenging beauty about them and so too does Iain Finlay Macleod’s play Somersaults, relishing in an inscrutable quality which equally entertains and frustrates. After premiering in Edinburgh last year, director Russell Bolam has brought it to the intimate surroundings of the Finborough where its mix of English and Gaelic makes a fascinating exploration into where language and cultural heritage intersect in our lives. Born on the Isle of Lewis (as was Macleod), David Carlyle’s James has since gotten it all. A lucrative dotcom business, a swanky pad in Hampstead, he even managed to marry the prettiest girl at university, but this has all come at a price – he’s become disconnected from his birthplace and increasingly so, from the language he spoke as a child, Scots Gaelic. And when his carefully constructed new life crashes down around him, it seems the ideal time to re-establish those links with home and the heart. But those connections are growing ever fainter. As the Gaelic slips from his memory, so too is it sliding into inexorable decline as a world language, a fact underscored by the terminal illness of James’ father Sandy, Tom Marshall’s tenderly blythe patriarch. And in a world where all his possessions have been reclaimed by Richard Teverson’s unknowable liquidator, the one thing he thought he still had – the voice of his boyhood – appears to be as ephemeral as his more material possessions. It’s an engaging premise and one that is fitfully fulfilled. James and Sandy’s scenes are largely played solely in Gaelic to powerful effect, showing the bond it forms between them, and Teverson plays up the creepiness of the man dismantling James’ life, even so far as to making inroads on his precious language in a genuinely chilling moment – the fear and impact of losing a minority language suddenly anatomised beautifully. But the non-linear narrative isn’t quite brave enough, falling too easily into greater convention as the play progresses and so losing the enigmatic thrill with which Macleod’s writing began and exposing the thinness of some of the supporting characterisation. Bolam’s direction also reflects a similarly muddled tone, occasionally inspired but sometimes overly fussy and not quite aware of the limitations of this stage. "
709,709,Ought To Be Clowns,23/05/2016,mag9l,An Evening with Matthew Strachan & Guests, St James Studio,"There’s an event at the St James Studio in a couple of weeks called Sunday at the Musicals which has over 20 female singers coming together to celebrate the world of musical theatre, showing off what can be achieved in the freedom of the one-night cabaret form. Which just goes to point up the relative disappointment of a night called An Evening with Matthew Strachan & Guests which just managed the two, with one song a piece. Strachan is a composer of considerable credits (as per Wikipedia) but has the ignominy, or perhaps renown, of being best known for writing the theme tune to TV show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. And as we discover throughout the couple of hours of his show, there’s much more to his back catalogue, with time spent in Nashville writing for others providing an anecdote or two to accompany the material. His writing style is very much focused on character-driven songs, often comedic, centring on the quirkier side of life but in all honesty, the evening only really came to life when his guest stars were performing – a moving Wendi Peters and a powerful Abigail Matthews both nailing their song. And I’d go so far as to wager that Strachan feels happier as an accompanist than performer, which is a bit of a problem when your show is heavily balanced the other way."
710,710,Ought To Be Clowns,11/02/2019,Ian,The Half Moon Shania, VAULT Festival,"It’s 1999 and punk band The G-Stringz aren’t just out to party, rumour has it there’s a rep from Diamond Records in the audience and maybe, just maybe this is their big break. Burnt Lemon Theatre’s The Half Moon Shania, written by Cara Baldwin, weaves together past and present as tales of the band’s formation mix in with what impact it has had on their lives so far, all soundtracked by a raucous gig. An ambitious work, it taps into the festival spirit well – the show did well in Edinburgh last year – as the band constantly spills off the stage to smash the fourth wall, even trying to encourage a mosh pit at one point. And Hannah Benson’s astute direction teases out just the right energy from Baldwin and her castmates Freya Parks and Catherine Davies."
711,711,Ought To Be Clowns,04/08/2011,Ian,As You Like It, Shakespeare’s Globe,"Are certain of Shakespeare’s plays done to death whilst other neglected? When asking a friend, with whom I caught up briefly this week, what he was going to see this week, my response to him saying As You Like It was ‘which one?’. This may actually be the only production currently running in London – though I did take in the Royal Exchange’s modernised version on my trip to Manchester last month – but it does feel we are never too far away from As You Like It in one shape or another. This particular production, which has played a few dates at Shakespeare’s Globe in the midst of a considerable UK and Europe jaunt, has the similar small-scale touring feel to the Hamlet that opened the Globe’s season this year with a small cast of travelling players – here in Victorian dress – covering all the roles and providing the musical accompaniment, all from the large wooden box that dominates, and forms an integral part of, the stage. Emma Pallant won my vote for outstanding player of the night: her Madame Jacques makes great use of the gender switch to provide acres of unspoken context for her deep aching sadness and as Phebe, she finds a great spikiness – her looks to the audience could stop armies – as she is wrangled into accepting the love of Silvius. Gunnar Cauthery makes an appealing Orlando, drawn to the schoolgirlish effervescence of Jo Herbert’s Rosalind and close chum Celia, played with a nice generosity by Beth Park. Herbert is generally very strong as Rosalind and her alter ego Ganymede, balancing her protective sharpness with an endearing playfulness and a true sense of heart. The only problem for me was I found it hard to cast Cush Jumbo’s extraordinary performance at the Royal Exchange out of my mind: to be sure, it’s completely different and so impossible to compare but it was the type of interpretation and performance that lives in the mind. Overall, I did enjoy myself, but couldn’t help but feel that it was perhaps a little too light-hearted and whimsical, the darkness that is a part of the story undercut a little too much – the strength of Pallant’s performance is almost too much for the production in some respects. I was quite tickled by John O’Mahoney bearded Audrey yet as it often the case with Fools, I didn’t care much at all for Gregory Gudgeon’s Touchstone – bawdy mime may get big laughs and so is prevalent in Globe productions but it is increasingly becoming one of my bugbears. James Dacre’s production weaves in music in a great way throughout, the players demonstrating a nice range of instrument skills, the energy on display is admirable and as someone encouraging me to go beforehand pointed out, the Comedies are much better suited to this style of playing – I really didn’t feel that it worked for Hamlet. This is a production which provides solid entertainment rather than the freshness of interpretation my AYLI-weary soul craved and was teased with, but ultimately it felt very much in tune with the venue and the audience expectation. I still can’t help but feel we might all benefit from giving productions of this play a rest for a wee while.  The only bad thing about the experience was the group of Spanish people who basically ruined much of the first half with their constant chatter, shuffling and moving of suitcases, they hushed a little after a stern word from me (Mother would be proud!) but the behaviour was frankly appalling. Maybe it is the price you pay for cheapness of Yard tickets but not for the first time this year, my enjoyment of play-watching at the Globe has been seriously hampered with ushers unable or unwilling to intervene when requested. Yes, I think some are overdone and some neglected! I'd personally like to see a well-done production of Titus Andronicus, Shakespeare's ""worst"" play, as I actually think it's pretty good … :/ I love classical theatre, which may be why!And this is one reason I am (sadly) reluctant to see big West-end musicals or other shows anymore… because of the tourists who incessantly talk the entire way through, mostly to translate to their bratty children what's happening. Honesdtly it makes me so bloody angry how RUDE these people are!! As if they weren't prepared beforehand for the fact that the play'd be in a language they DIDN'T UNDERSTAND…! You may have seen my post on WOS about bad behaviour at the Globe. Ruined Much Ado for me, and now I don't feel like going back there in the future! 🙁 You should go back at some point, Pharaoh. Maybe try to avoid ""peak"" times, i.e. school summer holidays, if that's convenient. You do get bad behaviour from time to time, and I suspect there will always be a little more chattering at this kind of venue so don't expect it to be like a traditional theatre, but honestly I've had far more good experiences than bad there, audience-wise. (And production-wise!) ^ That was me btw. Also: suitcases?! That's a new one. I definitely agree with your point about this play being overdone, though as it happens I've ended up missing most of the productions lately. Last one for me (apart from this) was the RSC one last summer. I preferred this one, though Katy Stephens was a great Rosalind for the RSC. I'll go back next year, if Rylance returns! Incidently, on a different topic, do we know who is replacing Eve Best in Much Ado? I think it is impossible to avoid a bad audience, in the first half at least as you can always move post-interval, my three bad'uns have taken place at different times, it is just the luck of the draw (or not as the case may be). But I wouldn't let it put you off completely, there's much pleasure to be gained from being a groundling too. I still have that RSC AYLI to watch on the digital player thing, I bought it when it was cheap! Amd I don't believe Best's replacement has been announced yet. I hope it is someone I can resist!!"
712,712,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2018,Ian,Summer and Smoke, Almeida,"When ‘director’s theatre’ looks and feels like this, it’s hard to believe that anyone would take against it. Director Rebecca Frecknall, aided by designer Tom Scutt, throws out the rulebook when it comes to Tennessee Williams, and comes up with something beautiful, something that genuinely feels like Williams for a contemporary age. It helps that Summer and Smoke is relatively unheralded among his vast canon. And that the Almeida under Rupert Goold is as close as you’ll come to a director’s theatre. But the key is Frecknall’s vision of a world unmoored from the turn-of-the-century Mississippi setting and relocated to somewhere altogether more elemental.   The staging, with all its pianos, is ingenious. Striking both to look at and to listen to, as the cast use them to create a wide-ranging soundscape (composed by Angus MacRae) that tracks the tempestuous emotional relationship between Patsy Ferran’s Alma and Matthew Needham’s John. Here, Ferran lives up to the billing of the Second Coming that the critical community seems determined to foist on her. Her way of moving, acting, even thinking, sets her out as matchless among her peers, a thoroughly untypical Williams heroine and all the stronger for it."
713,713,Ought To Be Clowns,15/06/2011,Ian,Seagull, Arcola,"The Arcola has had something of an unofficial Russian season of late, what with Anna Karenina and Uncle Vanya, and so their attention now turns to Chekhov’s classic play Seagull (the definitive article is clearly passé this year what with Government Inspector losing it too) with Runaway Theatre, using a new translation by Charlotte Pyke, John Kerr and Joseph Blatchley, the latter of whom is also the director. Set in 19th century Russia, the story revolves around four artistic types: fading actress Arkadina, young ingénue Nina, successful writer Trigorin and would-be playwright Konstantin and their complicated loves and lives between each other and those around them. When Konstantin puts on a play for the two women in his life, it acts as the precipice for a tragic set of consequences as all strive for emotional happiness and artistic freedom, yet despair and failure are never far away. With this new translation that adhered word-for-word to the original text, it was discovered that some cuts and amendments had been made by the Russian censor back in 1896 and these have now been restored. It doesn’t quite mean there’s now Tarantino-levels of swearing and violence, indeed I would reckon even Chekhovian scholars would be hard-pressed to notice all the changes as many of them are relatively minor, but adding layers of subtlety to characters and a touch of clarity to relationships that contribute to the overall feeling of freshness to this interpretation. For that is the major achievement of this production, it has really reinvigorated Chekhov’s classic and lent it the excitingly powerful, persuasive air of seeing something clearly for the first time. That it manages this without resorting to the crude modern language that Andrew Upton adopted for the National Theatre’s The Cherry Orchard is all the more impressive as Seagull’s energy and directness in its dealings with love and ambition and how so much of our efforts end up in disappointment and frustration, demonstrates just how timeless the original is. It really is an ensemble show, though the role of Arkadina is one which attracts the highest calibre of actress, and here we have Geraldine James working genuine magic as the self-absorbed resting actress, unaware of the impact she has on those around her and how that ripples out, particularly in her rubbishing her son’s work in order to make herself feel better. Her relationship with Al Weaver’s pale, goateed Konstantin is gorgeously played, his neediness for her attention, her desperation for his forgiveness, the scene as she redresses his head wound but end up fighting is just spell-binding. She also connects superbly with Matt Wilkinson’s handsome Trigorin, who looks just the part, in her manipulations to keep her younger lover by her side. But it truly is about the ensemble and the multiple tangled love connections. Jodie McNee’s snuff-taking matter-of-fact Masha is a brilliant beacon of fierce intelligence, brushing aside Medvedenko’s puppyish affections and sensing an intellectual connection with Trigorin, whose shared humour is so touching, but suffering a broken heart from her unrequited love for Konstantin. He in turn holds the brightest candle for Nina, a startlingly assured performance here from Yolanda Kettle, but she only has eyes for Trigorin, Wilkinson lighting up from inside at what she inspires in him. These inter-relationships are observed and commented upon with a crinkly wry humour by the old guard, represented excellently by Roger Lloyd Pack as Dorn and Will Knightley as Sorin, Gabrielle Lloyd also adding to voice of weary experience as Masha’s mother. The lightness of touch with which they play the first three acts, even with the drama contained within, is executed so well and with such warm humour threaded throughout, that the sledgehammer of the final act, set two years later and with tragedy so firmly in the air, becomes truly disturbing. The physical transformation that McNee and Kettle make is just upsetting and the inevitability of the crushing of the dreams of all and sundry, who we’ve come to really like, makes this as devastatingly affecting as one could imagine. Dora Schweitzer’s simple set, with its grass-laid floor and scattered rugs allows Bletchley’s direction to focus on gradually increasing the emotional intensity to create a genuinely refreshing Chekhov experience. I agree, this is far superior to the turgid nonsense on at the National."
714,714,Ought To Be Clowns,20/05/2016,mag9l,This Is Living, Trafalgar Studios,"One of the rarest things to find in the theatre, for me at least, is people I actually want to spend time with. On stage, of course. But Alice and Michael, the couple at the heart of Liam Borrett’s debut play This is Living, are just that – adorable, engaging, quirky, funny, utterly and thoroughly human. There were times where I could have listened to them talk for hours, whether the awkward bumbling of their first encounter or their flirtatious banter or the precious moments of genuine soulmate connection, I can’t remember the last time I just wanted to kick back and listen like this. Which is exactly what Borrett wants, as he pulls the rug out from underneath the relationship by killing Alice off. Spoilers I hear you cry but don’t worry, that’s how the play opens, with Michael having to tell his partner that she died 12 hours ago. From there, we get a beautifully restrained and moving exploration of love and loss as we flick between present and past and back again, sometimes in the space of a howled emotion or a single sentence, the unimaginable pain of losing a loved one both exacerbated and made more tolerable by clinging onto the memories of a life lived. A reworked and recast version of the 2014 Edinburgh Festival hit, This is Living thus manages to both break your heart and fill it with joy simultaneously. As Michael repeatedly returns to the spot where his wife died, together they try to find a way to move on, to say goodbye, to get through a grief made worse by the fact that they’re parents to a 3 year old girl too. In the splash pool of Sarah Beaton’s design, the grim reality of Alice’s fate is ever-present but it also provides the kind of transcendental blankness needed for Jackie Shemesh’s transformative lighting to move us through timestreams."
715,715,Ought To Be Clowns,31/10/2017,Ian,The Slaves of Solitude, Hampstead," The Hampstead’s failure to engage properly with issues of female creative representation on its main stage (out of seven shows for 2017, only one was written by a woman and none were directed by women) has meant it has dropped off my must-see list of theatres. But on reading the synopsis of Patrick Hamilton’s The Slaves of Solitude – adapted by Nicholas Wright, directed by Jonathan Kent, designed, lit and sounded out by men too natch – with its lead female protagonist, I was persuaded to revisit my stance. And in some ways, I’m glad I did. For that leading character, Miss Roach, is played by the ever-marvellous Fenella Woolgar and she’s partnered by Lucy Cohu, another favourite actress, and there are moments in this gently played Second World War-set story that shimmer with effectiveness. Bombed out of her home by the Blitz, Miss Roach (“I do have a first name, but I don’t encourage people to use it”) finds herself swept up in a different type of conflict at the Henley-on-Thames boarding house where she now resides. Forced to live with a set of characters considerably older than herself, an affair with a black US soldier and her friendship with a German émigré who then moves in simultaneously provides a diverting sense of excitement and a serious threat to the even keel of her archetypal English reserve. This is perfectly exemplified in a gorgeously staged scene where Roach finds herself on the fringes of the drunken carousings of an impromptu late-night house party, her conflicted balefulness communicated devastatingly by a wordless Woolgar, lit solely by the feeble glow of a table lamp. "
716,716,Ought To Be Clowns,27/03/2016,mag9l,Hamlet, Royal Shakespeare Theatre,"It is an interpretation full of bold choices – opening at Hamlet’s Wittenberg graduation ceremony whose celebratory mood is shattered by his father’s funeral cortège scything through the stage – and largely successful, underpinned by Essiedu’s assuredly capricious performance of impulsive exuberance. This Hamlet is a lover not a fighter, an artist rather than a soldier, youthfully funny but full of a student’s swagger rather than lived-in experience. What works really well is the sense of dislocation here, the realities of court life are miles away from Hamlet’s Western university experience and that cultural shift is crucial in the identity crisis that Essiedu shows us so fluently, his hands constantly reaching out into the air as if to reshape his world into something more recognisable. It’s no accident that when the ghost of his father (Ewart James Walters) appears, it is in tribal robes, and it’s a train of thought that finds eloquent echoes in Lorraine Hansberry’s Les Blancs, soon to open at the National.  Beyond that, the production could benefit from some dramaturgical clarity though. It’s never abundantly clear just what “the state of Denmark” is here – the military uniform of Clarence Smith’s Claudius suggests a police state but Cyril Nri’s excellently garrulous Polonius seems way too chipper for that. And you feel more could be made of the post-colonial setting to really investigate its legacy here – as it is, the shift from guns to fighting sticks (instead of foils) feels rather abrupt, even if the drumbeats of Sola Akingbola’s insistent live music taps into something elemental about Africa and its extraordinary history. There’s plenty of fascinating character work to compensate though. Tanya Moodie’s imperious Gertrude is a fearsome presence, her regal strutting is quite something to behold, but she unravels movingly as ghosts begin to haunt her too; the raw pain of Natalie Simpson’s superb Ophelia sees her literally tear the hair from her head to give out as the herbs, that anguish finding a stunning mirror in Hiran Abeysekera’s Horatio whose final moments linger long in the mind."
717,717,Ought To Be Clowns,13/04/2014,mag9l,Incognito, HighTide,"If you saw the mega-hit that was Nick Payne’s Constellations, then the fragmented structure of his new play Incognito will come as little surprise. Here, he has deconstructed three stories loosely connected around the theme of neurology and woven them back together in a searching meditation on the vital importance memory plays in our lives and also in the construction of our very selves and touching on how little we truly understand about it. Payne riffs off historical events for two of the three strands – the bizarre theft of Albert Einstein’s brain by the man who performed the autopsy on him, and the pioneering experiences of Henry Maison who underwent experimental brain surgery and thus helped shape the future of neuroscience. Along with extended and embellished versions of both stories is the tale of Martha, a present-day clinical neuropsychologist also caught in a moment of mental fragility. Joe Murphy’s production has a wonderfully synaptic rhythm, moving swiftly from scene to scene with a carefully modulated speed as character after character is introduced and shards of stories dangled in front of us, the play’s structure developing as it progresses too. Payne has largely resisted a logical progression of his narrative so our own thought processes come into play, clues and information eventually coalescing into clarity but the moments of realisation visibly coming at different points, an interesting brain exercise in itself.  He’s helped by a marvellous quartet of performances – Alison O’Donnell, Paul Hickey, Amelia Lowdell and Sargon Yelda free-wheeling their way through over 20 characters and managing to delineate them all beautifully. There’s a neat balance too between the crushingly heart-breaking world of brain injuries and the comic relief often necessary whilst working in such a difficult field – Yelda’s traumatised Henry countered by his hilariously inappropriate lawyer, O’Donnell’s overwhelmed wife contrasted with her brash Aussie waitress. "
718,718,Ought To Be Clowns,14/06/2012,Ian,Twelfth Night, RSC at the Roundhouse,"Throughout the lengthy first half, the production works hard but doesn’t quite click fully into gear. Taaffe’s Viola, who oddly looks a dead ringer for La Roux when in disguise, doesn’t quite convey enough on-stage charisma for someone so central to the plot: in the case of her scenes with Orsino, it is hardly her fault as Jonathan McGuinness’ disappointingly flat Duke lacked any perceptible sense of passion or sexuality; but against Kirsty Bushell’s exuberant Olivia, there’s just something that doesn’t quite work and so the tone set for this reviewer was of polite engagement rather than genuine thrill. Post-interval though, the chaotic liveliness works its charm and speeds the show to its dénouement with a spring in its step.   Performances are predictably strong for the most part, and in some cases superlative. Jonathan Slinger’s sneering Malvolio is truly excellent in the letter-reading scene and simply breath-taking once gussied up in a manner which could be seen as somewhat excessive for the purpose but effective nonetheless with a truly compelling psychological portrait. Bushell’s Olivia has an edge of cabin fever, going just a little crazy from her self-imposed exile in the hotel, but one which translates into a nicely strident sexuality and some great innovative line readings. Bruce MacKinnon’s Aguecheek possesses a great bumbling warmth; Kevin McMonagle’s melancholy troubadouring as Feste (Adem Ilhan’s music is excellent) sets the mood well; and Cecilia Noble’s Maria neatly suggests that the revenge plot she leads is borne out of her experience of racism.  On the surface, this Twelfth Night appears to be one which is painted in broad strokes and much of the comic business plays towards that interpretation. But on further examination, it is actually a production that is full of innovative thought, careful detailing and interesting new ideas. As with most reimaginings, not everything necessarily works as smoothly as it possibly could, but this is an intriguing account of the play. Having seen The Comedy of Errors the previous night, it is also genuine pleasure, and one which I highly recommend, to watch the company working across the different plays."
719,719,Ought To Be Clowns,11/06/2019,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Bridge Theatre,"You can tell a lot about a production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream from the way it treats its Hippolyta. Possessed of so few words, her presence is nevertheless vital for setting the tone of the play and from the moment you walk into the Bridge Theatre, you just know Nicholas Hytner has got it right. This conquered queen is caged in a glass box, as if an artefact in some grotesque museum and as an impassive Gwendoline Christie fixes us with her  stare, it’s a definitive commentary on the gender politics here before we’ve even started. But even once the play starts, her power is no less unremarkable. As Hermia claims she knows not by what power she is made bold, one look at Hippolyta’s hand against the glass leaves you in  no doubt of the source of her new found confidence. Small but powerful changes that set the scene perfectly for Hytner’s most striking innovation which, as it reveals itself in the following act, proved to be one of the most thrilling ways to re-infuse excitement into this oft-performed classic. 
For Titania and Oberon have swapped roles, he’s the one who ends up at the mercy of his partner’s magical mischievousness, and the shift in power dynamic is a really interesting one to observe. Christie revels in the increased line-count (her “I know a bank where the wild thyme blows…” is exquisite) and brings a real playfulness to her fairy monarch and as her counterpart, Oliver Chris is game indeed as he dotes on Hammed Animashaun’s Bottom, a relationship played more comically than sensually here (which ultimately feels right for this production although it also has the troubling side-effect of encouraging laughter at two men kissing…).  
This is a very funny Dream, and a joyful one too. The comic chemistry between the Rude Mechanicals is apparent from the off and utterly delightful to behold from chaotic rehearsal to X-Factor-ish waiting games to a frankly hilarious rendition of the Prologue. And if the pyjama-clad quartet of lovers, cast rather young here, pale just a little bit by comparison in their scenes, they come into their own once they enter ‘dream-land’ with Hytner once again queering the pitch unexpectedly and successfully.  The show utilises the same promenade approach introduced with Julius Caesar last year, which allows for an element of immersiveness for those standing in the pit. What really works though is the height of the production. These fairies have been to circus school (literally so in the case of David Moorst, a camp Northern comedian of a Puck) and Bunny Christie’s design, with Arlene Phillips’ movement direction and Christina Cunningham’s costumes, has a gorgeous visual impact as it soars. 
As the first of three major Dreams opening in London this summer (though that’s nothing, I saw six in 2016), this sets the (trapeze) bar very high indeed. More than anything, this feels like a truly contemporary Dream without ever forcing it, highlighting its underlying thoughts about gender just enough, as in the moment when Jermaine Freeman’s Flute draws together his “sisters three” from the noble ladies of the court. Beautifully done.    "
720,720,Ought To Be Clowns,17/10/2018,Ian,Company, Gielgud,"Phone rings, door chimes, in comes an adaptation of Company that subtly but definitively realigns it for a contemporary audience and makes you wonder how you could ever go back to the original as is. Marianne Elliott’s reworking is most notable for the regendering of its lead character – Bobby becomes Bobbie in the extraordinary hands of Rosalie Craig – but the changes it makes filter right down through the show, reflecting the changes in society since the show was written in 1970. Sometimes it is overt. Amy becomes Jamie here, and Jonathan Bailey’s show-stopping delivery of ‘Getting Married Today’ (seriously, best priest in a show, ever) is underscored by the fact that gay marriage is a thing now. Less obvious is the switching of roles for Susan and Peter, she’s the professional go-getter and he’s the one who faints at the sight of blood. And even Larry becoming something of a toyboy for Joanne speaks towards an important rebuttal of the kinds of cultural stereotype that have been allowed to persist.   And ultimately, that is the point. All these people (and more) are the friends and acquaintances of Bobbie and are trying to throw her a surprise birthday party who, at the age of 35, can’t decide whether she’s footloose and fancy-free or unmarried and childless or whether the two are even mutually exclusive. As she bounces from encounter to encounter with the married couples in her life, George Furth’s book and Stephen Sondheim’s music and lyrics somehow find an entirely new lease of life. Craig revels in the full attention of this sumptuous production, slipping between the sliding boxes of Bunny Christie’s imaginative and inventive design. She’s a fully rounded, complex and all-too-recognisable character, moving through the looking glass like Alice but also making sure that a bedroom session with a ripped flight attendant focuses on her sexual needs. She tears through the score too, the anger that begins ‘Being Alive’ is a terrifically raw surprise.  And then there’s Patti LuPone. A polarising figure to be sure, but her presence here as Joanne elevates the show into one for the ages. The disdain that drips from her ‘mmm-hmmms’, the scorching take on ‘Ladies Who Lunch’, her gameness in pushing furniture around for ‘Side By Side…’, it feels a genuine privilege to see her and she is just magnificent from start to finish. The nature of the show in its series of vignettes means that the rest of the cast get relatively short shrift, or on the other hand it means that they all take every single moment they have to shine. Alex Gaumond and Jennifer Saayeng are sorely under-used but Bailey is stunning, Mel Giedroyc is a comic delight with partner Gavin Spokes, and Matthew Seadon-Young, George Blagden and Richard Fleeshman drive everyone crazy with a wonderfully re-orchestrated close-harmony group take on that song. "
721,721,Ought To Be Clowns,17/03/2016,mag9l,A Raisin in the Sun, Albany,"When Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun became the first play written by a black woman to be performed on Broadway in 1959, some might have dared dream of a new age of diverse playwrights being represented there. But despite the play’s extraordinary success, the Great White Way remains an unfortunately apposite name – it should have a ‘male’ in there too – and the issues that Hansberry raises, both directly and indirectly, remain pertinent in contemporary America with the #OscarSoWhite furore and the ugliness and popularity of Donald Trump’s rhetoric just two of the most recent examples. So it is a canny choice of revival for Sheffield-based Eclipse theatre company to tour the UK with, but it’s also a hugely satisfying dramatic one as well. Hansberry taps directly into the African-American experience, using her own family’s battles against segregation, to give us an alternative take on the American Dream, a family’s hopes and dreams refracted through the prisms of poverty, gender, race and above all, the growing sense that the way things are, ain’t necessarily how they gotta be. As one character says “Where are all going and why are we bothering?”, well let the Younger family show you. Ashley Zhangazha’s tightly simmering Walter Lee Junior wants to quit his job as a chauffeur and become his own business owner; his wife Ruth, a gorgeously eloquent Alisha Bailey, dreams of escaping their tramped two-bed apartment on Chicago’s south side; a superbly comic but also considered Susan Wokoma as his sister Beneatha has set her mind on becoming a doctor; and in the wake of her husband’s death, their mother Lena, a titanic turn from Angela Wynter, is waiting for the large insurance check that seems set to change their lives, not least by moving out to the predominantly white area of Clybourne Park.  This last point provides the most toxic and overt of the issues that the Youngers face, as the play’s only white character, a representative of the welcome committee from the new neighbourhood, visits to offer to buy them out of the new home even as he assures them “race prejudice simply doesn’t enter into it”. But Hansberry keeps her lens far wider, delving right into the complexity of intersecting factors like the societal pressures that undermine Walter’s masculinity as he struggles to become the leader of the house but haven’t yet allowed the feminist breakthrough to alleviate Ruth’s suffering, and Beneatha’s exploration of how much of a role African heritage has to play in American existence. Dawn Walton’s production is relatively unfussy, allowing the text to speak for itself in these unfalteringly powerful performances. And if it loses a little pace in the sometimes inelegant scene changes, the emotional breather they allow the audience is welcomed, not least in the aftermath of the turmoil that Wynter whips up with her every speech, whether lamenting the loss of a family’s legacy, scolding her son forcefully then nearly crumpling into remorse or cradling a plant, the ghost of a smile of immense satisfaction playing across her lips before a truly striking final image. A classic for all times. "
722,722,Ought To Be Clowns,06/05/2017,Ian,Pete ‘n’ Keely, Tristan Bates,"Emily Bestow’s technicolor set design for Pete ‘n’ Keely is one of those which fully exploits the transformative possibilities of the Tristan Bates’ black box, converting the space into a convincing evocation of a swingin’ Sixties television studio. That studio is currently home to pop duo Pete Bartel and Keely Stevens who soared up the charts with their winning charm and captured the hearts of a nation when they got married. Five years down the line though, fame has cooled, they’re divorced and the first time they’ve met up since, they’re filming a live reunion special on TV. Thus we get a variety show format that allows the pair to fill us in anecdotally on their shared past through the medium of popular song, at least when their barely concealed present animosity doesn’t interfere. For there’s a multitude of unresolved issues that need to be dealt with if they’re to make it to the end of the programme, never mind consider the future beyond it. Appropriately enough for the era, Pete ‘n’ Keely is a rather gentle show and Matthew Gould’s production here possesses a warmly nostalgic glow that is well essayed by performers David Bardsley and Katie Kerr. Their’s is an affectionate, if antagonistic connection (I was reminded at times of This Morning’s Fern and Phil) but James Hindman’s book struggles to provide much depth to their characters due to the relentless pace of the real-time format. Instead, the heavy lifting is done by the score which blends standards (‘Fever’, ‘Secret Love’, ‘Black Coffee’) with new songs by lyricist and composer Patrick Brady and co-lyricist Mark Waldrop to remarkable effect – under James Cleeve’s taut but expressive musical direction, you’re actually hard-pressed to tell the new songs from the classics (the wordplay of ‘The Cross Country Tour is a real stand out)."
723,723,Ought To Be Clowns,30/06/2014,mag9l,Great Britain, National Theatre,"It’s not quite Beyoncé releasing her latest album without prior notice but it’s not far off. Richard Bean’s new play for the National was something of an open secret even if its specifics were unknown but still, announcing it with five days’ notice and no previews is a pretty bold move. What Great Britain has going for it though is a right-up-to-the-minute immediacy as Bean responds with speed to the scandals that have engulfed certain sections of the tabloid media in recent times and a court case that may or may not have just reached a verdict… We’re in a satirical, pseudo-recognisable world – a ratings-hungry red-top (called The Free Press) is owned by a foreign-born media mogul who wants to buy a television station (an Irishman called Paschal O’Leary if you will) and has a fiercely ambitious news editor at its helm (a blonde woman called Paige Britain, she didn’t say she was “vindicated” so I have no idea who she was meant to be…). Manipulating their way to a position of huge influence with both Police and Parliament under their thumb, it seems nothing could go wrong. That is, until a little thing called phone hacking breaks into the national consciousness. As a comedy first and foremost, Great Britain dances around its subject with no little energy and a neat sense of humour. Front pages from rival newspapers such as The Guardener, The Dependent and The Daily Wail flash up on the video walls; the police are led by a particularly gaffe-prone Commissioner who becomes an unwitting YouTube hit; and some of the improbable scandals that are broken by The Free Press can’t help but raise guffaws. But Bean never lets his satire really cut that deep, there’s an affectionate feel to the unreconstructed vibe of the newsroom, a cosiness to the buffoons of the brass. And the more sombre strand of the plot – the investigation into missing young twin girls (an amalgam of the Maddie McCann, Milly Dowler and Sarah Payne cases) – never really gels with the humour as Paige tries to balance actually solving the case with the desire to sell more papers. A number of paedophile jokes fall flat (the danger with such topicality is that one is always in danger of being overtaken by the real news, in this case Rolf Harris’ guilty verdict) and though the play stretches out to 2 hours 45 minutes, the final quarter is distinctly rushed and many of the serious issues brushed under the carpet (though this was probably under legal advice as much as anything). So it’s not quite intelligent enough to tell us anything new about the whole affair or rather it can’t be as bluntly honest as it needs to be, nor is it really funny enough to be an out-and-out comedy (although many laughed more than me, if men in the closet are your thing…). As ever at the National, it is the performances that Nicholas Hytner’s production generates that really shine – Billie Piper’s steely-glinted gaze desperate for the top “it’s about being invited to the party…”, Robert Glenister’s salty editor “they weren’t lies, they were well researched stories that later turned out not to be true”; Oliver Chris’ too-honest policeman “he’s dead because of me”."
724,724,Ought To Be Clowns,22/02/2013,Ian,The Route to Happiness, Landor,"Over the next month, Aria Entertainment and the Landor Theatre in South London are hosting a whole season dedicated to new musical theatre writing – From Page to Stage – which features showcases, works-in-progress and workshops from a wide range of writers from across the globe. The programme also includes this world premiere of The Route to Happiness, a new intimate three-hander from Alexander S Bermange which runs for a week. And as befits a season of this nature, the show marks an interesting progression for Bermange as a writer, though not one without its challenges, and offers a brilliant showcase for some of our excellent talent. The Route to Happiness opens with three Londoners having their respective dreams of love and marriage, unlimited wealth and enduring fame dashed by circumstances and follows them on their attempts to build their hopes back up and get back in pursuit of the things that they think will make them happiest. So former banker Marcus seizes the opportunity to manage wannabe celebrity Trinity despite her lack of obvious talent, whilst also romancing author Lorna after an impromptu meeting at a wedding where she believes she may finally have found the one. Bermange’s previous writing has drawn heavily on the 80s and 90s musicals of his youth and his sweeping balladry and stirring anthems can be sampled on an extraordinarily well-cast CD of his songs Act One. And he indulges this in writing a similar suite of songs for Lorna, played here with full-throated verve by Shona White, whose determination to cling on to the hope of love seemingly drives her every move. There’s a strong comic edge to his writing too which comes out best in the gentle teasing of dim wannabe It-girl Trinity, unwilling and unable to accept that fame might not happen for her but given a beautiful warmth by Cassidy Janson, surely one of our strongest musical theatre actresses. And in the avaricious Marcus, Bermange stretches himself with a new mode of writing for him, a more modern and complex style which complements the other two both in forming a separate musical identity for the character and in creating a fascinatingly multi-layered sound in the group numbers, full of interesting harmonies. Niall Sheehy manages the often discordant lines of Marcus competently but struggles to make him a really engaging character and here, it is clear that the book needs a little more attention."
725,725,Ought To Be Clowns,17/01/2006,Ian,As You Desire Me, Playhouse,"We first meet Scott Thomas as Elma, a singer in a sleazy 1930s Berlin night-club and living in a sado-masochistic relationship with a man Salter and his lesbian daughter Mop who is also attracted to her. A man appears and tells her that she is, in fact Lucia, the wife of an Italian aristocrat. She was the victim of an appalling assault during the First World War and, as a result, lost her memory. But when she goes to Italy to pursue this dream new life, she finds unexpected problems and disappointments. Scott Thomas is just compelling as all the facets she is asked to play here, the Dietrich-like chanteuse and the casually elegant Italian lady-who-lunches, and she has to work hard: onstage for maybe 80% of the time and constantly aware of having to play the role that best pleases those around her. She is aided by some sumptuous design work taking us from a dark Berlin cabaret bar to a light-filled Italian villa with a cleverly enhanced large projection of Scott Thomas’ face facing us during the scene changes, constantly reminding us we really don’t know for sure who she is. Margaret Tyzack and John Carlisle almost run away with the show as relatives clinging onto happy memories; Bob Hoskins was disappointingly average, playing the same character one would expect him to as ever, but there was good work from Stephanie Jacob, Finbar Lynch and Richard Lintern as Bruno, the abandoned husband of Lucia."

727,727,Ought To Be Clowns,04/09/2014,Ian,Reptember – Triple Bill A, New Diorama,"The Faction theatre company have now become well established with their yearly rep season at the New Diorama so it was something of a pleasant surprise to see them pop up with something extra – Reptember, another rep season but this time made up of single-person shows. Over the next few weeks, they’re presenting three diverse triple bills, featuring new adaptations of some well-known works as writers and actors alike put a Faction-able spin on the world of solo performance. It’s a challenging evening to be sure, closer to three hours than two, but there’s wonderful variety within the programme as the three performances inhabit completely different aesthetics. First up is Kate Sawyer and Rachel Valentine Smith’s modern take on Lorca’s Duende, an “interactive lecture” on the profound forces that drive the soul of true artists. Its presentation (acted by Sawyer, directed by Smith) is ingeniously conceived and comes as a marvellous surprise. Suffice to say, it demands an expressively physical performance from Sawyer and she fully delivers, vividly entertaining but with a tragicomic note that blooms beautifully late on. Lorca may not have referenced Penélope Cruz, Simon Cowell or Nick Cave directly in his work but the updating is beautifully done and makes great artistic sense."
728,728,Ought To Be Clowns,21/11/2012,Ian,The Magistrate, National Theatre,"Aged 36, the widowed Agatha Posket feared for her re-marriage prospects so when the genial Aeneas Posket, the magistrate for the Mulberry Street Police Court, arrived on the scene, she lopped 5 years off her age and promptly became Mrs Posket. The only trouble is her 19 year old son Cis whom she tells the world is actually 14 in order to make her fib fly. The farcical trials that follow as he continues to act as a 19 year old and the arrival of his godfather threatens to undo the whole deception make up the plot of Arthur Wing Pinero’s rather delightful play The Magistrate, which takes up residence at the Olivier as the National’s Christmas offering in place of The Count of Monte Cristo. Nancy Carroll is simply sensational as Agatha, an actress in full control of her considerable gift and razor-sharp throughout. Whether layering in real pathos in lamenting the lot of a middle-aged widow, working in genuine comedy whilst extemporising wildly as chaos surrounds her or managing to make the spitting out of some bread into a moment of sheer genius, she is never less than unmissable. And she supported excellent by Joshua McGuire as her son Cis, who has a wonderful physicality and gleeful sense of timing in his teenage rampaging and Jonathan Coy’s family friend Colonel Lukyn who is pretty much scene-stealingly fantastic, a true master of comic acting which fully deserves the mid-show round of applause he received. Against these sublime farceurs, I ended up a little bit disappointed with John Lithgow. His titular magistrate starts off the play as a rather warm, avuncular figure and is a beautiful bumbler. The opening to the second act however upped the ante, leaving him with an extended solo full of over-acting, mime and physical stuff that felt rather forced and an unnecessary stretch (given the reaction, I suspect I’m in the minority in thinking this), especially as his acting is subtly funny enough not to need this extra level. The pull of the National means that the ensemble is stuffed full of luxury casting too, which is great on the one hand but I long for the day when we get to see the likes of Peter Polycarpou, Beverly Rudd and Christopher Logan in more featured roles as they all shone in smaller bit parts here. And I liked the efforts of relative newbies Alexander Cobb as a faithful manservant, Joshua Lacey’s comical constable and Christina Cole as Agatha’s sister Charlotte. The acting is top-notch across the board and the sense of joyous fun that comes across onstage is a pleasure to watch. However, director Timothy Sheader’s use of a chorus of dandies to provide occasional musical interludes through operetta-style songs composed by Richard Sisson and with lyrics from Richard Stilgoe is problematic. It’s undoubtedly an efficient way of setting the light playful mood of the piece, but they really do stretch out to an unnecessarily length, seriously affecting the pace of the play, and also suffer a little in comparison. Jamie Lloyd did the same thing more effectively on this same stage in She Stoops To Conquer and neither of those shows demonstrated half the ingenuity of the original songs that beautifully enriched the Southwark Playhouse’s recent The Busy Body. The final full-cast post-show number here though has an undeniable charm which ought to put a smile on everyone’s face as they leave the theatre. From the touring version of Dandy Dick and the Rose Kingston’s The Second Mrs Tanqueray to this and then onto the Donmar’s forthcoming Trelawny of the Wells, it seems that Arthur Wing Pinero is having something of a moment. With his predilection for writing good central parts for women, this has to be a good thing though having only now seen two of his plays, I’m left a little intrigued as to just what kind of writer Pinero actually is. Regardless, I would love it if someone to put on his 1899 play The Gay Lord Quex, though I doubt it would be as good as the version in my head…"
729,729,Ought To Be Clowns,01/03/2020,Ian,V+15, VAULT Festival,"In a society where totalitarian rule has become the norm, where would you find yourself? Writer Alina has thrown her lot in with the rebel alliance, working to overthrow the regime and she’s hoping that Vincent, a fellow creative and broadcaster who has been radio silent for the last couple of years, will become the latest recruit to their cause. Jo Sutherland’s V+15 probes at differing notions of morality, shaped by years of oppression and censorship and asking whether freedom of speech carries the same weight under such circumstances. And as events threaten to overtake them, Alina and Vincent have to question whether debate can effectively turn into direct action, if need be.  Sarita Plowman and Gianbruno Spena do their best to build up their characters but there’s no mistaking that they are weighted down by an extremely verbose script. More crucially, the writing feels too often shaped around talking points rather than stemming from character, which stifles much of its development."
730,730,Ought To Be Clowns,18/09/2016,mag9l,A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur, Print Room,"Given the amount of writing that Tennessee Williams produced – not a year goes past without a premiere of some new short play or other by him – it’s no surprise that there’s a good deal of his work that falls into the little-performed category. A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur is one such play, written in 1976 and now revived at Notting Hill’s Print Room, directed by Michael Oakley. In a St Louis, Missouri apartment sometime in the 1930s, a group of women spend a sweltering Sunday preparing for a picnic, illuminating as Williams so often does, the precarious nature of women’s place in society. All four are single but at different stages in their life and naturally it is the youngest – civics teacher Dorothea – who is the driving force, believing she has the most at stake. After a dalliance with the handsome Ralph Ellis in the backseat of a car, she thinks she’s set for the future. Her older flatmate Bodey and colleague Helena know better but each have strikingly different plans for their friend, the one thing in common is that they don’t want to end up like the strange Miss Gluck from upstairs. And that is pretty much it, familiar themes reworked but with little of the subtlety that characterises the best of Williams’ work. Oakley does his best to invest the material with depth, aided by a strong cast, but they have to overcome a clumsily comic, almost caricaturish, vibe. Debbie Chazen’s maternal-ish Bodey and Hermione Gulliford’s brittle Helena give impressive portrayals of the middle-age of which Laura Rogers’ Dorothea is terrified, obsessively working through her keep-fit routines even as her dreams of romantic bliss slip further away, "
731,731,Ought To Be Clowns,05/04/2016,mag9l,X, Royal Court,"True story – every time someone raves about Pomona, a new fan of Miss Saigon is born. The determination to force a new world order from the unlikely starting spot of the Orange Tree Theatre has meant that Alistair McDowall now has that unfortunate albatross of hype firmly attached to his neck and thus his new play X, opening at the Royal Court, comes burdened – a little unfairly – with the weight of expectation. And I have to say for me, it’s hard to tell whether they’ll be met or not. Perhaps predictably, X is a curious, slippery beast that wilfully toys with notions of audience satisfaction, in that it really doesn’t care whether you ‘get’ it or not. Set on Pluto, the crew of a small research base have lost contact with Earth and are left waiting. For what exactly, they don’t know. And after two and a half hours or so of Vicky Featherstone’s production, neither do we. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing (no matter what certain critics might tell you). After the gruelling but exhilarating emotional challenge of the second act, when McDowall finally drills down to the essence of the audacity and strangeness that characterises the best of his writing, X is a powerful play that has a lot to say in a very particular order, or is that no particular order. For we’re constantly being wrong-footed and not just by the queasy angle of Merle Hensel’s design. Time is broken, identity is fluid, words and phrases echo and flow from one character to another as something of a puzzle that feels solvable emerges in the first act. But McDowall is playing with us, there is no (easy) solution, X doesn’t mark the spot and it’s not quite satisfying. Return after the interval and it’s like moving from medium to killer level Sudokus, the gradual stripping away of what has so far counted for normality moves past frustrating to become incredibly gripping."
732,732,Ought To Be Clowns,13/04/2017,Ian,Limehouse, Donmar,"I know a bit about a few things but for some reason, UK politics has never figured that highly on the list. So whilst Steve Waters’ new play Limehouse might well be familiar territory for the vast majority of the matinee audience I saw this with, for me it was a bit of a history lesson. It was also a bit of a challenge as I’d skipped lunch and the smell of the pasta bake being made onstage left me near-ravenous! Limehouse follows a small group of Labour politicians as they despair at the militant leftwing direction their party is taking and try to decide what, if anything, they can do about it. Perhaps not accidentally, parallels can be drawn with the situation at the moment but this drama is set in 1981 and the quartet are Bill Rodgers, Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins and David Owen – the Gang of Four who went on to form the SDP. Any doubts I might have had about being ill-informed were soon covered by the fact that this is an extremely wordy play, the four – plus Owen’s wife Debbie – essentially chew the cud around the kitchen table, filling us in on the socio-political landscape and gearing up for intermittent, individual barnstorming moments. There’s a lot of speechifying and director Polly Findlay mitigates this by casting to the hilt but there’s still something inherently undramatic about it all."
733,733,Ought To Be Clowns,23/01/2015,Ian,King Lear, Holy Trinity Church,"In something of a coup, Guildford Shakespeare Company’s leading man for their production of King Lear is none other than Brian Blessed. And with his daughter Rosalind playing Goneril too. The play’s opening this week was a little overshadowed by the actor’s collapse during the final preview performance, but with the redoubtable resilience we have come to expect from this totemic figure (and perhaps unfairly so, he is 78 after all), he continued with the show after a 20 minute break. So three days later, it was with a little trepidation that we took our seats in the Holy Trinity Church in Guildford (cushion recommended!). But we needn’t have worried, Brian Blessed giving his King Lear was exactly how you’d imagine Brian Blessed giving his King Lear would be. For better and for worse. There’s a real thrill in seeing him throw himself so fully into the cantankerous cruelty and wild abandon that characterises Lear’s breakdown – every howl, headshake and handwring is vastly exaggerated and is so unmistakeably him. But this comes at the loss of much subtlety, if not wailing he’s whispering with inbetween, which ultimately becomes a little exhausting whilst remaining trashily enjoyable. I mean look at the poster, what you want is Brian Blessed doing exactly what Brian Blessed does. Director Caroline Devlin thus has her work cut out in building a production around him but with some sympathetic casting, does a good job. Rosalind Blessed’s fiercely confident Goneril is well-judged. Whether draping herself over the throne in her father’s absence, striding across the stage in a brassière having had her way with Oswald or Edmund or presumably anyone but her husband, or making said husband – Simon Hepworth’s Albany – recoil from her very touch, she’s a remarkable stage presence. Sarah Gobran’s Regan brings a different kind of malevolence, a conniving wheedling sort that is no less manipulative or eye-poppingly horrific in the satiating of her bloodlust. There’s also some neat touches from Devlin that resonate strongly. Emily Tucker doubles as Cordelia and The Fool (in a Cabaret-esque get-up) which amplifies the tragedy of both their fates, and James Sobol Kelly’s Gloucester’s love of astrology allows for some of the more elegant design flourishes of the evening from Neil Irish’s design and Declan Randell’s star-flecked lighting. That said, there’s also some less adroit decisions as in the finicky level of scene dressing (who knew Shakespeare needed garden furniture) and the schlocky music which frequently threatens to tip the camp balance into overload."
734,734,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2014,mag9l,Stevie, Minerva,"The quality of theatre that the Chichester Festival Theatre produces on a regular basis can barely be questioned. Big musicals aside, it may rarely be heart-thumpingly exciting or shine with innovative flair, but rather the focus is on meticulously constructed productions of the more traditional side of drama. Which goes to say that CFT couldn’t be more MOR if it tried, at the top end of the middle of the road to be sure, but still lacking something of a cutting edge. In some ways, it might be an unfair suggestion. Christopher Morahan’s production of Hugh Whitemore’s 1977 play Stevie is impeccably put together and features a fantastic performance from Zoë Wanamaker at its heart but the speed at which that heart races rarely gets above resting pace. The Stevie of the title is Stevie Smith, a poet and author who has been somewhat forgotten, whose work sprang from the minutiae of her daily life and the play goes about realising moments from that life. So we never leave the suburban haven in Palmers Green that she shared with her beloved aunt but for the flights of fancy in Stevie’s mind. Wanamaker skilfully shows us how poetry was a vital means of expression for this woman, often addressing the audience directly and pulling us into her world where Lynda Baron’s aunt is a beautifully realised presence, a graceful and sensitive depiction of how small pleasures become huge with advancing age."
735,735,Ought To Be Clowns,13/09/2012,Ian,The Magic Flute, ENO at the Coliseum,"The ENO’s production of Mozart’s The Magic Flute returns to the Coliseum for what will be its final ever performances. And in this Engilsh-language version – now remarkably 23 years old – originally directed by Nicholas Hytner with this revival with Ian Rutherford and James Bonas at the helm, the combination of fairytale adventuring, earthy comedy, magical instruments and glorious singing still casts an enchanting spell of huge enjoyment. I particularly love that seeing the show reminds me of what to me, is one of the biggest incongruities in opera. One of the most famous tunes from The Magic Flute, possibly one of the most recognisable arias in all opera, is the Queen of the Night’s second act aria is “Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen” whose crystalline trills are impeccably, gorgeously sung here by Kathryn Lewek and generally sound just heavenly. But the title actually translates as “Hell’s vengeance boileth in mine heart” and in it the Queen urges Pamina to kill a man or else she won’t consider her her daughter any more – not quite what one might have expected from listening to the gorgeous coloratura. Random Australian accents in productions seem to be the thing of the moment – one pops up in Three Sisters too – here, it belongs to charismatic sidekick Papageno played with great openness by Duncan Rock, who swaggered rather memorably through the recent gayed-up version of Don Giovanni. He clearly revels in the informality he brings to the role and the connection thus built with the audience, even encouraging a most inopportune marriage proposal at one point and he is matched well by the characterful Rhian Lois as his intended, a very welsh Papagena. Shawn Mathey’s Tamino, the male lead, suffered a little by comparison though it is essentially just a duller character but partnered by Elena Xanthoudakis’ shining Pamina, there is undeniably strong quality at work here. The broadening of the comedy – though it may make some baulk – is particularly well-essayed in the Three Ladies who attend the Queen of the Night. In vivid blue costumes and towering wigs, there’s something almost G+S about them, Jeremy Sams’ translation lacking perhaps a little finesse here but never any wit, and Elizabeth Llewellyn, Catherine Young and Pamela Helen Stephen convey humour well through their acting as well as through excellent singing."
736,736,Ought To Be Clowns,15/06/2012,Ian,Summer and Smoke, Southwark Playhouse,"Yet another rarely performed Tennessee Williams play has made its way onto the London fringe, in this case it is a short run of Summer and Smoke at the Southwark Playhouse. But it was in the Vault rather than the main house and directed by Rebecca Frecknell with little appreciation for the acoustics of this particularly unforgiving space (which as a deaf person I have previously found to be rather challenging) and so after suffering with not being able to hear much of what was going on or indeed figure out what was happening, I bailed at the interval. If you want to know what it was like, read this review instead."
737,737,Ought To Be Clowns,12/09/2013,Ian,For Services Rendered / Carnival, Radio 4,"Timing is everything and the anti-war message of Somerset Maugham’s 1932 play For Services Rendered failed to gain any purchase on contemporary audiences, making it something of a failure. But listening to Lu Kemp’s adaptation for Radio 4, it strikes as an extraordinarily prescient piece of work, more so given the eventual declaration and devastation of the Second World War, and it surely due for a substantial theatrical revival. As it is, this version will more than do for now as its tale of how the impact of the First World War lingered perniciously on in the lives of the nation is embodied in the trials of the Ardsley family and their friends. Leonard and Charlotte Ardsley have four children and though superficially their lives in the Kent countryside are going well, there’s much trauma and difficulty just beneath the surface. Only son Sydney was blinded in the war and sister Eva has devoted herself entirely to his care, much to the expense of her own situation and youngest daughter Lois also finds herself unmarried due to the lack of prospects. Ethel is the one that did manage to secure herself a husband but the upheaval of wartime blinded her to his eminent lack of suitability and now in peacetime, she is left to repent at leisure. With so much bubbling away as the social order decays, it isn’t long before changes start to force themselves upon this group. It is powerful stuff, full of archetypal English repression and bucolic rebellion as Eva and Lois in particular decide to seize the initiative in what looks like it could be a brave new world, but find that the rest of the world hasn’t quite caught up to them. Cath Whitefield’s Eva is the picture of a frustrated do-gooder, unable to comprehend why her kindness to others hasn’t resulted in personal happiness; Louise Brealey makes a good fist of the flighty Lois, willing to do almost anything in the face of such limited opportunity; and there’s excellent work too from Siân Thomas as their mother, Justin Salinger as a former naval officer ill-equipped to survive in the real world and Michael Schaeffer as Ethel’s flirtatious lower-class husband. Definitely recommended."
738,738,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2018,Ian,How To Be A Kid, Orange Tree,"It’s a mark of Paul Miller’s reinvigoration of the Orange Tree that it doesn’t feel too much of a surprise to hear Katy Perry and Little Mix playing in the theatre as you enter. In this particular case it is for a play for seven- to eleven- year olds but still, it feels wonderful that this artistic director has introduced this note of unpredictability to this Richmond institution. Sarah McDonald-Hughes’ How To Be A Kid arrives here as part of Paines Plough’s trio of Roundabout Plays (along with Black Mountain and Out of Love), a co-production with Theatr Clywd and the Orange Tree which uses an ensemble of three actors to deliver three shining examples of new British writing. And as the opening salvo in the three-show press day, it proved an entertainingly strong start. In an unassuming opening section, McDonald-Hughes captures much of the innocence of the things that provoke childhood wonder – choosing your favourite dinosaur, variety packs of cereals, trips to McDonalds, any deviation from the standard routine like baked beans on crackers because there’s no bread. And skilfully from there, she weaves a tale of how children accommodate such changes, especially when they are the result of something altogether more serious.  For due to her mother’s struggles with mental health, twelve year-old Molly has to fill in the gap, characterising it all as a series of big adventures – having to go and live in care for several weeks, returning but ending up having to act in loco parentis for her younger brother Joe. And as exciting as making a new best friend who loves Taylor Swift as much as she does is, or attempting to learn new skills like making dinner out of whatever is in the fridge, they’re also a terrible weight for someone so young to bear and James Grieve’s production captures this with sensitivity and insight. Katie Elin-Salt is achingly moving as the wide-eyed Molly in all her slow-bubbling emotional turmoil, Hasan Dixon looks like he is living his absolute best life pretending to be a triceratops as Joe, and Sally Messham does incredibly well at differentiating any number of minor supporting characters. And even if the show is particularly aimed at seven- to eleven-year olds, it has something to say to us all  – as with all the best writing for children, How to Be A Kid feels impossibly wise."
739,739,Ought To Be Clowns,20/12/2016,mag9l,Saint Joan, Donmar,"Dealing with an amusing take on the egg crisis of the first scene, and using Skype to correctly identify Fisayo Akinade’s spoiled manchild heir of a Dauphin in the next, the modern take is clever but there’s a strange tension that never quite resolves. The text has been cut but not completely modernised, so talk of battles and forts sit alongside the rise and fall of stocks and shares and it doesn’t settle into an interpretation that didn’t leave me going ‘you what now’ until it starts to play the drama straight as in the English plot to bring about the downfall of the woman uniting the French against them.  
From then on, through the trial and its aftermath, the production soars, mainly on the strength of Arterton’s superlative performance. A woman alone, literally so in this all-male company, Rourke emphasises this through bathing her in an almost holy glow from Howard Hudson’s lighting. And her demeanour is beautifully subtle – perhaps inspiring more wonder than overt warmongering – the way in which she tenderly strokes the cheeks of the men around her, who find they can rarely resist, makes you understand the fear she inspires in the establishment that she challenges. That establishment is well-characterised by a strong cast. Elliot Levey’s cleric Cauchon and Jo Stone-Fewing’s scheming Warwick brilliantly play the lengthy debate that takes us up to the interval, exploring the fear of rising nationalism and heresy that she represents to them, whilst Richard Cant’s Little Englander de Stogumber froths at the mouth with his copy of the Daily Mail next to them. Hadley Fraser’s Dunois and Rory Keenan’s Inquisitor also stand out and it is salutary to see Arthur Hughes, an actor with a physical disability, take so central a place in the company too. "
740,740,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2012,Ian,Outward Bound, Finborough,"Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers. One of the difficulties of writing about shows is the balancing act between trying to give enough information to give a palpable sense of a production without giving away too much of it to preserve as much of its revelatory nature as possible. Major plot points are frequently given away in reviews, especially of classics (which always strikes me as a little arrogant, this idea that because the reviewer has seen the play 60 times doesn’t mean that the reader necessarily has – I loved the surprises that King Lear held for me when I saw it for the first time last year), but then the act of writing about theatre lends itself to detailed analysis which can’t afford to be coy. The plot of Sutton Vane’s 1923 play Outward Bound hinges on a major revelation, not so much in a whodunit sense but rather in the direction that the play then takes. It comes fairly early in the show and so when debating this issue, my companion thought it would be ok to mention it in the review, but reading the blurb on the production, the enigma is preserved and I think I prefer it that way round. But I suppose there’s then an element of me having my cake and eating it here – in not wanting to talk about ‘it’, I’ve flagged up its presence something rotten! But anyhoo, to the show in hand. The first play in this year’s Rediscoveries season, which has previously unearthed some beauties like Accolade and The Potting Shed, Outward Bound was a huge success in the 1920s both here and on Broadway yet has languished a little since then, not appearing in London for over 50 years. Set onboard a ship and predominantly in the smoking room of one of its bars, seven of its passengers meet up as the ship is about to set sail. But as they set about establishing who’s who and what the social arrangements are, odd little moments keep happening, a strange air comes to pervade and it turns out that the voyage is not quite the one they were expecting. The cross-section of English society presented here is given largely delightful form by the cast: Carmen Rodriguez as an upper class snob, Ursula Mohan’s salt-of-the-earth cleaner, Paul Westwood’s lanky parson, Derek Howard’s bullish politician, all provide colourful portrayals and strong performances. David Brett’s barman is enigmatically good fun as a man who knows more than he is saying, but it is Nicholas Karimi’s wag Tom Pryor who is the driving force of the ensemble, the first to twig what is going on and often at the emotional heart of the questions of morality that ensue."
741,741,Ought To Be Clowns,20/08/2013,Ian,Fences, Duchess,"The role of the anti-hero is a curious one – featuring a protagonist who sours and curdles as the play progresses is a bold move, especially when presented with such a lack of sentimentality as in Paulette Randall’s production of August Wilson’s Fences. There’s no doubting the horrendous circumstances that black people found themselves in even after the abolition of slavery, in a world that had emancipated them yet still considered them way less than equal. This is given visceral life in the lead character of Troy Maxson, whose own promising baseball career was stymied by the enduring racism he faced and an inopportune trip to prison and so as life has progressed and a family built up around him, he has ended up providing for them by becoming a garbage collector. But Troy is a hugely proud man and the scars of his experience linger on perniciously, affecting the lives of all of those around him even as the opportunities for his sons become greater than anything he was ever granted. Lyons is a great musician but his father refuses to go and see him but the younger Cory bears the brunt of his father’s frustrations as his talent for American football puts him in line for a scholarship, a chance Troy decides to sabotage. Even his marriage to the ever-faithful Rose comes under threat in his search for the satisfaction that constantly eludes him. He’s a hugely flawed human being and Lenny Henry starts off well at suggesting the bluff bonhomie of a family man who loves a drink and a son, but as the layers peel back to reveal the deeply troubled character below, I found him less convincing. He nails the impotent rage – humiliating Cody whenever he can and frequently roaring to God – but never really hit the notes of deep tragedy that I craved. The fences of the title are designed to protect his property, but it is only a property he could afford by purloining his brother’s war disability pay-off, and also to cordon off his family, the people whom he beats and cheats on. Henry struggles to convey the damage of his early years in a way that engaged me, his lifeless hands symptomatic of the lack of complexity necessary to make an anti-hero worth watching. "
742,742,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2020,Ian,After(s), White Bear Theatre,"It’s a little known truth that when two men kiss for the first time, Dolly Parton will start playing. Or so Scott Mackie and Santino Smith would have you believe in a witty moment early on in their new play After(s). It’s also a bit of a misdirect as where you think you might be getting a play that explores sexuality, it soon shifts that onto the back-burner as it delves into other issues. The play is mainly an exploration of how no good can come from mid-week drinking, when recklessness crashes into responsibilities. Andy has just finished a long day in the office when he bumps into his best-friend-from-high-school-back-in Paisley-Yog and as a catch-up pint turns into shots into clubbing into afterpartying, the carefully ordered pieces of his London life come tumbling down around him in the most farcical of manners. Cos despite that illicit smooch on the sofa, Andy is engaged to high-flyer Sarah and he wants to propose to her tonight. Yog however is determined to continue their afterparty shenanigans into a second evening and as he ropes in pizza-delivery-worker-and-so-much-more-besides Laura and finds a stash of MDMA, everyone ends up reconsidering their future – too much for a Wednesday night, right? Not when you’re young and living in the city… Mackie and Smith’s writing has a wonderfully electric charge about it, their ear for authentic dialogue perfectly tuned to that point in your mid-twenties where society strongly suggests you should be confidently on the rise  when in reality, more often than not, you’re barely keeping your shit together – the pressures and realities of young adulthood sometimes just too much to bear. Whether ostensibly at the top of the ladder (as in Lucy Heath’s nicely unspooling Sarah) or the bottom (Laura Singleton nailing the unpredictable energy of Laura),  Smith’s Yog finds comfort in regressing to happier high-school times and sticking at the same pub job in Paisley he’s had since he was 16, whereas Mackie’s Andy has literally remade himself in London. Yet both are somehow trapped, trying not to show that they’re flailing and never quite sure what they are going to say when they open their mouth. Consequently, they’re both always frantically scrabbling to do/say/find the ‘right thing’ – it’s hilarious but also moving, even in the daftest depths here."
743,743,Ought To Be Clowns,23/10/2016,mag9l,The HIV Monologues, Ace Hotel,"So we meet the blithely unaware Alex who tries to escape through the bathroom when a hot date reveals his status, Irish nurse Irene who tackles the stigma of working with AIDS patients in the 1980s with a near-unimaginable compassion, Nick who is a recently diagnosed HIV positive man struggling to come to terms with what that means and Barney, whose life is reinvigorated by the arrival of ARV medication in the 1990s. And as they tell their stories, of the love and hope in their worlds as well as the fear and frustration, connections make themselves clear. These are narrative – Alex is Nick’s date, Irene is caring for Barney’s lover, Nick auditions to be in a play written by Barney etc etc. But they’re also achingly thematic – the intolerance faced by those shattering conservative societal norms, the challenges people face in finding reliable information, the unexpected ways in which grief hits us.
It would be hard to do otherwise but director Luke Davies ensures the emotional intensity of The HIV Monologues hits with pinpoint accuracy through an excellent cast. Denholm Spurr’s puppyish Alex matures before our very eyes, even as his cock and his conscience do battle; Charly Flyte is extraordinary as Irene, the 80s stigma she counteracts still as difficult to listen to as ever; and Sean Hart’s quiet self-loathing as Nick is desperately, affectingly, sad. And in something of a coup, Jonathan Blake (one of the first people to have been diagnosed with AIDS in the UK and whose story inspired the film​ Pride) marks a return to the stage after 30-odd years with a highly moving performance as Barney, which will render you incapable of ever looking at an orchid the same way again."
744,744,Ought To Be Clowns,29/06/2012,Ian,The Only True History of Lizzie Finn, Southwark Playhouse,"Perhaps better known as a novelist (A Long Long Way and The Secret Scripture have both been Booker-nominated), Sebastian Barry’s 1995 play The Only True History of Lizzie Finn receives its UK premiere here at the Southwark Playhouse in a production by award-winning director Blanche McIntyre. Having carved a niche for herself as the most celebrated dancer in Weston-Super-Mare, Lizzie Finn finds herself swept off her feet by an Irish soldier returning from the Boer War. Despite their completely different backgrounds, they return to their homeland anticipating married bliss but at a time when changes in the land laws are causing huge societal changes in Ireland, life is far from easy.     The play is not without its challenges. Made up of sequences of short scenes, sometimes just a few lines long, the rhythm of the production is something that takes getting used to: James Perkins’ design of wide steps, whilst effectively evoking the seafront, doesn’t seem particularly well-suited to the format. But in the rather impressionistic approach by McIntyre, moments of visual grace emerge from these scenes, like embers spiralling out of the fire, flashing brightly and disappearing into the dark. I particularly loved the doubling of actors at the Castlemaine’s dinner party to create a witty echoing of an earlier scene.   Likewise, the structure means that characterisation isn’t necessarily that straight-forward here,  the playwright bravely leaves much unsaid, making the audience work just a little harder to piece together the shards of character that he does present. Consequently there’s something of an enigmatic quality to Lizzie herself, Shereen Martin’s luminosity belying the innate toughness of the woman who has endured much in her working-class background to get to this point and she always leaves us with the sense that there is more to be revealed – this is truly a woman ahead of her time. Justin Avoth’s Robert matches her well, as he works through his own post-war stresses, theirs is a class-defying relationship we root for though the production could have done a little more to emphasised how ostracised from society they were. As it was, it’s Robert’s mother Lucinda, Penelope Beaumont in quietly dignified form, who shoulders much of this responsibility yet the character doesn’t quite feel substantial enough to take this weight. Lucy Black’s Can-Canning comrade Jelly Jane is a beautifully played performance, Karen Cogan threatens to steal every scene she is in as the ditzy maid Teresa – memorably described as being like “two buckets banging together” – and Andrew Macklin’s bird-calling is a thing of a genius."
745,745,Ought To Be Clowns,08/04/2011,Ian,Pagans, Royal Court,"Last up in the set of rehearsed readings for the International Playwrights Season was the play Pagans by Ukrainian Anna Yablonskaya. This reading was overlaid with great sadness when it was revealed that the playwright was killed in the Moscow Domodedovo Airport bombing on 24th January 2011 on her way to collect a prize for the screenplay of this very play. It had been scheduled well before her tragic death and the decision was never in doubt to continue with it as a beautiful tribute to her life and work. Directed by Simon Godwin and translated from the Russian in which she wrote by Rory Mullarkey, Pagans follows the impact of the return of Natalya Stepanovna, long-estranged from her son Oleg, on his family, in particular his over-worked wife Marina and awkward university-dropout daughter Kristina, and other people in their life. They are all non-believers but she is fervently religious and though they are initially sceptical of her desire to bring Jesus into their lives to save them, they soon find out that the Lord (or is it Natalya) works in mysterious ways. It is hard to be truly objective about someone’s writing knowing that they have passed away, and with it being in such a horrific manner and so recently there’s an added sensitivity, but in this 90 minute play it was clear to see why the Royal Court team were so excited by working with her. Her writing for her female characters in particular was extremely strong, giving voice to a full-rounded portrayal of different generations of modern Russian women, Helen Schlesinger being particularly stunning here as the acerbic Marina and Isabella Laughland finding a quiet beauty in Kristina’s tortured soul. But Yablonskaya also extends this to her older characters and so Natalya, played brilliantly by Annette Badland, though ostensibly an interfering busybody is given a beautiful warmth and genuine humanity. Dealing with matters of religion and questions of faith this way with such a disarming lack of scepticism or patronising of the characters, Peter Polycarpou’s Bosun was another example of this, was most interesting to see and quite the rarity in terms of new writing especially in this country, making Pagans a most fascinating piece. So a great tribute to Yablonskaya’s talent but also to the diligent efforts of Associate Director Elyse Dodgson whose tireless work in supporting and nurturing playwrights from all around the world is a truly marvellous and inspiring thing and her influence in promoting the production of overseas work here in the UK should not be underestimated. I have loved the variety of theatrical voices that have been on show here and combined with the opportunity to see some top talent reading them too, it has made it an unmissable few weeks: the next season will be eagerly anticipated."
746,746,Ought To Be Clowns,02/12/2018,Ian,Ladykiller, Pleasance,"That there was something special about Madeline Gould’s Ladykiller was obvious even in the 15 minute format I saw it in three years ago as part of The Thelmas’ Ladylogue. So to see it all grown up to nearly an hour in length and having smashed an Edinburgh Festival run to huge acclaim, feels like a well-earned victory for a striking piece of story-telling. Directed by Madelaine Moore and acted by Hannah McLean, this monologue takes us right through the wringer in the aftermath of a bloody murder. At first sight, it was the chambermaid, in a hotel room, or was it…? Gould and McLean toy brilliantly with our expectations as our protagonist presents her case and we buy into it. Cos she’s a woman innit.  
But we’re quickly disabused of our preconceptions, exposed for the hypocrites that we are in allowing such gendered portrayals of the world to permeate so fully. And McClean’s timing is expert as she carefully excises all of this to reveal the psychopath beneath – Gould neatly suggesting we all have one deep down. "
747,747,Ought To Be Clowns,28/05/2018,Ian,Red, Wyndham’s,I was a fan of Red when it first played London back in 2010 and so was pleased by the news that Michael Grandage would be reviving that Donmar Warehouse production for a belated turn in the West End at the Wyndham’s. Take a read of my four star review for Cheap Theatre Tickets here.
748,748,Ought To Be Clowns,22/04/2012,Ian,Babes in Arms, Union,"“I love the theatre, but I never come late” In some ways, this tale of the exploitation of unpaid interns working in a theatre could be considered a timely revival looking at the ethics of the industry. But though that is the pretext of Babes in Arms, it is a much more whimsical piece than that – a 1937 Broadway musical from Rodgers and Hart, frothily light in plot but musically superlative in places, brimming with standards like ‘The Lady is a Tramp’, ‘Johnny One Note’ and ‘My Funny Valentine’. This production uses a revised book from 1959 by George Oppenheimer in which a team of bright young apprentices toil away at a struggling theatre, falling in and out of love with each other at the drop of a hat and secretly rehearsing a musical revue which they hope to put on. It’s undoubtedly a candy-floss ball of a plot but cheerfully and entertainingly staged in David Ball’s production with Sam Cable’s sharp 3-man band and splendidly enlivened by the interjections of Lizzi Gee’s suitcase-wielding and delightfully tap-heavy choreography. A largely young and fresh-faced cast cleaning up ‘backstage’ as we enter the auditorium, the percussive noises from their chores leading neatly into the first rendition of the tuneful ‘Babes in Arms’ and out of the ensemble, appealing performances do emerge. Catriona Mackenzie makes a kicky heroine out of Susie who only has eyes for James Lacey’s Valentine (as in My Funny…), who in turn is mooning over visiting actress Jennifer, Carly Thoms in sweet form. But the eye is really caught by Ben Redfern’s charismatic Gus, well partnered by Anna McGarahan’s buxom Terry in the delightful I Wish I Were In Love Again and by Jenny Perry’s Bunny, the put-upon co-owner who blossoms under the spotlight and delivers some of the best songs with the straight-forward earnestness that shows like this need to in order to succeed."
749,749,Ought To Be Clowns,03/04/2014,mag9l,I Can’t Sing, Palladium,"One of the most profitable television franchises in the UK, a much-loved comedian writing the book, a £6 million budget…there’s clearly considerable heft behind the latest musical to establish itself in the London Palladium. But the marriage of Harry Hill’s bizarre comic sensibility, Steve Brown’s bright if hollow score and the ITV juggernaut that is the X-Factor makes for uneasy bedfellows, Sean Foley’s garish production eschewing any kind of subtlety for the broadest kind of populist swoop. I Can’t Sing is a show that constantly wants to have its cake and eat it. Faux-Dermot presenter Liam O’Deary gets a laugh by exasperating at one point “I don’t know why you might be charged” when the phone lines have closed, presumably the response “because they continue to make money for the production company” was mixed in previews. The TV show’s heavy reliance on tear-jerking backstories is a running gag yet nothing dispels the myth that that is the way to get noticed on a talent show. Likewise the qualifications of the panel to be judges of a popular music contest are skewered yet they remain feted as a special brand of celebrity. Steve Brown’s score occupies similar territory. For a TV show that relies on churning out covers of the same old songs every year, the choice to go with pastiche for the music here is a brave one. There’s an Eminem rap, a Beyoncé ballad, Europop trash, a disco diva moment, a Rat Pack number, but precious few moments of genuine musical theatre. The title song has vocal fireworks but no soul, the number constructed solely out of clichés lacks real wit beyond the concept, only the Act 1 closer has the driving force of a full company number that befits the budget that has been bestowed upon this production. Contemporary references are scattered throughout but rather than making the show feel up to date, they feel painfully, calculatedly studious. Benefits Street, Embarrassing Bodies, selfies, onesies, babies (Cowell’s), even the show’s well-publicised troubles in its preview period all get a cursory look-in, feeling like they’re being ticked off a list rather than fully integrated into the book. When it does achieve that, as in the cringing ‘I Miss You Already”, the bubbles of text speak that appear on the wall feel like your dad’s version of how the kids speak. Hill’s surreal sense of humour somehow feels hemmed in here, missing the mark more often than hitting it. Simon Bailey’s Dermot impression is brilliantly well-observed yet he’s not given enough to say that is actually funny, Victoria Elliot’s Cheryl-a-like Jordy has a great joke involving the word ‘pet’, and Nigel Harman’s legs are put to good use as a silky Simon. But forced to avoid an impersonation – Cowell’s presence as producer can’t have helped – it’s never quite silly enough, given how daftly the show ends, why doesn’t a look from him actually make people instantly pregnant? Throw in a security guard who is funny because he has a Nigerian accent and a camp producer who is funny because he’s gay, and one gets a sense at which denominator we’re operating."
750,750,Ought To Be Clowns,01/07/2018,Ian,The Greatest Wealth, Old Vic,"It’s no exaggeration to say that I wouldn’t be here but for the NHS – it changed my life as a young boy, it saved my life as a teenager who didn’t look both ways. A story I imagine which finds resonance with so very many of us in the UK but as this venerable institution marks its 70th birthday, it finds itself under siege more than ever. So what better time to reflect on what has been, what is and what yet might be for our National Health Service. Curated by Lolita Chakrabarti and directed by Adrian Lester, The Greatest Wealth took the form of a series of specially-commissioned world-premiere monologues, each responding to a particular decade of the NHS’s existence. Exploring the myriad ways in which it has become an integral part of the social and economic fabric of the nation, it proved a varied and thoughtful evening. Highlights for me were Meera Syal’s Rivers, a sensitive but searing look at the experience of the Windrush generation in the 1960s, the extent of the grace under pressure that was necessary to put up with virulent racism whilst caring for people at their most vulnerable. And Matilda Ibini’s Choice & Control, performed by Ruth Madeley gave powerful voice to the life-enhancing opportunities that NHS provision has offered to so many. Plus any night that contains the many talents of the likes of Sophie Stone, Dervla Kirwan and the heart-rending Jade Anouka can’t be too bad. The programme was threaded together with snatches of glorious song from Gloria Obianyo (who made me actually want to hear ‘Angels’ again, only her version though) and Dylan Townley at the piano. And translated with real quick-footed brilliance by BSL interpreter Jenny Peters, dealing adroitly with a fair few line calls from the guys, all part and parcel of these kinds of events. And then bringing the whole thing together with a sprinkling of unexpected magic, Seiriol Davies’ musical contribution – The Nuchess – was a heartfelt tribute that was a perfect bookend. Delivered with a warm cabaret flourish by Louise English, its wry sense of humour and the direct, clear-eyed sentiment of its chorus (quoted up top) encapsulated the evening perfectly. Reminding us of how much we have gained, reminding us of how much we stand to lose."
751,751,Ought To Be Clowns,25/11/2016,mag9l,Catch Me, Above the Arts,"The traditional image of musical theatre as clap-happy tap-dancing extravaganzas is one that still persists, even whilst musicals about living with cancer play at the National Theatre. And it is something that clearly occupies writers Arnoud Breitbarth and Christian Czornyj, as their introduction in the programme for their new show Catch Me tackles this issue head on.  For Catch Me is a musical based around male suicide, the mental health struggles that lead people to such an act and the repercussions it has on those left behind. And pleasingly, Breitbarth and Czornyj show a strong understanding of the musical form and its storytelling potential. Here, songs tumble out of the characters, depicting their mental state, an organic extension of the story that really works, especially in the stronger first half. Dean’s fiancée, sister and brother-in-law, best friend and work colleague are still reeling from his decision to take his own life and as they gather on the eve of his burial, there’s a brilliantly conceived sequence right up to the interval that brings together all the stilted awkwardness of funeral chit-chat and its amazing black humour. It also teases out the hidden secrets that they all possess, whose cumulative weight Dean found hard to bear. Breitbarth and Czornyj’s score for piano, cello and guitar, emotively led by Rebecca Grant’s musical direction, has a real elegance to it, typified by the flowing vocal lines of the title number, knowingly reprised twice (and consequently I can still sing it back now!). And it is sung well by a strong company – Kathryn Pemberton’s grieving fiancée Sarah, Jennifer Tilley’s spiky sister Christine and in the comic perforamnce of the night – Matthew Munden’s helplessly crass workmate Marc."
752,752,Ought To Be Clowns,27/01/2014,Ian,Blind / Doing the Business, Courtyard,"The issue of sponsorship in the arts is one which is fraught with difficulties in a seemingly unwinnable quandary no matter how big or small – the RSC were hauled over the coals for accepting money from BP in light of their environmental disasters in 2012, Look Left Look Right were castigated by this reviewer for establishing commercial relationships, yet neither scenario really addresses the desperate reality of shrinking revenue streams and funding avenues. Nor too does this double bill of Doug Lucie plays, the oft-neglected British playwright focusing on what effect commercialisation has on the art itself. First up is a fierce two-hander in 1990’s Doing the Business where a new artistic director of a forward-thinking theatre has a meeting with an old Oxbridge buddy who is now an archetypal yuppie and grant-giver extraordinaire. The problem is the strings that come with the money which are tantamount to complete artistic control. There’s not much subtlety here but then that isn’t Lucie’s intent. Matthew Carter’s Peter is a brash businessman who is the very embodiment of commercialism, more than happy to fund an entire season as long as it is filled with populist work and any cutting edges – like a playwright who dares not to demonise the IRA – are sanded away. Carter revels in his red-socks and braces appallingness and Jim Mannering counters him well as the increasingly less keen director. Blind is a more recent work, originally a radio play from 2002 and edited by Lucie in 2014 for this stage premiere, and is located in the high end of the art world, dominated by the sly demeanour of the Saatchi-like Paul Stone. He’s been touting the raucous talents of his Emin-like YBA Maddy Burns, a blisteringly bold performance from Janna Fox, but his fickle tastes – and those of the functionaries who follow him blindly – are tempted by the prospect of hot new painter Alan."
753,753,Ought To Be Clowns,10/12/2017,Ian,Little Women the Musical, Hope Mill,"Finally made my first trip to the Hope Mill Theatre, Manchester’s fringe powerhouse which has been firing transfers down to London with quite the regularity. I wanted to experience the theatre for itself though and having heard great things about Little Women the Musical, didn’t want to miss out in case this is the one that doesn’t actually make its way south (although it should, it really should!). With a book by Allan Knee, music by Jason Howland and lyrics by Mindi Dickstein, this musical version of Louisa May Alcott’s much-loved novel is a wonderful piece of adaptation. Streamlining plot whilst simultaneously enriching character, it translates the travails of the four March sisters into a warm and witty couple of hours and naturally makes you cry just as much it gladdens the heart. Bronagh Lagan’s production brims with playful inventiveness, much aided by Nik Corrall’s design, but the ace up its sleeve is its casting (big credit to casting director Jane Deitch). Between them, Amie Giselle-Ward’s Jo, Katie Marie-Carter’s Amy, Cathy Read’s Beth and Jemima Watling’s Meg make up a beautiful affecting quartet, respecting the characters as written but imbuing them with fresh energy too. So Giselle-Ward is unafraid to push Jo right to the limits of her frankly often intolerable behaviour, and locates a real pathos in learning to deal with the consequences of her impulsiveness, a beautiful study in the complexities of discovering your true self. It makes you quite understand Marie-Carter’s Amy is so spiteful and why Read’s excellent Beth has learned to become quite the peacemaker. Meanwhile Watling’s Meg is a step removed as the eldest, especially once her swoon-worthy connection with Joel Harper-Jackson’s Mr Brooke is made."
754,754,Ought To Be Clowns,07/11/2015,mag9l,The Winter’s Tale, Garrick,"Perhaps one of the biggest lures of the newly established Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company and its year-long residency at the Garrick Theatre is the return of Dame Judi Dench to the stage, playing Paulina in their opening production of The Winter’s Tale. One of the pre-eminent Shakespeareans of this or any age, the run largely sold out in advance proving the astute business sense but with Branagh and Rob Ashford co-directing this oft-described problem play, does it make artistic sense? And I’m not 100% sure that it does, this doesn’t feel like a production that one will remember as a classic of our time. It is undoubtedly a difficult play to mount, the chilly stateliness of the first act’s Sicilia contrasting strongly with the permissive post-interval (and 16 years hence) Bohemia and with a rambling plot full of statuesque tragicomedy, it’s a hard one to love. Branagh and Ashford keep things more or less traditional, and of course excellently spoken, but rarely soul-stirringly good. Branagh’s Leontes, King of Sicilia, treasures the friendship of Polixenes, King of Bohemia, but his distrustful nature gets the better of him when he begins to suspect that his heavily pregnant wife Hermione has been getting too friendly with him. Casting rough contemporaries Hadley Fraser and Miranda Raison offers one potential reason for this as they skip off skating together and roots Leontes’ irrational jealousy in a place of insecurity. But it does remain irrational, we never really understand why he pursues his loved ones with such terrible vengeance and as Branagh dials up the histrionics, it is increasingly less incumbent upon us to care. Surrounded by Michael Pennington’s Antigonus, John Shrapnel’s Camillo and Dench’s Paulina, the verse has never sounded so mellifluously meticulous but for me, sitting way back in the rear stalls in the not-even-worth £15 cheap seats, there was a crucial lack of emotional engagement. So by the time the austere Edwardian aesthetic of Christopher Oram’s set is overturned for the pastoral pleasures of a gypsy-influenced Bohemia and it’s the turn of the next generation of these royal frenemies to cavort (albeit not knowing who the other is), tolerance is severely tested by numerous song and dance numbers. And as Perdita and Florizel, love’s young dream and the potential of redemption personified, Jessie Buckley and Tom Bateman are both anaemically underpowered."
755,755,Ought To Be Clowns,26/07/2017,Ian,Girl From The North Country, Old Vic,"Semantics to one side though, I absolutely adored this. Within a couple of songs I had already made a mental note to work out who to invite when I go again; within three, I had decided who was going to get next year’s Olivier for Best Actress in a Musical (Sheila Atim); by the interval, I was texting all and sundry to get themselves booked in whilst half-decent seats are still available. And all to see a Bob Dylan musical!  McPherson, also directing, has set the play in Dylan’s birthplace of Duluth, Minnesota in 1934 and centred on a guesthouse owned by the Laines. It’s a focal point for the community to come together, guests shuffle in and out with their own mini-dramas but the Laines have plenty of their own – mountains of debt, a wife suffering from dementia, a husband conducting an affair in front of her, a pregnant daughter…more than enough to fill a play, or a musical. It’s a busy play, packed full of sorrow and soul, rueful realism and tentative hope, and is blessed by a crack cast filled with the likes of Ciarán Hinds, Shirley Henderson, Ron Cook, Debbie Kurup, Stanley Townsend and many more. But it is in the music where the show ascends to greatness, soaring on Simon Hale’s exceptional work in orchestrating and arranging a choice selection of Dylan’s songs for the band of four plus the actor-musicians of the company (check out Bronagh Gallagher on the drums). The songs may not advance the narrative as in a book musical but they are utterly essential to the mood of Girl From The North Country, suffusing it with the requisite atmosphere and moody bite to deepen the storytelling. Atim’s ‘Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)’ is a pure, scintillating moment of magic, Henderson tearing up ‘Like A Rolling Stone’ is heart-racingly good, every note Debbie Kurup sings is as wearily heartfelt as you could ever hope, and there’s a beautiful duet but the programme doesn’t say who sang what so I’m not 100% sure what it was (think it was Gene and Katherine). Rae Smith’s deceptively simple design sets the scene(s) with a minimum of fuss and is gorgeously lit by Mark Henderson, especially when Lucy Hind’s movement comes into play, elegant silhouettes holding positions and if they occasionally evoke the lyricism of John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett’s work, is that so bad a thing? (The answer is no). I don’t know how Dylan fans will receive this treatment of his music (you can hear some of it here), I imagine hardcore McPherson fans might feel short-changed but I have to say this absolutely hit the sweet spot for me – one of my most favourite shows of the year so far.       "
756,756,Ought To Be Clowns,27/11/2011,Ian,Inadmissible Evidence, Donmar Warehouse,"Inadmissible Evidence focuses in almost exclusively on Bill Maitland, a lawyer whose life is falling apart. Everyone important to him seems to be abandoning him, work colleagues, the numerous secretaries he’s sleeping with, his angsty daughter, and he exists in a bubble of self-obsessed torture and suffering – nicely realised in Soutra Gilmour’s office set that highlights his isolation – and presumably on the way to some sort of nervous breakdown. Douglas Hodge is thus never off the stage in a marathon of a performance that rarely lets up: he’s desperate to be the life of the party yet prey to numerous neuroses; unable to really connect with anyone yet constantly talking and raging at them; in this world it is all about him and so the play becomes all about him too. Such focus on Maitland means that the rest of the ensemble have to work extremely hard to make any sort of meaningful impact in the production, Osborne’s writing not helping them a great deal. Daniel Ryan fares best as colleague Hudson, Serena Evans triples up effectively as a series of clients and Al Weaver makes a quietly moving study of his married man arrested for cottaging. But Esther Hall is completely wasted as final mistress Liz, given the merest opportunity to shine as she does extremely well here and Karen Gillan did not seem quite equal to the task as the secretary who has just had enough, coming across as flat and unresponsive, especially up against Hodge."
757,757,Ought To Be Clowns,10/07/2018,Ian,Always Right There, RADA Festival,"It is always tricky to respond to a piece that doesn’t quite work for you. And when it is one that is as suffused in the #MeToo movement as Natalia Rossetti’s Always Right There is, it is even more so, I’m a cis man as well FFS. So how to step around such an issue? As sensitively as possible and acknowledging any inherent bias. As the third of the headline shows at this year’s RADA Festival, it is clear that much work has gone into the show. Rossetti’s focus is on sexual harassment, at the level that seemingly permeates every level of society and yet is not deemed serious enough (for the most part) to be worth reporting. These are delivered in vignettes from the participants of a spin class and broken up by slices of everyday dialogue between two millenial flatmates. Samara Gannon’s production uses a split-screen style to switch easily between the two. And the intent is clear, demonstrating the ways in which overt harassment becomes internalised, accommodated, made unexceptional as part of everyday life. But in its execution, the combination never quite clicked for me. Even at this length, it felt overlong, repetitious as it underscored and underscored its points rather than advancing argument or insight."

759,759,Ought To Be Clowns,10/01/2014,Ian,Tell Me On A Sunday, St James,"And it really is unnecessary – the hour-long show is perfectly encapsulated, whipping through the trials and tribulations of an Englishwoman in New York who is running away from a broken heart in the UK but finds herself unable to escape romantic drama. And Webb owns its every emotional contour – the aching sadness of the title song, the yearning romance of ‘The Last Man In My Life’, the anguished dexterity of ‘Let Me Finish’. Lloyd-Webber’s song-writing is rarely better than here and Black’s lyrics have a well-honed simplicity which allows for a directness of feeling, especially when given such transcendental grace as here."
760,760,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2017,mag9l,Hearing Things, Omnibus Clapham,"It can be easy to make grand, sweeping statements about the artistic vision of your theatre company but much more difficult to actually follow through. So it is impressive to see Playing ON, who “make theatre with communities whose voices are seldom heard”, do exactly that with their new play Hearing Things. Developed from five years of careful and painstaking collaboration with the staff, patients (and their relatives) from mental health institutions including the Maudsley and Homerton, playwright Philip Osment draws back the curtain just a little on the world of psychiatry. Reflecting the broad scope of its source material, and perhaps hinting a little at the experience of mental health issues, the multiple stories Hearing Things tells are fractured, their pieces shuffled out of order as the company of three actors dip in and out of a range of characters. It’s a brave approach but one which is directed with great fluidity by Jim Pope, making great use of a reconfigured auditorium with Miriam Nabarro and Jemima Robinson’s in-the-round staging creating a really playful space, for even though mental health is a weighty subject, there’s flashes of real humour here too.  
Osment’s play thus approaches its issues from all sides – everyone agrees that the NHS is being stretched way beyond its capabilities, suggesting the knock-on effect of challenging the mental health of the central psychiatrist Nicholas. Which speaks to one of the wider themes here, that anyone can experience mental distress, no age, class, gender or colour lines here, and that modern society needs to find a way to be more open about this, the need to properly consider the ‘health’ aspect of mental health (speaking of – whether by coincidence or design – it is #TimetoTalk day on Twitter)."
761,761,Ought To Be Clowns,09/05/2020,Ian,Pieces of String, Mercury Theatre online,"For all that I’ve been recommending many of online theatre options to all and sundry, I haven’t actually partaken in many of them myself. In many cases, it has been shows I’ve seen before that are being featured and there’s an element of not wanting to sully their memory there; there’s also a sadness that theatregoing as we knew it might not be returning for the longest time. But then Colchester’s Mercury Theatre came up with the VE Day treat I was actually waiting for, a showing of their 2018 hit musical Pieces of String. I had a ticket for this, and a train ticket come to think of it but for the life of me, I can’ remember why I ended up not making it, so this rare opportunity to finally see a show that I hadn’t seen and wanted to see was much welcomed.  And most pleasingly of all, it was pretty darn fantastic. In some ways it couldn’t disappoint as it features so many of my favourite things – dual timestreams, queer romances, wartime stories that aren’t set on the battlefield, Andy Coxon’s voice – and Gus Gowland’s book, music and lyrics combines them all into a bittersweetly beautiful chamber musical, expertly directed by Ryan McBryde. "
762,762,Ought To Be Clowns,05/03/2016,mag9l,Don Quixote, Swan,"It’s a tough job being an actor junkie. Even whilst trying to cut down on the amount of theatre I see, I find it immensely hard to turn down the opportunity to watch long-admired actors in the flesh, hence dragging myself to see A Christmas Carol for Jim Broadbent, overriding my Pinter-averse instincts to book for Timothy Spall in The Caretaker, and heading to Stratford-upon-Avon to see David Threlfall return to the RSC, over 35 years since he was last there. Drawing him back is a new adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes’ Don Quixote by poet James Fenton (pulling the focus a bit in marking the 400th anniversary of someone else’s death) that is filled with mayhem and music and madness and melancholy. Determined to translate the world of chivalry of which he has read so much, Don Quixote sets out on his own quest to become a wandering knight, carrying out acts of derring-do with his hapless squire but finding that fictional romantic ideal increasingly hard to come by. Angus Jackson’s production runs riot in a way I haven’t seen the RSC do too often and it allows for a brilliant sense of informality to rule the evening. Jackson’s direction allows for the ensemble to have many a richly scene-stealing moment and with a fair amount of ad-libbing going on (it must be hard to control things flying from the gods to the stage…) and audience interaction peppering the scenes (beware, you could end up babysitting a seriously freaky-looking baby!), there’s a real freedom to much of this work. This approach suits Rufus Hound’s Sancho Panza down to the ground, bantering away with the audience, and with Gemma Goggin’s fierce wife at hand too, her roving eye looking for the perfect childminder, the stalls have never felt so dangerously fun. I enjoyed seeing Eleanor Wyld onstage again, starring in a standout moment of real pathos. But it is Threlfall’s performance that holds the attention, very much putting the tragi- in tragi-comic as the tale winds to a pretty devastating conclusion, that achingly moving voice hushed in long-awaited recognition of true nobility. Robert Innes Hopkins’ design is full of real invention, Grant Olding’s songs suggest the Spanish locating without being overemphatic, even the puppetry (Toby Olié) didn’t disturb me too much… From windmills to wooden horses (no comment on the actors actually playing horses! Natey Jones is excellent here), flying bread to fabulous monks, Don Quixote has it all. And in enticing Threlfall back onto the stage, celebrates Cervantes’ masterpiece with a magnificent piece of acting from an actor I’d definitely travel to see again. "
763,763,Ought To Be Clowns,14/08/2014,Ian,Dogfight, Southwark Playhouse,"After the extraordinary success that was In The Heights, the Southwark Playhouse have gone for another American musical theatre import in the shape of 2012’s Dogfight. But whilst expectations were high – something heightened by the auditorium being in the same configuration as for that previous show, the reality fell far short. Peter Duchan’s book, based on the 1991 film of the same name, follows a group of boisterous marines in San Francisco on the night before they’re due to fly out to Vietnam as they look to maintain the (dis)honourable tradition of holding a dogfight. As we come to realise, their version of a dogfight is distinctly unpleasant, a cruel game played on unsuspecting women and though he is a part of this world of pent-up testosterone and hints of sexual violence, the young Eddie Birdlace soon comes to regret his choice of victim – a sweet waitress called Rose – and tries to make amends, though whether this is because he has fallen instantly in love with her or he has spotted an easy way to get laid on his last night is anyone’s guess. So what is trying to be a sweet love story is overlaid with this troubling sour note throughout. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul’s score is pleasant in its melodic pop way – the band led by George Dyer serve it well – but it severely lacks any real sense of narrative propulsion. Thus many of the songs have a static quality that stultifies the pace of the show – the ‘bum bum bum’ refrain of First Date Last Night is a case in point, by the third time it is hard not to despair of the (repeated) wasted lyrical opportunities. And whilst their strengths lie in the quieter, more emotionally stirring numbers, they don’t do enough to capture the darker side of the whole affair, to try and make us understand the roots of the men’s behaviour rather than simply accept it because they’re about to be slaughtered. Matt Ryan’s production also suffers from a couple of misjudged decisions. Try as it might but manliness is rarely successfully evoked through the medium of musical theatre and Lucie Pankhurst’s chirpy choreography is hardly the ideal way to suggest life in the Marines, especially once we discover the deep misogyny that lies at the heart of their evening plans. Likewise when they’re finally shipped off to Vietnam, the version of war we see is sadly amateurish, the necessary gravitas conspicuous in its absence. As for the baffling inclusion in amongst the dancing ladies, either own it or hide it properly."
764,764,Ought To Be Clowns,11/12/2013,Ian,Ushers: The Front of House Musical, Hope Theatre,"A Britney Spears jukebox musical with Marti Pellow as Kevin Federline and Michael Ball as Britney’s mum? Stranger things have happened on a West End stage but this is the (as yet fictional) set-up for Ushers: The Front of House Musical which follows the hope and dreams and frustrations and failures of a front of house team on a busy night at a West End theatre. And naturally it is playing at a fringe theatre, London’s newest in the form of The Hope Theatre, perched atop The Hope and Anchor pub on Upper Street and the only such theatre to be committed exclusively to new writing. And with Ushers, it has alighted on something of a little delight. The story may be slight but it manages to pack a lot in in covering the travails of four long-standing ushers, a newcomer into their ranks and their overwrought supervisor. The new girl and the hot guy immediately fancy each other, the cute gay couple are struggling with one of their’s decision to take an acting job in Austria, another girl can’t keep from tweeting pictures of the cast and the supervisor has gone power-mad at the prospect of schmoozing with a major new potential investor. And as these mini-dramas play out, James Rottger’s book makes light-hearted yet astute observations about the theatre industry in all its warts and all glory, poking fun at ince-cream prices, officious critics, pesky bloggers, frustrated actors, merchandise-obsessed middle managers and wannabe stars. It is frequently laugh out loud funny (although the West End Whingers probably deserve a credit for having their most famous pun nicked). And Yiannis Koutsakos’ score is tunefully essayed on Michael Riley’s keys, some very solid songwriting suggesting an interesting future for this creative team. Not everything works – the frequent diversions into a management-style presentation quickly become tiresome and don’t add enough of anything to warrant breaking up the narrative as they do. And though this is a brand new space, director Max Reynolds’ blocking is poorly done given the configuration of the seating, whole swathes of the action completely ignore the fact that it isn’t an end-on production. When he does remember this, particularly in the sequences that open and close the show, the potential for both show and venue really does come alive though."
765,765,Ought To Be Clowns,22/05/2011,Ian,Many Moons, Theatre503,"Set over a hot summer’s day in Stoke Newington, Many Moons is Alice Birch’s debut play showing at the Theatre503 in Battersea. Following four people whose isolated metropolitan existences circle round each other, their stories threatening to collide in the scorching heat of a village fête in Abney Park with potentially devastating effects. Birch is a graduate of new writing schemes at both the National and the Royal Court and with her first full-length production marks herself out as a talent to watch with a highly witty yet poetic play of great maturity and dramatic intrigue. Edward Franklin’s nervy, nerdy Ollie is a bundle of barely-socialised but still endearing energy as a young man trying to break free from a life of dull Oxford academia and dark matter to try and find something new in London. In the flat next door, Esther Smith’s effervescent Juniper is an irrepressible perma-smiling ball of positivity, newly moved down from the Midlands and unshakeably sure that love and life have great things in store for her. Jonathan Newth’s Robert is preoccupied with caring for his Parkinson’s-suffering wife but he still has deep desires of his own. And in a house across the road, Esther Hall’s heavily-pregnant and unhappily-married Meg is wrestling with her feelings of unfulfilment and channelling her time and energies into dealing with a world of suspicions. Birch’s writing here is extraordinary in its ability to encapsulate the worlds of these four people, physically so close yet emotionally estranged, and her eye for the nuances, detailing and quirks of human behaviour, especially with the modern sensibilities here, results in some moments of comic genius. There is the funniest joke about toast I have ever heard and Smith’s daffy Juniper is full of sparklingly daft non-sequiturs but it all works because of the emotional honesty of her characters, acted excellently as they are without exception, so that we’re fully invested in them from the start. There’s a great sense of location that will please anyone familiar with Stokey but Birch also shows a great skill for the art of revelation and as the swelteringly hot day progresses, the mood is twisted just brilliantly – but to say more would ruin it for you!"
766,766,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Lucid / Knock Knock, RADA Festival,"Lucid is an attempt to make corporeal the elusive hinterland that are our dreams. From anxiety about weddings, exams or if you’re wearing any trousers to the expression of unexpected sexual desire, from the fulfilment of your deepest wishes to something as mundane as getting a glass of milk, it’s all here and more as the unknowable terrain of the subconscious is deftly explored.  To describe the show as highly physical is to do it a real disservice. It is a constantly surprising, often breath-taking kaleidoscope of endeavour that I found utterly compelling from the off. From the way in which each of the five-strong company embody different kinds of alarms to the sheer abandon with which bodies are flung, clambered over, and contorted to create any number of scenarios. And as physically impressive as it all is, it is clear that Lucid is deeply considered too. The final sequence is properly, laugh-out-loud hilarious but other sections mine a vein of darkness that David Lynch would be proud of, unafraid to explore the kind of symbolism that might well frighten us. So all credit to Stefanie Bruckner, Dean Elliott, Tom Kelsey, Jo Moss and Katariina Tamm and I’m definitely recommending this one, I might even try and go back myself! Knock Knock was equally wordless, but an entirely different kettle of fish in the world it depicted. Devised and performed by Hot Coals Theatre, with the avowed aim of creating highly visual shows that are d/Deaf and Hearing inclusive, it turned to the world of dark fairy tales and woodland magic to present us with a world free from the need for conventional language, either signed or spoken. Jo Sargeant and Clare-Louise English play an open-hearted pair of forest dwellers who, on meeting, fall hard for each other’s charms, building the kind of relationship that works for them. But as ideas of gender norms and societal expectation encroach on their idyll, the strength of their connection is tested. Using their own idiosyncratic performance style – part clowning, part physical theatre, part straight-up-storytelling – they nail it."
767,767,Ought To Be Clowns,20/11/2016,mag9l,Women Centre Stage: Power Play Festival – Women on the Edge,,"The Women on the Edge session of the Women Centre Stage: Power Play Festival featured three works that were commissioned and developed from the 2015 festival held at the National Theatre. This just happened to include one of my favourite pieces from across the entire day – Camilla Harding and Alexandra Sinclair’s Man Up! Deceptively simple in its format yet deliciously complex in its subject matter, the pair give the lie to conventional gender norms and make a fabulously compelling case for the importance of recognising gender fluidity in society. Their stagecraft is ingenious too, transformations subtly worked so that they were halfway complete before you clock exactly what’s going on. Judith Jones and Beatrix Campbell’s Justice has no such ambiguity about it, an emotionally bruising look at the lasting impact of the Cleveland child abuse scandal and the trials its victims face in trying to escape its shadow, in search of a truth, a resolution that might somehow set them free. Directed by Ros Philips, Claire-Louise Cordwell’s damaged warrior of justice is a brilliantly thorny part and contrasted well with Kathryn O’Reilly’s softer but no less fierce budding campaigner."
768,768,Ought To Be Clowns,21/10/2013,Ian,Titus Andronicus, Arcola,"The 80s appear to be fertile ground for reinterpretations of classics – recent weeks have seen Romeo and Juliet in Camden market and Sweeney Todd above a greasy spoon, utilising the societal upheaval of the time as a backdrop, and so too does Zoé Ford with this unique and exuberant take on Titus Andronicus. Using This Is England as a key reference point, this is a world of viscerally tribal skinheads and goths (standing in for the Goths) and one in which the enraged pursuit of bloody vengeance feels entirely appropriate. This is a production that is broad, ballsy and extremely bloody. David Vaughan Night’s Titus is all bovver-booted swagger, Maya Thomas’ cogent Lavinia is distressingly tragic and Rosalind Blessed’s vibrant Tamora is a commendably strong presence as the two warring factions trade rape, murder, mutilations, even cannibalism, as the stakes and everyone’s pride remains too high to entertain anything but the most desperate fight to the end. "
769,769,Ought To Be Clowns,31/08/2012,Ian,Soho Cinders, Soho Theatre,"Technically speaking, Soho Cinders is a new musical. But given that some of the songs were first premiered at a Stiles + Drewe concert and subsequently released on CD and that the musical itself received a concert presentation late last year, it feels more like the return of an old friend. Though in the way that you can’t always control when friends come back into your life, this fable-like gay retelling of the Cinderella story was booked into the Soho Theatre in the middle of the summer. Cinderella here is Robbie, a law student who works as an escort on the side and his Prince Charming is James Prince, a bisexual candidate in the London Mayoral race with whom he has been carrying out a clandestine affair. Anthony Drewe and Elliot Davis’ book retains much that will be recognised, like ugly stepsisters, but has also taken a bit of a spin on things, Buttons has become Velcro, the carriage becomes a Boris bike and the story has generally been modernised to cover the world of politics and sex scandals. And it is mostly a very charming affair. I’ve long been a fan of the score, it ranks amongst Stiles + Drewe’s most tuneful and accessible – augmented by at least one new song here – and lyrically, it sparkles with sharp wit and sweet feeling as the tangle of secret romances, sexual confusion and futilely-held torches spills out and of course resolves itself neatly in the kindest of ways. It is the kind of show that can get away with it, just about, with a great sense of humour coming through from all angles, but especially from the filth of the stepsisters who are just hilarious. The role of the narrator, which I had assumed was just for the concert when we saw Sandi Toksvig doing it at the Queen’s, has also been incorporated into the show and Stephen Fry’s dry tones used (although as he has been recorded, the lack of spontaneity feels like a real missed opportunity) to pass acerbic comment on the goings-on. Casting-wise, several people reprise their roles from the concert: Michael Xavier brings his customary leading-man charm to James Prince, something of a difficult character whose bisexuality shouldn’t hide the fact he’s a bit of a cad; Amy Lennox is wonderful as the down-to-earth Velcro, hanging off Robbie’s every word; and Beverly Rudd and Suzie Chard chew up the stage, the audience and everything in-between as the ugly sisters who get many of the best lines. Stepping in for this run, it’s a pleasure to see Jenna Russell on the stage again, even if the role of Prince’s fiancée Marilyn is a little thankless, and Tom Milner as Robbie doesn’t quite have the presence or vocals to really command the stage and make us really care about the central relationship, though he’s not far off. So largely very enjoyable and the inclination is to forgive much of the randomness – the casual acceptance of Robbie as a rent boy, the secret couple choosing to meet up in the middle of Trafalgar Square… What one is not inclined to forgive is the ticket pricing which has risen to West End levels – £37.50 for unreserved, uncomfortable stalls seating –a most unfortunate development indeed. I like this show very much and I’d love to be able to recommend it, but if you were to ask me is it worth that much, I’d have to regretfully say no, buy the CD instead."
770,770,Ought To Be Clowns,16/02/2013,Ian,Chess, Union Theatre,"With music from Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus  of ABBA and conceived by Tim Rice who also contributed the lyrics, the 1980s musical Chess had grand ambitions which have never really come to fruition as it remains a show that has been revised as often as it has been revived. This new production at the powerhouse of intimate musical theatre that is the Union is a version which has been sanctioned by Rice himself as the definitive version of this story of a love triangle in the world of international chess competitions set against the backdrop of the Cold War. But the potency of an intimate venue has to be carefully captured in order to make it truly work and this is where Chess comes a little unstuck. Ryan Dawson Laight’s design has recast the Union into a shallow thrust, the size of the theatre meaning that most of the seats end up on the sides. Not an issue at all in and of itself but Laight has a large platform take up most of the space at the rear of the stage and so much of the action is forced forward and this, combined with co-directors Christopher Howell and Steven Harris having the performers play predominantly straight ahead, results in a production that too rarely engages with the vast majority of its audience. For the handful of eight or so people facing the stage head-on, it must be marvellous but if the theatre were full, more people would actually see Florence’s back than her face during the bruisingly raw final scene – that two directors can misuse such an intimate space this way is certainly problematic.  It is largely well performed though and for the female roles, the casting is pretty much perfect. Sarah Galbraith’s Florence – the woman who looks after one grandmaster, the American Freddie, but falls in love with his main rival, the Soviet Anatoly – brims with restrained feeling and quiet passion, able to beautifully deliver both the power of ‘Nobody’s Side’ and the delicacy of ‘Heaven Help My Heart’ within a heartbeat of each other. Natasha J Barnes has a glorious impact on the second half as Anatoly’s abandoned wife Svetlana and if their duet on ‘I Know Him So Well’ is a little safe in its prettiness, Barnes smashes it on ‘Someone Else’s Story’. And in a gender-swapped role, Gillian Kirkpatrick makes a vivid impression as Molokova, Anatoly’s KGB-friendly second. There’s a little less success with the men. Nadim Naaman definitely has the rich vocal for the conflicted Anatoly but plays him with a touch too much reserve, one longs for a greater emotional depth to drive the character along. But Tim Oxbrow shows the strain as his rock vocal can’t always quite meet the challenges of Trumper’s part and Craig Rhys Barlow fails to make The Arbiter a sufficiently controlling presence in the story, he’s often just lost in the crowd of the company. It is clear though that the male roles just aren’t as well written, leaving the actors to fight an uphill battle.  Simon Lambert’s six-strong band sounds better when the strings are higher in the mix than the more general homage to the 80s that never lets us forget when the show was written and though there are several classic songs in the show, the score as a whole has a wearying familiarity which is not helped by the dour nature and heavy-handedness of Tim Rice’s lyrics. And so though the show’s reputation may leave one questioning why it has taken so long for a revival to come back to London, the reality is clear to see that it is a somewhat problematic piece of theatre. This production addresses some of those issues and pulls together a female cast that is well worth the effort of securing a ticket, but also poses problems of its own to create a decidedly mixed bag."
771,771,Ought To Be Clowns,20/09/2011,Ian,Street Scene, Young Vic,"Winning the Evening Standard Award for Best Musical even with a short five-show run in 2008, Street Scene now returns to the Young Vic for a slightly longer run on The Cut, the final preview of which I caught, and followed by a tour. This 1947 show occupies a strange ground between musical and opera as composer Kurt Weill incorporates musical influences from all over the place: Broadway show tunes, operatic arias, folk ditties, jazz, blues and a whole lot more besides. And so to do it justice, director John Fulljames has assembled a company of 80 singers, the main cast complemented by a community chorus from the local area. The book by Elmer Rice, adapted from his own play, is set over a couple of scorchingly hot days in a New York tenement building, occupied by a wide mix of ethnic groupings all dealing with their own crises and looking for a way out to a better life. The slice of life approach means that the eclectic score makes more sense, ricocheting around the diverse inhabitants and the multitude of stories that are touched upon before the action coalesces around the Maurrant family and their particular travails. The strongest of these is the story of Mrs Maurrant, played with a gorgeous openness by Elena Ferrari, a woman longing to be loved the way she loves and determined to get it. That she finds this comfort in an affair with a travelling salesman rather than with her hard-drinking husband, a menacingly gritty turn from Geoffrey Dolton has the tongues of the neighbouring housewives wagging and the kids on the blocks teasing her young son Willie, but under the broiling sun, things get much darker (it is an opera after all…) At the same time, her teenage daughter Rose is also dealing with matters of the heart, batting away the advances of a lecherous boss tempting her with a Broadway career and negotiating the more fragile charms of the bookish but sweet Sam, the Jewish boy from next door: Susanna Hurrell and Paul Curievici both sounding excellent here but not quite pulling me under with emotion. And indeed, I never quite lost myself in the drama of the storytelling of the whole thing. For me this was partly due to the way in which the elements of the show didn’t always blend: at one point a character even says “you can’t mix oil and water”. The kaleidoscope of the first half went on for too long before focusing on the central characters and there’s just not enough lyrical clarity at several key points – it always sounds gorgeous but the focus feels more on the singing than the acting. But then when things are calmer, one is hit by the banality of lyrics like “Rose, you are wearing a black dress” at what should be a moment of high drama and searing emotion: the balance between operatic intensity and the greater flexibility of musical theatre never quite settling for me and allowing me to fully engage with the plight of these characters. Parts of the ending troubled me too as we pulled back a little from the Maurrants’ plight, I couldn’t quite see the point being made around the eviction of one of the families and the lack of community spirit thus shown and what about poor Willie?!"
772,772,Ought To Be Clowns,04/12/2018,Ian,Austentatious, Savoy Theatre,"Spreading festive cheer all month long at the Savoy, Austentatious’s Christmas season got off with a bang (ooh vicar) with the saucily inclined Carry On Follow That Carriage. As ever, trying to describe the experience of watching a lost Jane Austen come to life in front of you is to be on a hiding to nothing but among the joys here were erotic flipbooks, bible polishing, dogging in Stevenage, the joys of a reverse flicking and – don’t tell PETA – all kinds of avian murder.  "
773,773,Ought To Be Clowns,01/05/2018,Ian,Nine Night, National Theatre,"Grief is universal, but the world of Natasha Gordon’s debut play Nine Night is entirely specific. When Gloria, the grandmother of a Jamaican family passes away, her London home becomes the focus of the Nine Night ceremony, wherein the local community and family of the deceased gather to mourn the passing but also to celebrate the life with love, laughter and no small amount of rum. But nine days of a wake can take its toll on a family under strain and here, Gordon sets up an archetypal family drama. The sibling resentful of being the one who shouldered the burden of caring, the sibling who wants to sell the house quick because of money troubles, the other half-sibling who got left behind… Plus the ever-present remnants of the older generation who never stop fussing, and a secret pregnancy to deal with, tensions just keep rising.    Roy Alexander Weise’s production is beautifully calibrated, constructing an entirely convincing microcosm of this family and all its easy chemistry, and allowing the way Gordon depicts the multiple and minuscule ways in which grief creeps up on us all to be beautifully played out. We never meet Gloria but she’s as fully-rounded a character as any of the ones onstage, given wonderful life through warm reminiscences and hilariously meticulous detail.   As the saying goes though, if you don’t laugh you’ll cry. And the time for crying comes with the cracking-open of family secrets, the airing of uncomfortable truths, the exposure of the rawness and depth of feeling that all possess but few are sharing. A ferocious intensity is unleashed in the latter third of the play which is spine-tingling in its potency and should make a believer out of even the most sceptical.  Rightfully taking no prisoners, Gordon’s dialogue features much Jamaican Patois which offers rich potential for the comedic, particularly in the hands of a show-stoppingly-good Cecilia Noble as Aunt Maggie whose every line and movement is a gift. There’s also excellent work from the battling siblings – Oliver Alvin-Wilson’s tensed-up Robert, Michelle Greenidge’s wonderfully gregarious Trudy and a heart-wrenching Franc Ashman as Lorraine, the daughter who gave up her job to care for her ailing mother, who can’t quite hide her hurt at not being appreciated enough."
774,774,Ought To Be Clowns,05/07/2011,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Actors Church Covent Garden,"Last July’s Romeo and Juliet at the Actors Church in Covent Garden was a real unexpected surprise in a summer that was full of productions of that play, site-specific theatre that genuinely worked with the idiosyncrasies of the venue and able to exploit them to their full advantage. This year Iris Theatre are putting on A Midsummer Night’s Dream as their main production for the summer, an early showing of which I caught this week, to see whether the magic could be recaptured with this, my most favourite of Shakespeare’s plays. The venue is St Pauls Church, right in the middle of Covent Garden with its own secluded courtyard filled with trees and shrubbery, which lends itself well to the evocation of the Forest of Arden: Dan Winder’s fluid production places a strong connection with nature front and centre so that the fairies are closer to woodland sprites than the ballet-dressed moppets of old, fitting in perfectly to the grassy knolls, wildflower-strewn groves and secluded bowers, the steps of the church creating a more stately locations where needed. The audience follows the action around the grounds, though there’s only perhaps 2 moves in each half and there’s sufficient room for everyone at each place, sitting or standing – something which is not always the case in promenade productions. Few people would pick this play as their favourite, at least that’s how it seems, but as the first Shakespeare I ever read and one of the first I saw performed, it holds a most affectionate place in my heart and I continue to genuinely love its mix of lovers, mechanicals and fairies. I was most impressed with an interpretative conceit which although leaving me puzzled at the very beginning, put a completely different spin on things at the end: it may be something that more experienced eyes have seen before, but I loved the way they flipped it, giving some interesting takes on this most familiar text: Puck’s final coda is giving extra meaning, Oberon’s “I know a bank where the wild thyme grows…” becomes a teasing bribe, there’s something of a freshness that sits alongside the traditional here in an easy blend. Performances are strong across the board, but David Baynes’ Puck is a hyperactive, manic giggling presence that ought not to work but is wickedly endearing, especially when with Peter Manchester’s paternal Oberon, and Baynes’ works extremely hard, doubling up as a powerful Theseus too. Laura Wickham is a class above with her natural, witty, self-possessed Hermia, Lois Baldry as Helena is saddled with the dual baggage of one of the worst dresses in the history of mankind and my residual memories of Rachael Stirling at the Rose in one of the best acting performances I have ever seen in my life. But altogether the lovers combined to great effect with some brilliantly convincing slaps and ridiculous fight scenes between Ben Crystal and Andrew Mullan as Demetrius and Lysander, both excellent at shifting from the slightly stuffy suitors of the beginning to lovers of reckless abandon once dosed up by Puck. Not everything works: just small things like Oberon’s post-interval song is too long and seemingly without purpose, some of the fairies’ movement is just plain odd and Titania and Oberon’s reunification dance feels misjudged. Eschewing the traditional doubling of the Athenian and fairy nobility exposes how small a part Titania actually is and so it was a shame we saw so little of Diana Kashlan who promised much. And, something I didn’t remember from last year, there are too many moments where the actors are competing with the amplified turns going on in Covent Garden itself, the sound threatening to overpower the acting and coming close to wrecking the mood."
775,775,Ought To Be Clowns,21/01/2016,mag9l,, Print Room,"In the characterful, if chilly, auditorium of former cinema The Coronet, actor Jamie Glover has returned to the world of directing with this little-seen debut play from Peter Shaffer (he of Equus and Amadeus). Set in the 1950s, Five Finger Exercise follows the Harrington family as they retire to their Suffolk country cottage to try and ease their dysfunctional ways but the employment of a young German tutor shatters what uneasy peace existed as his interactions with each cause mayhem and meltdown. In some ways it is quintessentially English, hints of Coward-like playfulness and Rattiganesque repression but as a programme note points out, Shaffer’s time in the US as a young man is just as much in evidence with the ferocity of the emotion that spills out here. Strapping and handsome Walter thinks he found the ideal family unit in which to seek refuge from his Nazi officer father but one by one, he releases something in each Harrington that simply won’t go back. Lucy Cohu’s gorgeous and aspirational Louise finds little happiness in her marriage to Jason Merrells’ Stanley, a deliberately uncultured man but even if she considers herself above his furniture-making business, she’s certainly not above spending its profits. Instead, she turns her attentions full-throttle onto their son Clive, stunting his emotional growth, and in turn Walter himself, where her flirtations arouse somewhat different feelings. Tom Morley’s gangly Clive further typifies this emotional confusion by being a nervous wreck. His family think that going to university has unsettled him but Glover and Morley suggest his deep desolation lies in his closeted homosexuality – the scene where he pyschs himself up to make Walter a proposal, taking the German’s pretty blond head into his hands, is terribly affecting, not least for its abortive ending. It’s a strong performance indeed from Morley. Merrells finds a real pathos in gruff depths of the taciturn Stanley, so very lonely in a family he can’t understand and who won’t make the effort with him, and Terenia Edwards’ Pamela is sparky enough as the teenage daughter on the cusp of maturity. Playing against all of them, and being different things to them all too, is a big ask for Walter and Lorne MacFadyen makes a decent fist of it, an intriguing figure throughout but one buffeted by the crosswinds of their ire."
776,776,Ought To Be Clowns,28/11/2018,Ian,Summer and Smoke, Duke of York’s,"The Almeida’s Summer and Smoke was a huge hit in the spring so it was little surprise to hear a West End transfer was on the cards (especially compared to, say, The Twilight Zone…). And it has transplanted to the Duke of York’s in fine shape, Tom Scutt’s set losing none of its invitingly curved intimacy as it replicates the bare bricks of the N1 venue. And Rebecca Frecknall’s production has lost none of its charge, mainly through retaining the electric chemistry between its leads – an exceptional Patsy Ferran as Alma and Matthew Needham as John. The complex emotional connection between their characters is the heart of the play and the stark simplicity of the staging reflects that from the outset. From its arresting, breathless opening image, Summer and Smoke is all about the way love can just overwhelm, take over every waking moment even against common sense. And the balance shifts between lust and love, desire and duty, societal pressures and sexual awakening, you eventually remember this is a Tennessee Williams play and self-destruction is just around the corner. "
777,777,Ought To Be Clowns,02/07/2014,mag9l,The Art of Dying, Royal Court,"Nick Payne’s monologue The Art of Dying speaks so eloquently about the death of loved ones and all of little details around it that it would surely be impossible not to be moved by its quiet but fierce emotion. He entwines a hugely moving central narrative about the passing of his father with other stories of people passing and the different ways in which they approach death and those left behind deal with it. Some of it is true, some of it is fictional, but it really doesn’t matter which is which in the end as it is all felt so keenly in Michael Longhurst’s acutely observed production. Payne delivers the piece from a chair on a bare stage, the only detail a line of pharmaceutical containers high on a shelf and backlit so that it could almost be the silhouette of a cityscape. And though he has risen to fame as a playwright, he makes a genuinely engaging stage presence. Slightly bashful – the glass of water feels almost as much a crutch as liquid refreshment – but also quietly confident, he guides us through the emotional turbulence, offering a metaphorical steadying hand for that moment when the tears start to prickle (even for himself)."
778,778,Ought To Be Clowns,13/10/2012,Ian,Oh, the Humanity and Other Good Intentions,"Fresh from Edinburgh where it was part of Northern Stage’s programme, Will Eno’s collection of short plays, Oh, the Humanity and Other Good Intentions, made the transfer to the Soho Theatre to make this a good month for fans of this New York-based playwright. The five pieces are separate but interlinked, insomuch as they complement and reinforce each other with a loose thematic continuity. From the sports coach trying to rationalise a poor season to a man and a woman recording their intros for an online dating service, from an airline spokesperson struggling to deliver a press conference after a plane crash to a photographer and his assistant prepping for a shoot, Eno probes the different ways in which people present themselves, put brave faces on, even in the knowledge of the desperation of their various situations. Eno’s powerfully evocative use of language brings a poetic charge to much of these, but also demonstrates the different ways in which we use words, as foreplay, as a protective buffer, as a smokescreen, as a way to search for meaning when the point of it all eludes us. The peeling back of the best, and the worst, of the would-be daters reveals lives barely lived; the erudite sports coach unexpectedly holds a mirror, or is it a shield, up to the voracious journalists waiting to tear him to shreds. The fourth piece, The Bully Composition, really sparkles. Coming the closest to breaking down the audience barrier in a similar way to Thom Pain (based on nothing) – which is just finishing a run at the Print House – as we become the subject of a photograph about to be taken, it gently but insistently draws us in and pulls us together to consider, well, just to consider. Lucy Ellinson – excellent throughout – really grabs the heart here though, with her searching questioning and compassionate urgings to feel."
779,779,Ought To Be Clowns,04/06/2018,Ian,Leave Taking, Bush Theatre,"It’s the little details. A quiet mention by two sisters of the four grandparents that they never met, all remaining in Jamaica as their mother emigrated to England in search of a better life for the family she was destined to have. It’s an aching sadness that permeates Winsome Pinnock’s 1987 intimate and insightful play Leave Taking and one which I’d never really considered before (my grandpa lived next door and my nan and grandad were only ever a couple hours drive away). Consider my eyes opened. Life in Deptford has proven far from a dream for Enid, working her fingers to the bone in two jobs to provide for her daughters Del and Viv, themselves struggling with an identity caught between Caribbean roots and their mother’s new-found Englishness. To help soothe their souls, they visit a local Obeah woman, a spiritual healer, though no-one is prepared for the depth of feeling and the uncomfortable nature of the truths that need to be unleashed.     Madani Younis’ production for his Bush Theatre is nigh-on perfect. Stripped back to the barest of detail in Rosanna Vize’s sparsely evocative set, the scene is set for a scorching examination of what is meant by home, and by identity, how these changes between generations but also within ourselves, over time, as the harshness of reality strips any illusions away. Sarah Niles delivers a performance of exceptional depth as Enid, simply spectacular as she details all that has made her soul so weary, more than just the physical exertion of overwork.  And she’s matched by fearless work from Nicholle Cherrie’s studious Viv and Seraphina Beh’s wilder Del, each acting out differently in the name of finding their ‘selves’ but also in finding a way to connect with each other that satisfies those ideals. The weight of not wanting to disappoint those who love us is a heavy load here and one it isn’t entirely clear whether these women can cast off. Adjoa Andoh’s healer is another stand-out performer, not free of her own issues even while she helps others. And Wil Johnson’s Uncle Brod is a vividly comic ray of rum-soaked sunshine that hints at how daily life is made bearable.  At a moment when the ripples of the Windrush scandal are still so keenly felt (if not by this administration…), one has to be grateful for productions such as this and the National’s recent Nine Night. Shining a light not just on aspects of Jamaican culture one might not have been aware of, but also offering just a smidgen of the Black British experience and what it means to equate two cultures within oneself, even before you have to deal with all the shit the outside world is waiting to throw at you."
780,780,Ought To Be Clowns,24/08/2014,Ian,Edges, Tabard,"I approached Pasek and Paul’s song cycle Edges with something of a little trepidation. Swimming against the critical tide somewhat, I was disappointed by their Dogfight and the Union’s production of See Rock City… reiterated the difficulties in nailing the song cycle format but regardless, I made the trip to Turnham Green to the Tabard, a theatre I don’t visit often enough for the UK professional premiere of Edges. And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, finding it the most satisfying out of the shows mentioned above. Adam Philpott’s production is simple – four twenty-somethings head out to the beach for the afternoon and just sing about life and love and Facebook and friends, trying to figure out some of the trials of young adulthood and the difficulties in finding your own place in a world that won’t stop to let you catch your breath. As a song cycle, it doesn’t have a strong narrative thread running through it, so it is testament to the skills of the company of four that we can trace something of an emotional journey through the leaps and bounds that the score sometimes asks us to make (Philpott’s initial set-up is perhaps a little disingenuous here). But from bitter kiss-offs to exes through heartbreak, soul ache and frat-boy humour, plus an ode to social media which may have dated but still remains true, there’s much to enjoy."
781,781,Ought To Be Clowns,08/05/2012,Ian,The Tempest, Shakespeare on 3,"And so to The Tempest, the third and final radio adaptation (by Jeremy Mortimer here) in the Shakespeare on 3 season, though oddly not cross-cast with the other two so its place in the programme felt a little incongruous. And whether I’d had my fill of Shakespeare on radio or whether its my fatigue with this particular play or whether it just generally wasn’t that distinctive, I found this a bit of a slog."

783,783,Ought To Be Clowns,07/04/2016,mag9l,The Taming of the Shrew, Above the Arts,"At the heart of Custom/Practice’s Verve festival – exploring shifting relations between minority groups and the theatre – is this gender-flipped production of The Taming of the Shrew. Indubitably one of the more challenging of Shakespeare’s plays, contemporary companies thus have to work a little harder to make it ‘work’ for them – Propeller played up the Christopher Sly framing device to confront notions of masculinity and power to great effect but here, director Rae Mcken excises it to plunge us straight into a world where women are ruling the roost. For pretty much every character save Grumio is being played by someone of the opposite sex as someone of the opposite sex but further blurring the boundaries, costumes suggest the original gender. So Martina Laird’s Petruchio arrives looking for a husband by striding onto the stage somewhere between matador and pirate in resplendent gold satin and Tim Bowie’s Bianca bristles under his mother’s edicts whilst wearing make-up, heels and a corset over his tapered joggers. It’s an inventive and challenging take that forces constant questioning about gender roles and society’s role in enforcing them. Crucially though, it’s also entertaining, highly so at times. Laird swaggers magnificently as a Caribbean-accented Petruchio, within minutes of meeting Kazeem Tosin Amore’s Katherina she’s riding him like a horse and taking a bite of his posterior, yet always displaying a finely nuanced mastery of the verse as the tempestuous relationship she instigates with the lover she seizes eventually mellows her, even if just a little. Amore’s Kate makes a good case for changing, full of an emerging upright dignity throughout the play, though he could possibly be a little wilder earlier on.  There’s huge amounts of fun with the company clearly relishing the opportunities afforded here. Brigid Lohrey’s physical work as Gremio and Eugenia Caruso’s brilliantly accented Hortensio are both comic masterclasses and Kayla Meikle and Tracy Green both stand out with their assured handling of the language, dovetailing it perfectly with their contemporary inflections to make it sound fresh as a daisy. Mcken keeps a lightness of touch that lets many a comic touch flourish, such as the many variations on air kissing, and Anna Driftmeier’s louche lounge design marks one of the more effective transfigurations of space in this studio."
784,784,Ought To Be Clowns,29/03/2010,Ian,The Comedy of Errors, RSC via Digital Theatre,"Digital Theatre specialises in providing recordings of plays, captured as-live and available to watch either online or to download onto your computer. They have established links with some top theatre companies and so is building up an interesting collection of plays for viewing. I became aware of Digital Theatre back at Christmastime, and downloaded my first play (Far From The Madding Crowd). It has however remained on my hard-drive unwatched for a number of reasons. But with the offer to get a free download of the RSC’s The Comedy of Errors through the Times newspaper, I decided to revisit the site and actually get round to watching something. There’s been a lot of debate about the merits of videoed theatre over live theatre: my personal view is that there’s ample room for both in the world. The recordings are there to supplement the live experience, not replace it, something that seems to be lost on much of the commenters in the press. These kind of initiatives, along with the National Theatre’s cinema showings of some plays, offer a great opportunity to expand the audience for these shows, and whilst the frisson of live performance may be lost, I can guarantee that whoever saw Phèdre at the cinema would have had a much better view of the faces of the actors than I did from the circle of the Lyttleton. This Comedy of Errors, presented by Told By An Idiot and the RSC last year, was part of a project to get young people into Shakespeare and toured around a number of schools and community centres, as well as a run in Stratford itself (this particular performance was captured at Clapham Community Centre). It is one of the Bard’s sunnier works, featuring two sets of identical brothers separated at birth into matching pairs, one of each. When chance shipwrecks one set into the land where the other resides, the scene is then set for a whirl of comic misunderstandings and mistaken identities. It’s all huge amounts of fun. Shakespeare’s text has been stripped down to its basics, leaving much room for modern references, singing, spoon-playing, music, even a spot of tapdancing to enliven proceedings and keep an incredible level of exuberant energy throughout the 80 minutes. There’s much physical comedy to keep the kids happy, and textual references to other plays that will raise a chuckle from the parents (Dromio, Dromio, wherefore art thou Dromio…), and it was hard to keep the smile from my face for almost the entire show. One of its strengths is that it has a very strong cast, drawn from the RSC company and the quality shows throughout. Everyone is good, I particularly enjoyed Christine Entwisle’s Adriana, Richard Katz’s Antipholus and Dyfan Dwfor and Jonjo O’Neill’s appealing Dromios, but as everyone pitches in whether onstage or off, playing instruments or interactive props, (the water-spraying rock was rather amusing), the enthusiasm is hard to resist. Even when the fun occasionally threatened to overwhelm the storytelling, the cast were able to pull the audience back into the narrative without losing that all-important sense of mischievousness. It does seem an odd choice for inclusion in the Digital Theatre catalogue as it is such an imaginative and physical piece of theatre which constantly interacts with its audience. This is such an integral part of the performance, and one which would vary from night to night, so to choose something so variable to record seems a little perverse. The answer may possibly lie in the fact that this production is being given another short run in Stratford this summer, and so should people be so desirous, they can book their tickets right now. In any case, I really enjoyed watching this, perfect on a rainy afternoon in my flat and all the better for being free! I’m a fan of the concept of Digital Theatre in general, though I do doubt its wider appeal, considering that you are limited to watching things on your computer via their specific player."
785,785,Ought To Be Clowns,22/04/2016,mag9l,Waitress, Brooks Atkinson Theatre,"Hailed as the first Broadway musical with an all-female top-line creative team – music and lyrics by Sara Bareilles, book by Jessie Nelson, choreography by Lorin Latarro, and direction by Diane Paulus – Waitress marks something of a watershed moment. And even if it based on a film, that film was also written by a woman, the late Adrienne Shelly. One might wish for a slightly more substantial slice of something to take that credit but it’s still a rather lovely thing, not least for the slices of pie available to buy in the Brooks Atkinson Theatre. Its saving grace is a superb leading performance from Jessie Mueller as Jenna, a waitress at Joe’s Pie Diner somewhere in the South in a town off of Highway 27. Married and pregnant, and not particularly happy about either, her dreams of opening her own pie shop (she bakes all 27 varieties on offer herself) seem increasingly far away. Until that is, a baking contest in a nearby county opens a window of opportunity, as does an affair with her unexpectedly handsome gynaecologist. There’s something a little disquieting about Jenna’s tale, staying with such an unapologetically brutish husband seems inexplicable and the ethical implications of shagging her doctor are swept under the carpet, but Mueller imbues her with real flour-dusted charm, her gorgeous voice perfectly suited to Bareilles’ introspective songs with the climactic ‘She Used To Be Mine’ proving simply stellar. But the characters around her are too often reduced to caricatures, their performances elevating the material where possible but not always getting the full rise.   "
786,786,Ought To Be Clowns,12/02/2011,Ian,Bender / Laundry, Wet Rep Season – Waterloo East,"The Wet Rep Season at the Waterloo East theatre, tucked under a railway arch near Waterloo station, features 4 plays by 3 writers being performed by 1 company. The shows are delivered in varied double bills so you can really pick which ones you want to see, or even go for the whole set and soak up a whole lot of new writing. Inspired by a Facebook page that asked its members to share their own stories and anecdotes about their nights to remember, Bender tells the story of a night out for three young people whose idea of a good night out is to get totally wasted on drink and drugs and hurl themselves into oblivion. It is a high-octane ride through getting ready to go out, pubs, clubs, post-club adventures and then the comedown which never really relents from the moment its 70 minutes start. Writer Anna Jordan has constructed a highly amusing trail through the empties and the things that happen that we’d rather forget about, which never feels less than authentic (how could it not, given the source material) and it only really falls down with a late twist into melodrama which isn’t really needed. Matthew Gammie is the ringleader (of sorts) constantly addressing the audience in a most engaging way (I learned something very new about Joop!) and his Billie is the most fully realised character, his brimming swagger and self-confidence not totally able to quite mask the quiet desperation of his everyday life and the responsibilities he knows are his. Chris Urch’s puppyish Fibs and Natasha Campbell’s sexually free Lizzy were also both strong in their portrayals, careful to lend some depth to the characters as well as playing the mad-for-it shenanigans for all they are worth. Laundry is a much shorter affair. A one-woman show by Jo Stokes that features Lucy Roslyn as a young American woman, Kate, who can’t leave her apartment. It is wickedly funny and Roslyn plays the eccentricities of a recently single, neurotic, white female perfectly with impeccable comic timing, drawing the audience into her claustrophobic world. For as the confessional style delves deeper into Kate’s personal history, there’s a suffocating intensity that builds up with each revelation accompanied by an extraordinary display of phobic behaviour that is almost too distressing to watch."

788,788,Ought To Be Clowns,03/07/2010,Ian,Assassins, Union Theatre,"Assassins is the latest revival paying tribute to composer Stephen Sondheim in his 80th year, in a steady flow of productions which looks set to continue throughout the year with Into the Woods and Passion at the Open Air Theatre and the Donmar respectively. Playing in Southwark’s Union Theatre, this play looks at 9 people, all connected by their attempts to kill a President of the United States of America, some successful, some unsuccessful, as they re-enact their crimes in a timeless smoky limbo where they can interact with each other and we see their own twisted take on the American dream as they look for meaning in what they tried to do.  I was surprised to find that I just didn’t get it. Indeed I found it quite hard work: musically I did not find it particularly tuneful (only ‘Unworthy Of Your Love’ has a melody that you could remember 15 minutes after the show had ended) and consequently rather uninvolving. And in its subject matter and structure, it assumes quite an intimate knowledge of American political history, with its array of mostly (to me at least)unfamiliar  characters, all out of their historical context to make things even easier. For me, there was a disconnect from the outset reading through the bios of each of the characters in the programme: there were presidents named there who I knew nothing of, not least when they were in power. So in terms of this being a closer look at the characters and motivations of the people who had for whatever reason, decided their only course of action was to kill the president, it provided little real illumination. The realities of their situations, the strength of their political convictons, the various mental and emotional traumas that have driven them to this breaking point are skated over too briefly in favour of caricature and the surreal interactions with their ‘compatriots’. There’s no doubting how well performed it is: Glyn Kerslake as the almost ring-leader of the group John Wilkes Booth is smoothly persuasive and Nick Holder’s Santa suited Samuel Bick is probably the strongest, most haunting acting performance on the stage. Leigh McDonald was a delightfully wild-eyed Sara Jane Moore and John Barr’s Charles Guiteau is manically engaging (although I could have done without him singing right in my face at one point, spittle and all). I had mixed feelings about the staging by Michael Strassen (also the director): too much happening on the sides of the theatre rather than upfront, but the lighting was hazily effective and the six person band was brilliant, interesting orchestrations that dealt well with the wildly varying musical styles covering many of the influences on popular American music. I did like the nice touch of having the Secret Service personnel prowling the street outside the theatre before the show started. Perhaps Assassins is a piece of theatre that needs to be thought about more and improves on repeated viewing, I’m not aware of anyone I know thinking that this isn’t a superb musical so I was more than a little bemused by my reaction to it. Maybe it was because JFK’s assassination has no personal resonance for me, maybe it was because I couldn’t quite shake my misgivings about its rather cavalier attitude to the portrayal of mental illness, maybe it’s just too American: whatever it was, it just wasn’t for me today. Hooray.  The Emperor's Clothes are exposed … tuneless and tedious, this production is strictly for diehard Sondheimistas who would worship the octogenarian's toenail clippings.   Time to reflect on his magnificent career which divides into two parts – the tuneful, witty and clever work he produced on his Hammerstein-influenced 'good days' including WS Story, Gypsy, Follies, Company, Woods, Todd, Night Music versus the dark and incomprehensible 'other' side to his prolific schizophrenia: Passion, Pacific O, Merrily and particularly Assassins when you wonder if he was actually smoking crack. Well I loved it, just loved it. I've been singing the tunes (badly, I think they're quite hard) since I saw it at the Donmar 18 years ago. Yes, it's flawed, yes it's difficult to follow, yes it's it sags in places – but this is real, live, grown-up theatre – and at £15 a ticket! Wow. Memorable tunes ? Yes there are !Well I can't get ""Everybody's Got The Right to Be Happy"" out of my head – a week after seeing the show.l could happily sit through the full two hours again…and again. Two hours – no enterval – and I was spellbound.I agree that it mentioned Presidents (and assassins) I was not aware of. But shouldn't theatre be informative ?Every character was interesting (and brilliantly portrayed).Love to see a larger production. I don't disagree that theatre should be informative. But in its format, with all the characters crossing timelines and whatnot, it didn't really inform me enough about them. But then it is never going to be a historical play, so maybe it bears repeat viewing, to get over the initial confusion.Likewise with the music, it was the first time I had heard many of the songs and I cannot lie, I did not hear many tunes there, but give me the soundtrack on my iPod and I'm sure they'll eventually burrow their way into my subconscious. I wonder how many of the people who love it, can honestly say they loved it after the first time they saw it."
789,789,Ought To Be Clowns,02/09/2011,Ian,The Mercy Seat, Pleasance," As the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks looms, London theatres are looking to mark the occasion in their own ways: Headlong’s unique immersive approach has brought together 19 writers to create something new, the King’s Head are reviving the opera Manifest Destiny that questions US culpability in the attack and the Pleasance has this revival of Neil LaBute’s 2002 play The Mercy Seat, one of the first theatrical responses which predictably attracted much controversy in its original run. The timing of brand new company Glow Box Production’s revival would seem to be a natural fit, but the truth is that the events of the 11th September only form a backdrop to LaBute’s play, they act as a trigger to the human drama that plays out but it is far from the central thrust of the work, something which a little distance from the actual event clearly helps with. Instead the focus is on the relationship between Ben and Abby and the choices they make in the face of the opportunity presented to them in the face of tragedy as they escape death by having taken the morning off for a sneaky liaison at her apartment. They’ve been having an affair for the past three years and see in the chaos of a city in turmoil, a chance to sneak off and start a life together but there’s more than a few issues that stand in the way. As one would expect from LaBute, this illicit relationship is a far from easy one: Abby is older than him and Ben’s boss, he is married with children, and as they battle back and forth about how much they really mean to each other, examine exactly what it is that each of them is having to sacrifice in order to go through with eloping and the morality of their actions at a time when their colleagues have been killed. Playing in real time, Janine Ingrid Ulfane and Sean O’Neil sketched out the twisted dynamics of this couple with great relish: the physicality of their relationship palpable though not necessarily quite enough to bridge the intellectual gap between them: LaBute has lots of fun peppering Abby’s chat with references that Ben just doesn’t get, this humour providing some much-needed relief. For The Mercy Seat is not a particularly easy watch, its protagonists are not especially likeable and their actions are all about the selfishness of the pursuit of individual desire at a time when an unprecedented sense of community was prevailing. But this is what LaBute excels at, caustic tense tales of the darker side of human nature, the grabby opportunism of seizing what one wants without thinking too much about others, the desperation of needing to be the first to be told that we are loved and the compromises we’re willing to make in order to hear it, of needing the sense of victory over the other woman. The way in which the dialogue flows feels very naturalistic, there are no dramatic arcs but rather the real-time aspects allows for the cranking up of an already tense atmosphere to breaking point as the time for planning the escape finishes and all that is left is that final step of commitment."
790,790,Ought To Be Clowns,16/10/2011,Ian,Bunny – Soho Theatre,,"Jack Thorne’s Bunny first played at the 2010 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and was exceptionally well received, winning a Fringe First award. This 60 minute monologue has now taken up residence in the intimate space upstairs at the Soho Theatre, nabokov’s production reuniting cast and creatives on this excoriating tale of a day in the life of an eighteen year old girl, Katie, caught on the emotional rollercoaster of young adulthood. Rosie Wyatt’s Katie is mess of contradictions: a sixth-form good student, clarinet player in the school orchestra and solidly middle class with her Guardian-reading parents but frequently acts out with them as riven with gnawing self-doubt and identity issues. She doesn’t have too many real friends in her life, she’s well known at school for giving anyone a blowjob and she’s currently seeing an older guy Abe, and it is when he gets involved in a street fight that Bunny really kicks off. Sucked into a trail of violent revenge and sexual menace, we follow headstrong Katie as she struggles to keep her head afloat and make the important decisions that could impact the rest of her life. Wyatt is simply incredible: beautifully capturing the gawky humour of a teenager at sorts with her environment, constantly testing the boundaries of what’s acceptable and intelligent enough to know she’s doing it. As the tension is ratcheted up, she is unwavering in the intensity of her performance, sustaining direct eye contact with seemingly everyone and breaking our hearts as it becomes increasingly clear how fragile the tough outer shell she portrays truly is. Her repeated refrain of ‘I know what I’m doing’ becomes ever more heartbreaking and all the more so given the ambiguity with which the piece ends – no easy resolutions here."
791,791,Ought To Be Clowns,30/12/2017,Ian,Jade Dragon,,"Just a quickie for this web series which I’ve been meaning to get around to for ages now. Written by Rebecca Boey (with Daniel York contributing one of the nineteen short episodes), Jade Dragon is a mockumentary series set in a Chinese takeaway which does a couple of crucial things. One, it represents a much-needed, and still all-too-rare, opportunity for actors of East Asian heritage to work in a British media that feels stubbornly resistant to crossing this particular Rubicon of diversity. But it also offers up a non-judgemental, matter-of-fact presentation of what that British East Asian experience looks like in all its varied racism from overt violence to subtle othering. The tone of Boey’s writing is lightly comic, with definite melancholic undertones, as none of the realities of working in a barely-scraping-by takeaway are shirked, especially when a swanky new Chinese restaurant opens up down the way. But with each episode being so compact, there’s a real concentration of all the frustration of dealing with other people’s preconceptions and stereotyping and straight-up offensiveness."
792,792,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2013,Ian,Light Shining in Buckinghamshire / The Colour of Milk, Radio 3/4,"For reasons not entirely clear, Mark Ravenhill is curating a season of three classic plays that he likes for Radio 3, the first of which was Carol Churchill’s Light Shining in Buckinghamshire. It’s an interesting choice as it is a fairly challenging piece of historical drama and as I observed when I saw Polly Findlay’s production for the Arcola back in 2010, it is a highly theatrical one as the company of actors rattle through a large number of short scenes and an equally considerable cast of characters. Consequently, I don’t think it suited the medium of radio as the differentiation between them all didn’t really come across. And being such a cerebral play, focusing on the tumultuous period in English history during the Civil War when huge social and political change was in the offing and tracing its impact on all levels of society, it needs a deal of clarity for it to be most effective and for me, the announcement of scene titles wasn’t enough. Which was a shame as the cast that Ravenhill gathered for this was brilliant – Amanda Drew and Monica Dolan, Justin Salinger and Paul Rhys, the kind of company I would pay extremely good money to see. You can’t win them all. Much more successful for me was Nell Leyson’s adaptation of her own novel The Colour of Milk for Radio 4. Set in the 1830s, it’s a rather harrowing tale narrated by Mary, a fifteen-year-old girl who has a limited window of opportunity to tell us her story. Her life is one of rural toil on the family farm until one day she is summoned to the local vicar’s house to help with the rapidly declining health of his invalid wife. A world of new opportunities is thus opened to her but the consequences of these changes ripple out with devastating effect."
793,793,Ought To Be Clowns,21/02/2012,Ian,Artist Descending A Staircase, Criterion,"Home to the long-running The 39 Steps (which I still haven’t quite gotten round to seeing yet), the Criterion Theatre has been expanding its programming both with late-evening and afternoon events. This Tuesday afternoon saw a performance of Tom Stoppard’s radio play Artist Descending A Staircase by such an attractive cast that it was impossible to resist. The play was performed in front of us to a microphone, although I couldn’t quite figure out whether this was being recorded for real or not, and sound effects created onstage so it was just like watching a radio play being recorded rather than something being acted out and was most amusing with it – not least because we got to see the actors in their civvies and see what their fashion sense is like! But to the play itself: we open with a scratchy recording of undetermined sounds and soon find ourselves in an attic studio shared by three elderly avant-garde artists with two of them standing over the body of the third at the bottom of the staircase. Beauchamp is the one who made the recording as his art centres on the sounds of everyday life and as he and his colleague Martello hear their dead friend Donner acknowledge the presence of something just before his fall, they each point the finger of suspicion at the other. In a series of flashbacks both to the recent cantankerous past and way back in their history to the birth of their shared artistic ideal, we see how their relationship has progressed and developed, especially with the arrival of Sophie, a blind woman who caught the affections of all three of them in different ways. Stoppard looks at how our own senses can work against us as well as the fallibility of our own memories which can have huge repercussions for both love and life. As the older trio, Oliver Cotton, James Fleet and Tim McInnerny had most of the best lines and had great fun with them too as they bitched about the bad habits of the others, groused about their artistic choices and generally grumbled their way through life. Their younger counterparts Henry Lloyd Hughes, James Northcote and Ed Bennett respectively had a slightly more difficult task in convincing us of their earnestness but all did well and were significantly helped in the most unlikely of ways, by Stoppard actually writing with genuine heartfelt emotion for his characters for once and Northcote in particular seizes on this to create a most moving portrayal."
794,794,Ought To Be Clowns,13/12/2010,Ian,Kin, Royal Court,"Set in an all-girls boarding school in the 1990s, EV Crowe’s Kin is the last show of 2010 to show upstairs at the Royal Court. Crowe’s writing was also featured in Clean Break’s Charged at the Soho Theatre with the short play Doris Day about the challenges for modern policewomen but this show looks at what could happen when young girls are cooped together in the claustrophobic atmosphere of boarding school, away from familial guidance. It focuses on two girls Mimi and Janey who have a complex friendship which is further complicated by another girl Nina accusing Janey of bullying. And so rivalries, burgeoning sexualities, precociousness and fraught emotions bubble up. The narrative is non-linear here though, a complicating factor which adds nothing and actually detracts from things as it all adds up to very little, fragments of scenes threatening to come to chilling life but hardly any actually achieving that and given the short running time combined with this structure, I didn’t feel like Crowe’s writing actually said anything and left me unmoved and completely indifferent to what I had just seen. There are moments that stand out, the loneliness of this enforced separation from families, the inadequacies of the phone call home (in a pre-mobile age), the cruelties that can be wrought on contemporaries at any age. But for all of these, there’s a clunker to go along with it, the school play being a production of The Crucible is beyond heavy-handed and a depressing realisation that the writing isn’t strong to cope without such direct allusions and the reliance on so much profanity coming from these young girls feels artificially maintained, designed to shock rather than dramatically necessary. It was well-acted for the most part by the young company, the three young girl roles are alternated but I couldn’t see any mention of who was playing on this particular night. Annette Badland’s housemistress stood out amongst the older performers but working with so little, one is ultimately left disappointed and unfulfilled. With prices going up to £20 for the upstairs shows at the Royal Court and a series of mostly underwhelming shows up here this year, it does feel like I could be venturing here a little less next year."
795,795,Ought To Be Clowns,24/11/2018,Ian,The Madness of George III, Nottingham Playhouse,"Mark Gatiss has been getting rave reviews for his performance in The Madness of George III at Nottingham Playhouse but for me, there was just a little bit too much of
for my liking. There’s lots to love in Adam Penfold’s production, particularly in key supporting roles like Adrian Scarborough’s Dr Willis and Debra Gillett’s Queen Charlotte, and some of the smaller parts like Nadia Albina’s Fitzroy and Jack Holden’s Greville. And I enjoyed that Penfold cast several of the ostensibly male parts with women, allowing the likes of Louise Jameson and Stephanie Jacob. Throw in a lusciously opulent design from Robert Jones and strikingly dramatic lighting from Richard Howell, and it’s a real theatrical treat, a real statement of intent from this nicely ambitious artistic director.  If you’re going to pick holes, as I inevitably find myself doing, it’s that the play’s portrayal of mental health issues – and society’s reaction to them –  feel a little out of kilter with the contemporary conversation. That’s not unexpected considering Alan Bennett wrote it, nearly 30 years ago at that, but veering towards the Glen of it all raises a question. And the play’s desire for neatness feels just a touch old-fashioned but that’s not to deny how good work is going on here as well.  "
796,796,Ought To Be Clowns,02/03/2011,Ian,Sprint Festival 2011, Camden People’s Theatre,       
797,797,Ought To Be Clowns,29/01/2016,mag9l,BPolar, VAULT Festival,"A fascinating one this, an adaptation of Gogol’s Diary of A Madman by the Israeli “Ayit” Ensemble (made up of actors from and around the Negev and Beer Sheva) which is performed wordlessly, employing instead a range of movement techniques, live video art and projections, a pulsing contemporary soundtrack and theatrical trickery to produce a dizzying non-stop hour of theatre. BPolar follows the life of a minor civil servant, from his troubled upbringing with a violent father to a misguided obsession with his manager’s daughter, to a descent into the turmoil of the bipolar disorder that haunts him. And Yoav Michaeli’s production proves a canny way of depicting mental illness by creating an immersive experience that is near-overwhelming in its scope. Ofer Freeman’s clerk sits at the heart of this multi-disciplinary work and gives a powerful performance indeed, buffeted by all that life throws at him but also by the other five members of the ensemble. They cover the roles of everyone else in his life story (including the demons in his head), and manipulate movable platforms and screens, using them to appear and disappear seamlessly in and out of scenes.  Played out mostly behind a gauze screen onto which Eli Levy’s video work is projected, Avi Sechvi’s design allows for maximum flexibility but being a fringe production, it is perhaps a little rough around the edges. The kuroko work – stagehands dressed all in black to denote invisibility – is excellently done but occasionally, their clothes underneath were visible, shattering the illusion, and the sightlines from my seat meant I was often privy to some behind-the-scenes business."
798,798,Ought To Be Clowns,01/03/2014,mag9l,Versailles, Donmar Warehouse,"Expectations for Peter Gill’s Versailles were quite low due to a number of factors – a five star review from Billington; my reaction to Making Noise Quickly, Gill’s last directorial intervention at the Donmar; the announcement of a running time of 3 hours; and decidedly mixed chatter from friends who had already seen it. And as it often the way with these things, I ended up rather enjoying it. It certainly helped that I was prepared for the extreme steadiness of its pacing and the dip of the second act of this self-directed play. Set in the aftermath of the First World War, Gill examines and contrasts the impact of the peace process of Versailles on a Europe ravaged by conflict and also on a slice of middle-class English society, notably Kentish families the Rawlinsons and the Chaters. Leonard Rawlinson is a young civil servant involved in the negotiations for the treaty but he is haunted by both his doubts of whether a lasting peace can be achieved through these means and the ghost of his fallen soldier lover Gerald, who just happened to be the son of the neighbouring Chaters.  The play is at its considerable best when it is dealing with the weighty repressed emotion at its heart, not just in the secretly gay lovers but also in the ramifications of the social upheaval of wartime, leaving so many unsure of their place in a society they barely recognise. There’s also a lot of dry debate, dense amounts of detail packed in that stultifies large swathes of the first two parts where one imagines external directorial intervention might have been beneficial. The sharp humour that frequently comes through also jars a little, playing a little too closely to contemporary attitudes. But the exceptional performance level makes it a hot ticket regardless. Francesca Annis and Barbara Flynn are both excellent as the mothers, Annis particularly affecting here; Gwilym Lee’s Leonard is a perfect combination of passionate concern and restrained involvement, the scenes with Tom Hughes’ Gerald building to something near devastating; and there’s good work from Helen Bradbury and Tamla Kari as the younger women in their lives, Adrian Lukis as a neighbour and Christopher Godwin as Gerald’s distraught father."
799,799,Ought To Be Clowns,14/11/2016,mag9l,School of Rock, New London,"The 2003 Jack Black-starring film School of Rock was a big success, trading off its stock talent show plot device with genuine rock music credentials in a soundtrack full of the likes of AC/DC, Led Zeppelin and The Doors. So it was a little bit of a surprise to find that Andrew Lloyd-Webber decided to adapt it into an original musical – his version of rock is certainly not the same as that espoused by Dewey Finn, School of (Pop-)Rock perhaps. But one sticky moment aside (where a snippet of Stevie Nicks’ Edge of Seventeen sits awkwardly alongside a rock ballad ‘Where Did the Rock Go?’ exposing the contrast between the two kinds of rock), this School of Rock is a cheerily appealing slice of musical theatre. And with a seemingly endless role call of talented youngsters who, as we’re reminded at the beginning and the end of the show, play all their own instruments live, shows off a wealth of emerging British musical theatre talent. The story (book by Julian Fellowes) remains movie-predictable. Good-for-nothing aspiring rock star Dewey Finn adopts his flatmate’s identity to earn a quick buck as a substitute teacher but when he finds a class of budding musicians at his mercy, co-opts them into forming a rock band who can help him win a local Battle of the Bands contest. Along the way he learns life lessons and so do the kids, their worlds expanded through this alternative musical education. David Fynn is nigh-on perfect casting for Dewey, a charismatic cross between Jack Black and the impishness of Robin Williams, and Rosanna Hyland (stepping in for Florence Andrews) is fun as a snooty headteacher who eventually lets her inner rock chick out. But it’s undoubtedly the kids who are the stars of the show with their extraordinary musicality – the best moment of the show comes when they rock out properly at the contest and the actual band (led by musical director Matt Smith) gather on their balcony to watch them play, further proof that the kids really are alright. Laurence Connor’s production thus marshals its resources well, if offering up little by the way of surprise in Anna Louizos’ design or genuine emotional depth, as occasionally hinted at in songs like ‘If Only You Would Listen’ and the rapprochements of the end. But nevetherless, School of Rock entertains exceedingly in its own way"
800,800,Ought To Be Clowns,10/03/2008,Ian,The Hour We Knew Nothing Of Each Other, National Theatre,"In terms of what happens, well a lot passes by on stage but equally nothing actually happens. People walk, run, skip, jump, limp across the stage in various guises, some dressed as recognisable figures, most just regularly clad, and tiny little stories are played out during their journeys from one side of the stage to other. Life, death, tragedy, sex and lots of comedy are on display here and it is fitfully awe-inspiringly good, especially when there’s the stronger narrative arc that engages the attention, like the terrorist attack towards the end. It ends up being a funny mixture of things: it is wordless but there’s loads of sound effects so there’s rarely any true silence; it sets itself up as a people-watching exercise, but there’s no attempt to remove the theatricality from it, one never forgets one is sitting in the Lyttelton and indeed the mind boggles as to what the backstage area must look like and the speed needed for all the changes."
801,801,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Macbeth, Greenwich Theatre,"A glance at the credits suggests that this is Ricky Duke’s Macbeth, as much as Shakespeare. Dukes directs his own adaptation here and has also designed this production for Lazarus Theatre and at its best, it is thrilling in its stylish directorial vision. With its eye on the ensemble, its the physicality of this production that marks it out as a refreshing change to the norm. Played in contemporary dress, this Macbeth finds itself unmoored from any real specific context. Guns and gas masks sit alongside sharp suits for the company but the world of the play is ultimately, suitably strange. Apparitions haunt the stage, watching scenes impassively; coronations burst out of glitter drop falls; war is fought through the scattering of mountains of paperwork.   It’s a bold resetting and one which has its moments. The lining up in single file for coronation may borrow from Kings of War but remains an indelible image each time it is used to the tune of Zadok the Priest, pointing up the endlessly cyclical nature of regime change. Having the Weird Sisters chanting in gas masks proves similarly striking and the hints of sexual repression among this brotherhood lend an especial charge to some key moments.  Phil Matejtschuk’s sound design builds effectively on the ominous atmosphere of the play, aided too by Alex Musgrave’s lighting, rendering some of the more challenging staging decisions more fascinating (Dukes is perhaps a little too keen on some of the more undersung inches of the stage). And a clear, unfussy approach to the text ensures the necessary clarity – Jamie O’Neill’s Macbeth and Lewis Davidson’s Banquo both standing out in this respect."
802,802,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2018,Ian,Girls and Boys, Royal Court,"Credit where credit is due – Es Devlin’s design for Girls and Boys, aided by Luke Halls’ video work, is simply stunning – the simplest of ideas realised with perfect execution. A modern flat smothered in dreamy turquoise, punctuated at each scene change with a flash of the ‘real’ flat superimposed on top. The effect is literally blink-and-miss-it but somehow sears onto the retina, as if caught in a hallucination or reverie. But such deceptive simplicity is far from effortless as no less than four associate set designers are credited – Jack Headford, Jed Skrzypczak, Angie Vasileiou and Machiko Weston – and two associate video designers – Charli Davis and Zakk Hein. No matter how the work was divvied up, all should get to take a bow as it is deeply thrilling work (I want someone to write a longform piece on the subtly changing orange objects). It also helps that Dennis Kelly’s monologue, delivered by Carey Mulligan, is exceptional.  It’s the type of show best experienced sight unseen, as unspoiled as you can be. Mulligan’s unnamed character starts off as a raconteur, delivering the anecdotes of a headily intense relationship with all the wit and ease of a stand-up comedian. From charismatic first meetings to upward career trajectories, they have it made. And in-between, she playacts scenes of domestic boisterousness with their two kids, sibling breaking clay chickens and games with buckets of mud. And then a moment happens that sucks all the air out of theatre. Less a punch in the guts and more a sense of the walls slowly closing in, forced by an unbearable weight. Here, Girls and Boys soars. Mulligan’s tragic intensity is peerless, whether searching for meaning where none is to be found or imbuing a Wikidump of facts with impossibly real feeling. And Kelly’s writing is a fierce indictment of the corrosive effects of violence – of any kind – on society and full of arresting insight. As Mulligan’s character says at one point, “I am, of course, just giving you one side”. but Girls and Boys might just be the best new play of 2018 regardless of what is yet to come. Running time: 80 minutes (without interval)

Thursday night shows at the Stadschouwberg Amsterdam are regularly surtitled in English but I always want to see more. In the case of plays like Blood Wedding and The Maids, I’ve been able to get away with since I know them; with others, like A Bride in the Morning, it’s been more of a challenge.  And so it was with Uit het leven van marionetten (From the life of the marionettes), the fifth Ingmar Bergman adaptation from Toneelgroep Amsterdam, helmed by film director Nanouk Leopold in her stage debut. I’d hoped to watch the film in advance but I couldn’t track it down in time and so went into the Schouwburg in Rotterdam armed with just a flimsy synopsis and an overwhelming admiration for a company that included the rather fab Eelco Smits. So in all honesty, I have to hold my hands up and say a fair amount of what happened passed me by, though the larger picture of how the worst parts of society can inculcate murderous tendencies in people was clear. What I can say is that Leopold’s directorial vision was often stunning, blending her cinematic vision with the power of live theatre in a way that felt very much at home with the Toneelgroep aesthetic whilst still maintaining its own identity."
804,804,Ought To Be Clowns,02/04/2017,mag9l,The Chemsex Monologues, King’s Head,"Patrick Cash’s The HIV Monologues slayed me last year so the opportunity to see another of his plays with Dragonflies Theatre was not one I wanted to pass up. The Chemsex Monologues did great business at the King’s Head last year and with that venue’s current tendency towards extremely LGBT-friendly material, it has made an unsurprising return here. Directed by Luke Davies, Cash’s storytelling winds together the tales of four people engaged – to varying degrees – in London’s chemsex scene.  For the uninitiated – it’s a gay subculture where guys get high and have sex with each other, but as post-club chillout parties have been transformed by harder and harder drugs, it has become a world not without its challenges. And without judgement, without condemnation, The Chemsex Monologues gives a real insight into the ways in which people get drawn in. A sexual health worker feeling lonely, a guy who can’t believe his luck at pulling the fittest guy in the club and unwilling to let the night end, a faithful fag hag, a pretty boy with insecurities – anyone, everyone?  It is a pretty niche world, a subculture within a minority, but Cash still gives us huge variety in the richly defined characters that are created here. Kane Surry’s Narrator frames the play with his initial foray into the world, Charly Flyte’s Fag Hag Cath is an amusing if slightly underwritten diversion into the female perspective, Matthew Hodson’s health worker is wittily sardonic as his better instincts get overridden by curiosity at the show’s heart, Denholm Spurr’s beautiful party boy is perfectly played in all his vulnerability, helplessly addicted to it all."
805,805,Ought To Be Clowns,08/04/2014,mag9l,The Beautiful Game, Union,"Andrew Lloyd Webber and Ben Elton’s The Beautiful Game managed a run of just under a year at the turn of the millennium. It was then rewritten and retitled The Boys in the Photograph for a 2009 North American premiere in Canada, and it is that version which now makes its London fringe debut at the Union Theatre, but under the original title of The Beautiful Game. Got it? The endless tinkering of musicals is nothing new – ‘Our Kind of Love’, the best known song in the original was filleted out and repurposed as the title song for Love Never Dies – but the clumsiness with which the ending has been redone here is ridiculously clunky. Which is a shame, as there is much good work here in Lotte Wakeham’s production. David Shields’ simple design makes clever use of benches and Tim Jackson’s choreography finds a remarkably effective middle ground between soccer and soft shuffle in bringing the football sequences to vibrant life on the limited traverse stage. An appealingly fresh-faced cast, spearheaded by an excellent Niamh Perry, deliver performances of spirited energy and graceful enthusiasm. And musically, MD Benjamin Holder introduces an interesting range of textures to enhance the score and alleviate some of its repetitive longueurs. The problems lie mainly with the material. Elton’s book follows a Belfast football team from 1969-72 as attentions turn from kicking balls to kicking heads in as the nationalist struggle explodes into life, fracturing communities down political and religious lines. It’s a show of two halves though with Elton failing to weave together his subjects or demonstrate much nuance in the exploration of them. The first half is football crazy, the second half terrorist mad, so that much of what happens before the interval just seems like the set-up for the key narrative which finally arrives late in the game and as a result feels overly hurried. And there’s little subtlety in the message either – football good, terrorists bad ad infinitum. Things really are black and white in this world and the dialogue is continually cliché-ridden rather than delving into the psychology of what really radicalises people, what motivates someone to take such extreme action, how people reconcile such divided loyalties. Lloyd Webber’s score is also ill-equipped to dig that deep, shining best in the romantic liaisons and hilarious wedding night of Perry’s Mary Maguire, radiating moral integrity in the murky world of the Troubles and Ben Kerr’s John Kelly, a promising footballer sucked into the darkness."
806,806,Ought To Be Clowns,25/04/2017,Ian,Showstopper, Lyric,"After their residency at the Apollo, the Showstopper team have skipped along to the Lyric where they have been performing their brand of improvised musical on a random selection of Mondays, roughly every three weeks. If you’re new to their work, Showstopper is created anew on the night, suggestions garnered from the audience for the title and the various styles of musical theatre in which the songs will be improvised. And it is always extremely good fun and frequently hilarious, hence my multiple visits over the years."
807,807,Ought To Be Clowns,25/06/2015,mag9l,The Seagull, Open Air Theatre,"Someone wiser than I pointed out that the only way you could do The Seagull at the Open Air Theatre was to be thoroughly iconoclastic, ruffling those Chekhovian feathers into something brasher, bolder and less contained. And there is no doubting that that is what Torben Betts’ new version and Matthew Dunster’s directorial vision have set out to do here, ramping up the comedic elements (of the first half at least) but sacrificing much of the counterbalancing tragedy that customarily gives the Russian writer’s work its depth.  There’s some good work here – Janie Dee’s skittish Arkadina is a delight as she vainly tries to cling onto a long-gone girliishness (though impressive barre work!), Lisa Diveney’s Kirsten Stewart-ish Masha is well-realised in all her agonised inaction, and Jon Bausor’s striking design tilts a giant mirror at 45 degrees to the floor to both open up and expose the world of the tortured souls in this country estate. But the prevailing mood is one of something close to glibness, as the frivolity of the updating comes up hard against the traditional period setting. "
808,808,Ought To Be Clowns,01/03/2018,Ian,Conquest, VAULT Festival,"Welcome to the world’s first revenge cupcake company though if you’re a man whose behaviour has been somewhat wanting, you might want to check the frosting. This eye-opening (but honestly, not so far from the realms of reality) business idea lies at the heart of Katie Caden’s Conquest, which asks questions of how pro-active feminists need to be in contemporary society. At the heart of the show is the relationship between Jo and Alice. They meet by chance in a Boots, where Jo spots Alice crying after a sexual assault has left her in need of a morning-after pill. And as an unlikely friendship blossoms, the ferociously feminist Jo (“she uses the word ‘patriarchy’ in everyday sentences” introduces Alice to the world of Conquest, the company she’s started up with a band of equally wronged women. The entertainment value in Jess Daniels’ production comes from having Colette Eaton and Lucy Walker-Evans inhabit all of these characters, whilst simultaneously playing Jo and Alice respectively. It neatly lightens the tone of the darker aspects of the material but also prove a stirring showcase for the pair in all the comic highs and emotional lows that they get to portray."
809,809,Ought To Be Clowns,28/08/2013,Ian,Sweet Bird of Youth, Old Vic,"There’s much to admire about the Old Vic’s lavish production of Tennessee Williams’ Sweet Bird of Youth, but ultimately I found little to really love as its three hours meander their way through its uneventful beginnings to a far-from-revelatory conclusion. Its big selling point is the return of Kim Cattrall to our stage, playing fading Hollywood star Alexandra Del Lago who is in hiding in a Florida hotel after a disastrous movie premiere which was designed to be a grand comeback. Helping her over her trauma is a handsome gigolo named Chance who fancies himself as an actor but finding himself in his hometown, has to deal with the demons of his past. The play feels scuppered from the start by the lengthy two-hander which dominates the opening. Cattrall is excellent, if a little too luminous to really convince as a past-it star, as Del Lago rails against the movie system that has made her who she is and can yet still spit her out at the merest hint of failure. The problem lies with the character of Chance, Williams’ predilection for martyrish tendencies not backed up with anywhere near enough depth of character to make us care for someone intended to be a tragic hero. Seth Numrich does well in layering in as much nuance as he can but never really convinces as far as the chemistry between the pair goes, a near-fatal mis-step for me and one from which the play never recovered."

811,811,Ought To Be Clowns,26/10/2010,Ian,Blasted, Lyric Hammersmith,"                This is an excellent production of an important play, make no mistake. There's a fascinating interview/feature on it with Simon Stephens in the Guardian which you should read if you haven't done so already. Sierz's website http://www.inyerface-theatre.com is also a great read too.  Booked to see this next week and can't wait. I saw this on Wednesday night, the last of the preview nights and like you, it was my first experience of Kane's work, although I had heard of her and knew about the controversy.  I agree about some of it seeming too deliberately shocking and I'm not sure I think the play is that great, but I thought it was a stunning production. I was obviously luckier than you with the rest of the audience on my night as there was complete silence around me during the set changes which I found completely unnerving. Thanks for the reading tips, someone had told be about the Sierz thing so I'll be sure to check it out."
812,812,Ought To Be Clowns,10/04/2011,Ian,London Road, National Theatre,"London Road, with book and lyrics by Alecky Blythe and music and lyrics by Adam Cork, is a show emerged out of an experimental workshop at the National Theatre, pairing unlikely collaborators to create new pieces of musical theatre. What they focused on was a series of interviews Blythe carried out with the residents of London Road, Ipswich, at the time when police were hunting for a serial killer after five women were found murdered. Why she chose that street was because it was where the murderer lived but her focus was not on him or the victims, but rather the people on the periphery, how the whole thing had affected the other inhabitants and as she revisited them months later, what their response as a community was. The show plays in the Cottesloe and this was a preview performance. Alecky Blythe is an exponent of verbatim theatre, particularly a technique created by Anna Deavere Smith, whereby she interviews her subjects and then creates theatre by reproducing their words and vocal inflections faithfully, right down to the ums and aahs and you knows, in the performance. Working in the musical form has necessitated a slight departure from the pure verbatim form but also allows for the injection of a little dramatic license in adding emphases and repetition to what could be termed the key phrases of the chorus. Adam Cork’s music fits into the same idea of trying to replicate the speech patterns and feelings and remaining as true to the material as possible, rather than composing a musically coherent score per se, he’s created a series of responses to the text. Which all leads me to saying it is nigh on impossible to describe the music and do it justice! It is not a musical in the traditional sense, eschewing conventional songs for musical phrasing. It takes in influences from a wide spectrum including popular music, Christmas tunes and even opera: there’s a strong sense of jazz improvisational work in the loose free-flowing nature of much of it but as a body of work, it generally resists easy definition. What it does provide though as an almost operatic intensity at times, especially in the choral work with stirring harmonies and progressions which sit beautifully with the restrained, almost minimalist feel to much of the score. The end result is therefore something really quite unique, and in my opinion, something rather special. It plays like a low-key documentary at first, the ‘drama’ of the tragic murders is so firmly in the backseat for the most part so that the focus really is on how this community of people has been and continued to be affected by such events happening in their midst, but also the ongoing impact of the media circus which continued until the trial. The issues it focuses on may seem trivial or not particularly charitable, but these are recognisably the concerns of real people: the peculiar fear of knowing there’s a murderer but one targeting prostitutes so many women weren’t necessarily too scared; the indignation felt by the residents as their area is constantly referred to as a red-light district; the nagging desire to know if the murders were carried out in the house on their street or somewhere else. Even the unapologetic attitudes of some, towards the victims, becomes understandable as we begin to get a sense of what it must have been like to have the street where you live be gradually over-run by prostitutes and the men looking for them. There’s a lot of wry humour in here, the interplay between long-married couples, the amusing realisations of the scale of things – offering a cup of tea to a policeman to find there’s hordes of them and worrying about offending by not making them all one, spotting their houses on the news as intrepid reporters film outside on their street. But what is most moving, and this is Blythe’s point, is the sense of community that this adversity engenders amongst these people, as they realise that a crime of this magnitude really has happened in their quiet town and that the only response is to pull together and find succour and healing collectively. Norris has staged London Road end-on with two additional rows of seats either side in the ‘pit’, i.e. onstage. The band are placed in a room that hangs over the back part of the stage, creating a dark, sometimes smoke-filled recess from which actors often emerge, to hauntingly great effect in many cases. And in casting such an experienced company, he has really brought a sense of lived-in-ness to proceedings, all excel at portraying ‘normal’ people and to my inexperienced ear, captured a variety of East Anglian accents well. It really is an ensemble piece but Kate Fleetwood is the closest to a lead character, as the woman who forms the coalescing point for the community and is responsible for setting up the London Road in Bloom competition which transformed the public face of the street, and despite a rather dodgy wig, she is superb. Clare Burt runs her a close second though with her more anguished neighbour and I also enjoyed Nicola Sloane, Nick Holder, Howard Ward…really, it is a joy to watch this entire group. Lest this turn into a rave review, this isn’t a perfect show. It is almost always low-key rather than dramatic, a deliberate choice which sometimes works but there are times when it does become a little too languid, the repetition a little too wearing, the number of ‘you knows’ a little too frustrating no matter how realistic and true-to-life it is as the everyday revelations aren’t necessarily always that involving. Perhaps a little more pace will be brought before opening night, perhaps a number or two could be cut, but then it becomes a more sensitive issue when it is other people’s voices that are being removed rather than the playwright’s own. Still I found this to be a powerful, solid four-star show and something admirably adventurous yet deeply empathetic and incredibly stirring: the voice of everyday people never sounded so special. To anyone unsure about booking, as with anything, but perhaps more so with this piece of theatre, approach it with an open mind and you might just be in for a great surprise and not just because of all the hanging baskets! It would be a real shame if the show’s chances were scuppered either by people’s preconceptions as to what they consider musicals to be or unwarranted controversy around misguided concerns as to the subject matter. Thanks for the review. Since it's end on, I'm assuming rows S and T will be good for this? 🙂 I saw this last night and loved it.  One odd moment of pacing – there was an enormous pause after the prostitutes appeared and spoke a couple of lines before the next musical sequence started up – did this happen to you? I wonder if there will be a cast recording.  Sounds a bit bizarre for a show like this, but I'd love to have the trial sequence in particular on CD.  Fascinating compositions. Pharoah… : your rows S&T will be fine. There's only a couple of moments where they are far back underneath the band 'box', but they're always moving forward so you won't miss hardly anything (and nothing vital) DeNada: yes, we had the silence too, just assumed it was a technical hitch! Glad you loved it too though, I think it will be a hard sell but absolutely, totally worth it. Just back from the final preview – brilliant and unique as a piece of theatre.  Flawed of course, but this is a genuinely new genre – it must get a wider showing! I found it deeply moving – wry, empathetic, and ultimately uplifting. Not at all what I'd anticipated from the evening. Great performances, wonderful storytelling. A truly unique piece of theatre and an evolution of the documentary form. As someone who lived in the town at the time of the murders it was always going to be a difficult show to watch but one that really works to convey the sense of fear, distrust and shock that enveloped the community in Dec 06. Sure that you will have compared notes with a few others on this one, but the silence part way through the second half is part of the show and definitely not a technical hitch! I must say I found it a really moving effective part of the play….I thought it was perhaps trying to evoke the eerie silence of being out alone at night in a small town city. Maybe they've changed it slightly to make it more obvious since the previews, as when I saw it the whole audience didn't even stir during this."

814,814,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2020,Ian,Santi & Naz, VAULT Festival,"The recasting of historical narratives through the eyes of those whose stories are rarely heard is one of the most culturally significant things theatre can do, IMHO. So The Thelma’s Santi & Naz is certainly right up my street, as it explores Partition through the eyes of two young women. They’re fast friends, the bestest of best, but as Santi is Sikh and Naz is Muslim, it’s a relationship that is destined to become more tangled. But where Guleraana Mir and Afshan D’souza-Lodhi’s play takes us, is into a more intimate, but no less complicated, version of their world. Director Madelaine Moore captures much of the heady rush of intense friendship – the dancing, the rule-breaking, the temptations… And Ashna Rabheru’s Naz and Rose-Marie Christian’s Santi match up beautifully in their exuberant energy, even as emotions start to shift on all levels."
815,815,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2013,Ian,Routes, Royal Court,"I was initially quite hesitant about booking to see Routes – the murkily complex worlds of immigration and what was the UK Border Agency (UKBA) are all too familiar to me from aspects of my work and so I wasn’t sure that I wanted to see a dramatic interpretation of the painful intricacies of the legal system that so many people are forced to endure. And though Rachel De-lahay’s play, her second for the Royal Court, has a vivid compassion and a burning sense of injustice, it never really dealt sufficiently with its subject matter for my liking, barely scratching at the surface of something so rotten in the state of Great Britain. She intertwines a number of stories, all to do with immigration and citizenship and how precious the rare flashes of humanity are, that survive in this system. Fiston Barek’s teenage Bashir has spent most of his life in the UK but at the slightest hint of trouble, finds his indefinite leave to remain under threat and a forcible return to Somalia on the cards. His roommate in his hostel is Calvin Demba’s Kola, a troubled youth offender disowned by his parents, one of whom works for the UKBA. And in Nigeria, Peter Bankolé’s Femi is trying to beat the system by buying a fake identity to be able to join his family in the UK."
816,816,Ought To Be Clowns,01/12/2016,mag9l,Her Aching Heart, Hope Theatre,"The Hope Theatre’s Gothic Season winds to a close with a slightly more positive take on the genre – festive-gothic perhaps – in Bryony Lavery’s Her Aching Heart. A pastiche of Gothic literature in which modern day Harriet and Molly find themselves both reading the same lesbian bodice-ripper novel, it just so happens the main characters are called Lady Harriet Helstone and Molly Penhallow, and so we see connections build between both their real and literary selves as they take the first steps in a putative relationship. Directed by the Hope’s AD Matthew Parker, the re-enactment scenes are quite frankly hilarious. Split into chapters with titles like ‘A Nun Has A Nightmare’, ‘A Buxom Young Wench And A Sprightly Old Woman’ and ‘Thorns’, the love/hate tug of war between village lass Molly and society lady Harriet is fast-paced and funny, with a tip of the hat, a wink of an eye and its tongue very much in cheek. They meet on a hunt when Molly tries to save the fox, played by a hand puppet, and once the broad and bawdy humour starts, it rarely relents.  Lavery’s script brilliantly skewers the florid language of many a kind of novelist with its “lackadays”, “uluating bosoms” and pronouncements like “the sun streaks like a basset hound across the fields”. And in the hands of plumly-accented Colette Eaton and dramatic damsel Naomi Todd, its always over-the-top but never overdone. Even with its “knobs and knockers”, the humour is spot on, absolutely jam-packed with witty visual gags, from the fire that ‘glows’ to animal CPR to the best chandelier-swinging swordfight you ever did see. Eaton and Todd also take on all the supporting characters of the story with great relish, from saucy maids to horny stableboys, but in the parallel story of the contemporary Harriet and Molly, there’s something genuinely affecting. This is where Ian Brandon’s score comes in, seven original songs that punctuate the silliness (whilst still mining the rom-com standard of having phones with impossibly long cords) and tracking their emotional journey from unhappiness into the hopefulness of new love. It may give people expecting a full-blown musical some pause but structurally, its a fascinating approach. Rachael Ryan’s design of devoré drapes and velvet curtains is suitably lush and theatrical and the construction of a false wall deals wonderfully with the practicalities of so many quick costume changes. Tom Kitney’s lighting is delightfully playful in enhancing the meta-theatricality and Paul Freeman’s sound design also has fun, as well as balancing with deeper moments, especially when we unexpectedly find the romance in the cod-romance of an amusing but poignant bed scene."
817,817,Ought To Be Clowns,15/06/2005,Ian,Henry IV Part II, National Theatre,"I’m not sure what it was about this show that made me like it so much more than Part I, but I felt that the whole ensemble was pulling together much stronger: Susan Brown as Mistress Quickly and Eve Myles as Doll Tearsheet,the two women hankering after Falstaff were both good, Jeffery Kisoon as a fading Lord Percy roused great emotion for his fallen son and Gambon continues his excellent comic work. David Bradley was much better here as the physically frailer King on his deathbed, stretched by his doubts and self-pity, but John Wood and Adrian Scarborough as Justices Shallow and Silence are scene-stealingly good with their comic relief scenes which were probably the best bits of the entire six hours. Scarborough is especially good as he also plays Hal’s sidekick Poins with little time to change but managing to affect a massively different physical performance."
818,818,Ought To Be Clowns,20/09/2013,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Shakespeare’s Globe,"It’s taken me a while to get around to the Globe this year – their Tempest was fine but not particularly inspired and so my enthusiasm for booking for Macbeth and A Midsummer Night’s Dream waned. But the thought of missing Michelle Terry was not one I was prepared to countenance and taking a chance on an Indian summer, I booked for a random Friday matinée for the latter, hoping that the rain would hold off. Fortunately it did and with perhaps my lower expectations, I was entirely dazzled by Dominic Dromgoole’s production of what is one of my favourite of Shakespeare’s plays, which cast the newly opened Michael Grandage adaptation firmly in the shade.  When the workmen are first revealed to be camp northerners, my heart sank a little as the broader brushstrokes of Globe comedy haven’t always been my favourite things, but there is something remarkable about how Dromgoole makes it work. Quigley’s take on Nick Bottom is quite different, a downplayed, almost melancholy soul, dripping with acid contempt but with a warm crinkling of the eyes keeping it from being too vicious. Having them be a clog-dancing ensemble provides obvious entertainment but also subtly reinforces the bond between them, and their enactment of Pyramus and Thisbe is unadulterated pleasure, a riot of physical comedy, visual gags and the joy of performance, particularly in Christopher Logan’s Flute eventually blooming as Thisbe. There’s real joy too in seeing Michelle Terry flourishing into the ranks of our premier actors. From the opening masque where Athenian battles Amazon, we see this is a reluctant enforced partnership between Theseus and Hippolyta and she never lets him forget it – Hippolyta too easily fades away in that opening scene but Terry ensures she is a vibrant force in the ducal chamber and throughout, keeps John Light’s Theseus on his toes with constant reminders that she may allow herself to become his equal but never his subservient partner.  This vitality is carried forth into fairy land too where the same actors take on the warring Titania and Oberon, Light really coming into his own here with a hugely physical performance, swinging on ropes and climbing columns, and it is apt that his (rough) magic is fearsomely shouted rather than delicately incanted. His fervour comes from a place of burning jealousy and intense love, as we see bitter recrimination writ all over his face as he sees what he has reduced his fairy queen to, so I wasn’t a hundred percent sure what to make of the homoerotic overtones of his relationship with Puck, delightful as it was. And all this work has the knock-on effect of evening out the play so that the lovers’ quarrel no longer forms the focal point but instead is just one of any number of interesting and hilarious sequences. Working with such an uncut version of the text makes it less out-and-out funny than it often played these days and this brings an almost haunting depth to some of the viciousness of the insults, even as we’re still laughing at the last cutting jibe. Luke Thompson and Joshua Silver emerge the victors with their duelling Lysander and Demetrius, Thompson particularly amusing with his physicality; Olivia Ross and Sarah MacRae are strong but never quite hit the same level for me – this is one area where Grandage might just have the edge. "
819,819,Ought To Be Clowns,29/01/2012,Ian,The House of Bernarda Alba, Almeida,"The list of actresses whom I adore is forever growing and changing but certain women remain constant on it, and one of them – who I never thought I would get to see on stage – is Shohreh Aghdashloo. She completely broke my heart in the film House of Sand and Fog (for which she was Oscar-nominated) and then toyed with our loyalties with a brilliant duplicitous turn in series 4 of 24. So when she was announced as taken on the titular role in the Almeida’s new version of The House of Bernarda Alba, I was ecstatic. Emily Mann’s adaptation relocates Lorca’s Spanish story to rural Iran and changes a few of the names, but largely keeps the architecture of the play intact (although compressed into 95 minutes here). It is a relocation which is extremely successful, the oppression and repression of female sexuality sadly fitting in as easily here as in Catholic Spain and class issues are common across the world, making this a powerfully affecting, beautifully staged and haunting production that lived up to my every expectation. The first time I saw Bijan Sheibani direct was at the National with the exceptional Our Class which won me over completely and marked him out as a director to watch out for. His subsequent efforts though have tested my patience: Greenland was a hodge-podge of ideas; Moonlight brought new meaning to the term soporific for me; and though The Kitchen had much balletic grace about it, it all felt, well a little pointless. So I was a little intrigued to see whether which side of him would emerge in Bernarda Alba. Thankfully, my fears were allayed within the first minute with one of the most gorgeous opening images I think I’ve seen in a theatre, I’ll say no more than I am seriously considering going again just to see the shimmering veil of silk one more time… But beautiful images aside, and this is a production filled with them – Sheibani’s eye for the visual is superb, the swathe of burqa-clad mourners, the jolt of the green dress, a family dinner of great tension – there’s a clear-sightedness to the direction, a deep understanding of the key issues of the play that is transmitted throughout. The device of the camera flash that is used sparingly during the show, reveals crucial unspoken truths and concealed emotions to devastating effect and Jon Clark’s lighting and Dan Jones’ sound design are both deployed with a similar restraint which makes them all the more evocatively powerful. And then there’s the acting. Aghdashloo’s voice alone is enough to make me weak at the knees, the very definition of mellifluous, but allied here to a performance of vicious matriarchy and dictatorial obsessiveness that destroys the very thing it seeks to protect. She’s a thoroughly believable monster, a woman who still possesses enough glamour to make one believe she would never accept a shepherd in the family and who exudes enough danger to ensure her will is (mostly) obeyed. Jane Bertish’s Darya plays off this perfectly as the housekeeper who serves as the maternal figure in the household and the person who can come closest to challenging Bernarda with her hard-earned wisdom. And in the bevy of daughters, Pandora Colin finds great dignity as the middle-aged Asieh (Angustias) who is finally given the chance of freedom with an unexpected proposal, Amanda Hale finds a disturbing physicality as the wretched Elmira (Martirio) whose inability to deal with her emotions causes so much pain, Sarah Solemani makes a wise Maryam (Magdalena) and Hara Yannas’ Adela is sensational as the wild spirit that will not be tamed by anything, fully aware of her body, her sensuality and unafraid to show it, regardless of the consequences."
820,820,Ought To Be Clowns,19/04/2006,Ian,Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Apollo,"Edward Albee’s 1962 play centres around George and Martha, an unhappily married couple for 23 years, who after an evening out invite a newly married couple who work in the same university department as George back to theirs for drinks. But when they start to fight in front of their guests, the poisonous atmosphere envelops all of them and really lays bare how much of a battle marriage can become. She drinks too much and enjoys the fighting, but George is equally complicit as this is the only kind of interaction that gets their juices flowing these days. As the entire original US cast have transferred with the production, it means that we get the benefit of a cast clearly comfortable in their roles and in their interactions with each other. This was most notable with Kathleen Turner’s huge generosity: the role of Martha can dominate this show utterly but Turner works with her co-stars, giving them room and playing off them wonderfully. Bill Irwin is also wonderful, with a chilling perma-smile across his face no matter what his wife throws at him and with his snake-like gestures build in a more subtle way but to a terrifying climax that makes him easily the equal of Turner. As the visiting couple, David Harbour and Mireille Enos have much less to do in their minor parts but both succeed in making their presence felt on stage as George and Martha’s titanic struggles forces the weaknesses in their own new marriage to be exposed."
821,821,Ought To Be Clowns,18/01/2012,Ian,And No More Shall We Part, Hampstead Downstairs,"If you’re suffering from the January blues, then the theatre can often provide a convenient respite. But be careful about the show you pick, as following on from the tear-jerking Lovesong at the Lyric Hammersmith is another piece that seems determined to make you reach for the tissues – Tom Holloway’s And No More Shall We Part. A play about assisted suicide is rarely going to be easy viewing and in the intimate space downstairs at the Hampstead Theatre (I unwisely chose to sit on the front row), this two-hander is gently uncompromising stuff. Pam is suffering from some unspecified terminal disease and has decided that she wants to take matters into her own hands and end her life whilst she still has her faculties and her dignity. But when the time comes, the tablets take much longer than anticipated to take hold and over several hours, horrified husband Don is forced to watch as the end comes, agonisingly slowly. The wait for release is interspersed with scenes from the recent past as we see Pam informing Don of what she has decided and his struggle to accept her wishes. Stirring stuff but rather than go down the emotional manipulative route that Frantic Assembly took with Lovesong, James Macdonald’s production has a certain emotional distance about it with his two stagehands sat either side of the stage, passing up props to the actors and cueing light and sound in clear view. With the play taking place on a shiny (and ugly) black revolve, the effect is a little disconcerting and in some ways feels at odds with the naturalistic acting. But where the revolve does work is in allowing the action to flow easily from past to present, from the dining room discussions to the tormented bedside wait. And it is most compellingly acted: Dearbhla Molloy plays the peaceful calm of a woman fully resolved to her course of action perfectly, a tower of unwavering single-minded strength softly explaining her reasoning and seeking support from a disbelieving partner. As Don, Bill Paterson has the tougher job, clearly a lot less keen on the idea of euthanasia and certainly not ready to say goodbye to his wife despite her determination. The play’s most affecting moments come from his face as he battles his doubts to come to some sort of acceptance and to embrace the fact that this is what she wants. This struggle continues even at, especially at, the bedside when the end seems so close and yet so far away and is delicately but urgently portrayed by Paterson. Holloway’s writing is certainly thought-provoking, pushing us to think about the responsibilities of the decisions we would make and I think this is the only area where I felt he left Pam get away too easily perhaps. The way in which the couple’s children are excused from making an appearance at the final dinner is neatly done, but throws up one of the biggest dilemmas about the whole issue. How does one balance the wishes of the dying against the wishes of the living, Pam’s ‘selfishness’ in her determination to do everything her way can be seen as harsh – I don’t think I could have accepted having the last time I would be with my whole family taken away from me with the same equanimity that is apparent here – but also as highly protective, this is an illegal activity after all. Having cried buckets at Lovesong, I was surprised to remain dry-eyed throughout this. That’s not to say that I wasn’t moved, but rather that it studiously shirks such overt emotionality and not always to its credit. Tonally it remains too flat even when shifting between time periods, and the pace doesn’t really vary enough, meaning that moments of dullness crept in. When the flashpoints come, they are gratefully received as they jolt the attention but again, it’s not always for the best – at one point the sweet reminiscences from the past are shoved aside for a dramatic revelation from each which ultimately leads nowhere."
822,822,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2017,Ian,Everything Between Us, Finborough,"Though it might not necessarily seem like it, I do sometimes miss plays – David Ireland’s Cyprus Avenue being one such example from last year, a rare moment of me deciding that I didn’t want to see it (only partly because I’d pretty much had the shock aspect of it ruined). Ireland is now being acclaimed as “Northern Ireland’s boldest contemporary writer” though and so the Finborough have opted to revive his earlier play Everything Between Us in their Sunday/Monday/Tuesday slot. After decades of conflict, both politically in terms of Ulster as a nation and personally for sisters Sandra and Teeni Richardson who haven’t spoken in a good few years, the notion of truth and reconciliation seems a noble if unlikely one. But as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Northern Ireland sets up shop in Stormont with politician Sandra representing her Protestant brethren, Teeni comes crashing back in her sister’s life to force negotiations on that level too. Neil Bull’s production scarcely draws breath as Hurricane Teeni dominates the earlier action with her racial abuse, the vivid reasons for her absence from Sandra’s life, the darkly comic gaps in her knowledge due to this exile. But as she delves into personal history, into the complex childhood they shared with a loyalist paramilitary for a father, the vast issues of religion and politics can’t help but overshadow all, especially once Sandra finds room to chip in with her own experience."
823,823,Ought To Be Clowns,25/10/2010,Ian,Broken Glass, Tricycle,"Broken Glass is one of Arthur Miller’s later works and so has often suffered by association from the weaker tail-end of Miller’s output, but this production at the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn, cast to the hilt, certainly makes the case for this play. Set in Brooklyn in 1938, Sylvia has lost the use of her legs after being traumatised by images in the newspaper from Kristallnacht and the news filtering through about the ever-growing extent of anti-Semitic activity in Europe under the Nazis. Her doctor diagnoses a hysterical paralysis but as he begins to investigate her life, he discovers that the problems may lie closer to home, in the truth behind her relationship with her fastidious husband, Phillip. The Holocaust connections are actually secondary to the real storytelling here which is entirely about the Gellburgs’ marriage. And it is this point which has informed director Iqbal Khan’s interpretation: although ostensibly set in a specific time and place, the emotion involved is timeless and so rather than being a period piece, this production takes a metaphysical, ruminative approach. To ensure the contemplative mood, the interludes between the scenes are filled with Laura Moody’s expressive cello-playing, beautifully composed short solos from Grant Olding which are explosive with emotion and counterpoint the repression evident on stage. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a better display of emotional constipation than Sher’s work here: on the face of it, the character of Phillip Gellburg is dull and unexciting but Sher invests him with layers upon layers of interest as a man utterly conflicted by his Jewishness. Proud to be the only Jew at his property firm, yet crawlingly blind to his boss’s barely concealed attitudes; at times malicious to his afflicted wife for fear of being thought responsible but also tender as can be when he is reminded of their deep love for each other. The tightly-coiled energy suppressed inside of him is manifestly evident in Sher’s rigid-backed performance and the way in which the intensity is maintained is something to behold. As the paralysed Sylvia, Lucy Cohu is simply magnificent, suggestive of Meryl Streep at times, matching the complexity of emotions one often sees in Streep’s work: here a faded version of the vibrant woman of Phillip’s memories, muted and troubled by confusion and grief with occasional flashes of animation as long-hidden emotions are stirred, colour returning to her beautifully modulated voice and a gorgeous sensuality emerging. And provoking that sensuality is Nigel Lindsay, in what one assumes will be his last straight acting role before surrendering to nightly green make-up applications as Shrek, who is excellent as the charming GP Harry Harman, rocking a pair of mighty fine riding boots (which I ended up finding strangely alluring too so one can’t blame Sylvia too much) and struggling to maintain his professional detachment in the face of the discoveries he is making of the personal lives of the Gellburgs and his growing affection for Sylvia. But full credit has to go to the three supporting players too: Madeleine Potter works wonders with the meagrest of material as Harman’s wife, a fiercely intelligent person in herself and a true partner to her medic husband; Emily Bruni as Sylvia’s plain-spoken sister provides lots of dry humour and Brian Protheroe makes the most of his barely-there anti-Semitic boss. Mike Britton’s design is beautifully done: opening the stage out to quite some depth and keeping it largely uncluttered forms the non-representational playing space. The marital bed that is at the root of so much trouble is ever-present, walls covered in peeling aquamarine paint suggest decay, clear screens occasionally provide a divide and also keep the passion of Moody’s cello playing contained from the actors. Miller’s writing is well crafted here but I wasn’t fully convinced that the marriage of the personal and the political was so smoothly done: the evocation of Kristallnacht could even be seen as a shortcut to attempted deeper significance from what is a personal story about marriage. But a stellar ensemble led by astounding performances from Sher and Cohu perfectly complement Iqbal Khan’s interpretive production which works wonders on this play, teasing out an elegiac beauty from a metaphysical study of a deep identity crisis: very highly recommended. Glad you like the boots, Ian. They are beginning to grow on me, too, although a mighty pain to take on and off. Appreciate your commitment to and obvious love of theatre. All the best – Nigel Lindsay (not yet green!) it's Hyman not Harman 🙂 Thanks for reading. Hope this gets the rumoured transfer into the West End for the New Year, you thoroughly deserve it."
824,824,Ought To Be Clowns,11/07/2015,mag9l,Orson’s Shadow, Southwark Playhouse,"When a play is “based on true events”, there’s always a tricky line to tread as the very nature of theatre is to be, well, theatrical and the truth be damned. And when the subjects are such well-known luminaries as Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier with a side helping of Joan Plowright and Vivien Leigh and rounded off by Kenneth Tynan, the blurring between fact and fiction is even further tested, especially if you know anything about these figures. Austin Pendleton’s Orson’s Shadow centres on Welles’ ill-fated decision to direct Olivier in Eugène Ionesco’s Rhinoceros, at Tynan’s instigation as the playwright would have it, all three men in their twilight of their careers or at least a crossroads on the part of Olivier. From Tynan’s machinations to make this happen to the rehearsal rooms of the Royal Court where egos clash and sparks fly – though married to Leigh, Olivier’s co-star Plowright was also his lover – it’s a titanic battle between genuine titans. Which makes it a shame that the characterisations here are ultimately so one-dimensional. Adrian Lukis’ Olivier is basically a cartoonish portrayal of a man already at the extremes, Gina Bellman is hamstrung by writing that only allows her to show Leigh’s declining mental health and not much more, and Louise Ford is a little muted as a Plowright just trying to keep out of it. With strokes this broad, it is hard to feel like we’re actually learning anything aside from stagey people are #stagey."
825,825,Ought To Be Clowns,09/07/2014,mag9l,The Importance of Being Earnest, Harold Pinter Theatre,"Does the West End really need another straight production of Oscar Wilde’s old war horse The Importance of Being Earnest? Apparently not, as the new productions lined up each have their own spin – 2015 will see David Suchet take on the role of the redoubtable Lady Bracknell for Adrian Noble and 2014 sees Lucy Bailey impose her own conceit onto the show which allows her to gather an ensemble of more seasoned professionals than might normally be expected to take on this play. That she does with the help of extra material written by Simon Brett which sees this starry cast take on the mantle of am-dram society The Bunbury Company of Players who in turn, are putting on their take on Wilde’s play as part of their summer season. So before Algernon and Jack have even taken to the stage, we’ve been inducted into the mini-dramas of the company themselves – Nigel Havers’ lothario now having an affair with a third woman in the group, Siân Phillips and Patrick Godfrey’s long-married couple fussing and bickering, Cherie Lunghi’s would-be diva complaining about her costume not fitting… The scene thus seems set for a melding of onstage and offstage drama which would bring something new to this old classic.  Sadly though, having set up this little den of intrigue, Bailey proceeds to pretty much ignore it as the Bunbury Players then go through an increasingly interruption-free dress rehearsal of the play which is as standard as they come. And in the first act, it is a pretty laboured interpretation too which takes a little too long to find its feet (two weeks of previews have passed, one more is to come) as the cast move from ‘amateur actors playing characters badly’ to simply playing the characters. Instead, the pleasures – if you are so inclined to find them – come mainly from Nigel Havers prancing around like a baby giraffe and shaking his well-conditioned mane at every conceivable opportunity, someone book him a shampoo ad quick. Fortunately, the second act is much tighter, thanks to the sterling efforts of Lunghi as the sharp-tongued Gwendolyn Fairfax who brilliantly executes the faux politesse of her first meeting with Christine Kavanagh’s Cecily Cardew as they try and figure just which of them is engaged to the man they think is called Ernest. And the glorious Siân Phillips makes a very droll Lady Bracknell, reducing Rosalind Ayres’ Miss Prism to a quivering wreck with just one withering glance, relishing the bartering of the marital affairs of her charges with Martin Jarvis’ foppish Jack , yet still finding a touch of genuine deep emotion as the mystery of the baby in the handbag is finally resolved. But all of the stories of the Bunbury Players that set up the play are forgotten, never mentioned again as the framing device is barely used again except to wrap things up in the final seconds. Which is a real shame as it just highlights the more interesting possibilities that Bailey could have run with here, especially with such a wealth of experience in her cast that is rarely tapped into. Instead, we just get yet another Importance of Being Earnest and not even one that is particularly worth getting that excited about. "

827,827,Ought To Be Clowns,11/03/2016,mag9l,The Mother, Tricycle,"If it ain’t broke, why fix it? The extraordinary success of The Father, now back in the West End for a second run ahead of a UK tour, has resulted in the Tricycle inviting another Florian Zeller play over from Bath. And if The Mother doesn’t quite scale the same heights of exquisite agony, it houses another storming lead role for another great British actor, Gina McKee following in Kenneth Cranham’s esteemed footsteps. In the bleached white desolation of Mark Bailey’s design, wife and mother Anne is being hollowed out by depression. Triggered in the main by her adult son Nicholas’ departure from the family home, her sense of empty-nest-syndrome is exacerbated by her severe doubts about her 25 year long marriage to Peter, an upcoming trip to Leicester for a conference masking what she thinks is an affair, her confusion multiplied by her fondness for a bottle, pills or alcohol, either will do. Zeller enjoys toying with audiences through the structure of his plays, a playful sense of manipulation present as we see scenes being repeated but with variations, often small, often crucial, always casting into doubt what we hold to be reality. The Mother actually preceded The Father in its writing but it’s a shame it has arrived second here as it feels slightly less assured, slightly less significant than its successor whose disorientation was intrinsically linked to dementia."
828,828,Ought To Be Clowns,30/11/2017,Ian,Yellowman, Young Vic,"As part of winning the Genesis Award, a programme supporting creatives in the “early stages of their professional lives”, the Young Vic offers winners the chance to put their talents to work in its smaller places. This year, it is the turn of director Nancy Medina who is mounting a short run of Dael Orlandersmith’s 2002 play Yellowman in the intimate space of the Clare, though without an official press night. It’s a brutal but fascinating look at racism within the black community, as Eugene and Alma grow up in 1970s South Carolina, negotiating the difficulties that come from having parents with different skin tones. The darker-skinned Alma is firmly on the wrong side of the tracks whist Eugene, lighter-skinned but derogatorily referred to as ‘yellow’, has a wealthier family, but one who experiences no less prejudice. What emerges is a kind of class war, as Eugene and Alma defy societal pressures to become friends and then lovers but remain unable to shake off the full impact of the bigotry that surrounds them. Christopher Colquhoun and Nicola Hughes play the lovers but also the vast array of supporting characters and Medina ensures there’s an intelligent clarity between them all, indicating the importance accorded to their status in this world."

830,830,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2015,mag9l,Hangmen, Royal Court,"The term ‘dark comedy’ is much abused but there really is no better descriptor for Hangmen, Martin McDonagh’s long-awaited return to theatrical writing. Set (mostly) within the tobacco-stained walls of a proper boozer in Oldham in the 1960s on the day that Britain has abolished the death penalty, landlord Harry’s (the excellent David Morrissey) past comes back to haunt him in a big way. For he was the last hangman in the country, as evinced by a cracking prologue (that isn’t for the squeamish) that sees him and his assistant Syd go about their business. The arrival of enigmatic Londoner Mooney (Johnny Flynn never better) is the catalyst for the plot, as Harry’s disaffected daughter becomes easy prey to his professed affections and disappears with him, round about the same time Syd reappears in Harry’s life to say something rum is going on with a serial killer who has a Southern accent. But the real joy is in the motley crew of grizzled regulars who gather in the pub and the cracking dialogue McDonagh gives them as they dance around the morbid curiosity that has called them to this pub rather than any others.  With zero concern for anything vaguely PC but equally no sense of rose-tinted nostalgia either, McDonagh’s writing is a bracing blast of cigarette-scented air that is unrelentingly funny, even as the screws of Matthew Dunster’s production tighten with the plot twisting and darkening pretty much from the word go. Morrissey captures wonderfully the arrogance of a man unwilling or perhaps incapable of relinquishing the past, the confrontation with bitter rival (and now fellow publican) Pierrepoint is a real highlight thanks to John Hodgkinson’s striking cameo."

832,832,Ought To Be Clowns,10/07/2017,Ian,Queer Theatre – The Drag, National," Last but by no means least in this queer season is the one play written by a straight person and perhaps the queerest of the lot. Mae West wrote The Drag in 1927 where its frankness about gay lives (and once again, drag ball culture!) scandalised its out-of-town Connecticut and New Jersey audiences so that it never made it to Broadway. But Polly Stenham has opted to revive it for this reading and to introduce it to a new (Alaska Thunderfuck-literate) crowd.  To be brutally honest, it isn’t the greatest play in the world, but what it does do is hold a fascinating mirror to early 20th century attitudes and how tolerance and intolerance existed side by side, then as now; the safe spaces gay men find in order to be their extravagantly true selves equally as timeless. And closet cases in marriages remain a sad truth, if not quite as dramatic as the son of a homophobic judge married to the daughter of a gay conversion therapist that we get here! West revels in the scandal that the outing of her protagonist at one of his regular gay soirees causes, but she’s also sensitive to the realities that gay men – many of whom she was friends with, advocate for, employer of – faced in the world that scarce treated her much better. Stenham has a real ear for West’s caustic wit (Tom Edden definitely slaying here) and you can see a) why she picked the play and b) how she could well turn this into a full production worth seeing.

833,833,Ought To Be Clowns,11/07/2012,Ian,Timon of Athens, National Theatre,"Relevance. From the moment that Timon of Athens was announced as part of the upcoming season at the National Theatre with its look-alike poster image, it was clear that this would be a production straining for resonance in the modern world. This is nothing new of course – the recent Antigone opened with an evocation of the capture of Bin Laden, the RSC have relocated Julius Caesar in a modern-day African dictatorship, numerous Comedies of Errors have touched on people-trafficking – but in his quest to update this neglected Shakespeare problem play for our times, Nicholas Hytner seems to have suffered very much from square peg round hole syndrome. Aspects of this production may well improve as the preview period progresses, my problems with it ran much deeper. Timon starts the play as a major player on the London social scene, showering the city and his acolytes with his financial largesse and a dubious open door policy. But such cultural and personal philanthropism comes at a serious price when it emerges that Timon is in fact bankrupt and when he turns to those who he has lavished with money and gifts, they turn their back on him and offer no help. He exacts a stinking revenge on them during a feast and then retires from society to become a bag lady. Even then, an unexpected discovery means that he cannot truly escape his former life but his influence is channelled into a darker stream of action as civil unrest is steadily growing. Clearly, the play’s themes of the unsustainability of conspicuous consumerism and the selfishness born of such greedy materialism have a powerful currency in the modern world and the opening images of the (pre-)show invoke the spirit of the Occupy camps. However, the social turmoil that bubbles under for the most of the show is more directly evocative of last summer’s rioters, which casts a slightly different complexion, muddying the water a little as the point being made here. And try as they might, the updating to modern scenarios feels painfully forced and very rarely a natural fit. Part of the problem undoubtedly lies in the play itself, largely acknowledged to be a collaboration with Thomas Middleton and an unfinished one at that. For those in the know, this production uses the 1623 First Folio text with cuts and amendments to about 250 lines and small portions of text included from other Shakespeare plays. Not having seen the play before, I’ve no point of reference aside from to say that on first viewing, it lacked dramatic impetus and narrative clarity. Only in the second half does it start to come together, as the high conceit is dropped and Timon’s introspection is allowed to breathe simply. Whilst the Travelex season is undoubtedly one of the best things to happen to the National in recent years, it has had an unfortunate knock-on effect on the budget for shows and this is often most painfully apparent in the set design. Faced with the cavernous space of the Olivier, Tim Hatley condenses the space by inserting a large wall which is then endlessly flexible in creating the various city scenes of the first half. Some, like the gallery that is named after Timon and the party room with its dance scene (a team of seven Royal Ballet dancers are alternating the two roles here in a rather oddly ostentatious move), work effectively; others, which rely on the dropping in of painted London backdrops, seen through a large window, are cheap and tawdry. I wasn’t much keen on the wasteland look of the second half either.  Performances are still percolating, but once again Hytner’s approach was not one I was inclined to. Simon Russell Beale (an actor for whom I have yet to have that Damascene moment with) appeared a little too occasionally like he was treading water, familiar mannerisms abounded and little psychological depth felt explored. The Lear-like casting out into the wilderness was his high point, but the poignancy marred by his frequent flouncing around (for want of a better term) in the too-large space. Ultimately though, this was just not a character in whom any interest developed for me. However, a greater crime is the muting of Deborah Findlay’s natural vivaciousness. As Flavia, the gender-swapped faithful steward, she feels slightly mis-cast, the chemistry with Russell Beale not currently working and the style of vocal delivery chosen is curiously flat and just doesn’t play to her strengths.   In a large supporting cast, the predominant note is of broad over-playing which makes it hard to get really involved with these scenes and keep track of the sub-plots. Only Hilton McRae’s gnomic Apemantus and Ciarán McMenamin’s spirited rebel leader Alcibiades emerged with any real credit. And to characterise the whole muddled approach, Hytner flips the whole style of the show in a bizarrely directed final scene which comes out of nowhere and radically alters the mood, just as the production was finally finding its feet. It left me perplexed and simply served to highlight my disappointment with the whole thing, especially as it is part of the London 2012 Festival and the World Shakespeare Festival. The audience around me largely disagreed (though one got the feeling they would have ecstatically applauded Simon Russell Beale had he just sat down and read the paper for 2 and a half hours) so who knows – it’s a could-do-much-better from me. Thank you! I saw the play on 10 July and agree with your perceptive comments."
834,834,Ought To Be Clowns,01/09/2010,Ian,The Maddening Rain, Old Red Lion Theatre,"Felix Scott, star of one man show The Maddening Rain, was apparently in Inception. I can’t say I noticed him but then I wasn’t looking out for him, IMDB says he was playing ‘businessman’ and looking back I think he was in the bar in the middle section of the whole dream sequence. But I did however recognise him from his numerous turns in the Tricycle’s Women, Power and Politics season of plays so was keen to see what move he made next. The Maddening Rain is a monologue from Nicholas Pierpan, following the fortunes of a man who arrives in London from Leicester and is soon swept up into the cut-throat world of corporate finance with its endless chasing of women and profit. As the financial crisis hits the City though, we then see the impact of the global recession from a different perspective. Director Matthew Dunster’s approach feels fairly minimal in that it is full of subtleties rather than grand statements, which works in some respects and not in other. The shifting mood lighting and muted soundscape were both really effective, but in not giving Scott much rein to move around, the production just feels too static too often. Which is a shame, as Scott’s performance is often mesmerizingly good. Navigating his way through an unfriendly world, looking for money, hoping for love, our narrator treads the line of likeability and it is Scott’s affability that pulls you through, his impersonations of the people around him are often hilarious. But there’s not enough material for him to genuinely work with and get ‘into’, it ultimately feels quite self-conscious."
835,835,Ought To Be Clowns,26/06/2012,Ian,Damon Albarn’s Dr Dee, ENO at the Coliseum,"It wasn’t intention to revisit Damon Albarn’s Dr Dee now it has arrived at the ENO’s home at the Coliseum, but as I haven’t learned to respond to any offer along the lines of “I have a spare ticket…” in anything but the affirmative, that was where I ended up tonight. I actually caught this show last year when it premiered as part of the Manchester International Festival (review can be read here) and though my feelings were decidedly mixed, they were generally positive, especially given that the work was still raw and fresh, only having recently come out of workshopping. A year down the line, changes have been made to the show, but I have to admit that my feelings were still largely quite ambivalent. Based on the historically significant, if neglected, figure of Elizabethan Dr John Dee, Albarn and director Rufus Norris have created something of a spectacle, but even after the refinements that have been made, it remains something of a perplexing piece. Dee’s biography reads as a thing of great fascination, a key advisor to Elizabeth I, he was a man whose extraordinary breadth of knowledge took in astrology, alchemy, philosophy, mathematics and much more besides but when this unquenchable thirst lead him to increasingly dabble in the occult, he sowed the seeds of his own downfall. But you would be hard-pressed to gather much of this from the events onstage. On the one hand, one could argue that this is a show less concerned with biographical detail and focused on providing a kind of pageant-based display. Norris’ staging works in some truly striking imagery and there are several moments of visual grace, especially in the astronomical sequence. But this doesn’t disguise the fact that it is simply perplexing for large swathes, something exacerbated by a lack of lyrical clarity (and the baffling decision not to have surtitles), the basic thread of storytelling thus ever-elusive throughout. And though much of the staging is cleverly done, there’s a little too much recycling of ideas which becomes somewhat exasperating by the end. Musically, it remains an interesting panoply of varied influences, some operatic, some not so much, played with skill by the band on their raised stage, led by Albarn’s troubadour narrator figure. Though this role has been slimmed a little, it still rankles with me rather, feeling more like an ego-trip than a strictly necessary part of this show particularly in his decision to give himself the final self-aggrandising piece of commentary and song. Hand in hand with this is a beefing up of the role of Dee himself who now has more of a (singing) voice, which in itself is perverse as Bertie Carvel who played the role, and was disappointingly under-utilised, in Manchester has now been replaced by Paul Hilton. The cast do what they can but it has to be said that the acting is not necessarily a strong point to Dr Dee."
836,836,Ought To Be Clowns,12/06/2017,Ian,Danny and the Deep Blue Sea, Old Red Lion,"After a well-received run at Theatre N16 last year, Courtney Larkin’s production of John Patrick Shanley’s Danny and the Deep Blue Sea has popped up again at the Old Red Lion, an ideal home for its striking intensity. Danny and Roberta are two lost souls, trapped in their own vicious cycles of despair but finding themselves propping up the same Bronx bar one night and possibly, just possibly, locating a chink of light on the horizon by the end of their encounter. At first sight, there’s not much to the play, not much ‘happens’ per se, so Larkin’s direction wisely focuses on its emotional potency. Gareth O’Connor’s angry loner Danny and Megan Lloyd-Jones’ traumatised Roberta are both excellent as they each self-excoriate, wielding violence within and without, but increasingly finding a kind of kinship that allows them to establish the kind of connection and intimacy they’ve been missing for so long."
837,837,Ought To Be Clowns,16/12/2019,Ian,Three Sisters, National Theatre,"A cracking cast heralds the return of Uncle Vanya to the West End early next year but even with Conor McPherson and Ian Rickson on adaptation and directorial duties respectively, it’s hard to get too excited about what – on the face of it – looks to be a fairly conventional interpretation (I could well be proven wrong, and hope I am…). For me, there’s something much more appealing, and thrilling, about people willing to grab Chekhov by the scruff of the neck and yank him way out of the familiar. Robert Icke and Simon McBurney replanting The Cherry Orchard in the Netherlands, or Inua Ellams and Nadia Fall relocating Three Sisters to 1960s Nigeria. In the latter case, the result is a challenging but exhilarating reworking, set against the backdrop of the Biafran Civil War but retaining much of the Chekhovian structure, so that we feel the weight of all the tragedy that has to come. The skill of Ellams’ writing – this is dubbed a new play, after Chekhov – is knowing when to dovetail with his source material and when to allow his own choices to flourish, bringing with them a raft of glinting surprises that break through the familiarity (that some of us have).  The three sisters here are Lolo (Sarah Niles), Nne Chukwu (Natalie Simpson) and Udo (Racheal Ofori), members of a prominent Igbo family shuffled out of Lagos after the death of their father and chafing at the realities of their new provincial life. Those realities turn a lot uglier with the seccession of the Republic of Biafra and as we visit the family over a period of three years, we see how war and politics, with a healthy dose of neocolonialism, refract on love and life. Yes there’s tragedy but there’s also a large swathe of comedy too – rarely has Chekhov been this funny – a necessary variety of tone over such an epic work.  And it does feel epic. Peter Mumford’s sun-bleached lighting uses shadow exceptionally well to suggest the danger lurking in the corners of Katrina Lindsay’s expansive design, with Fall conjuring some powerful performances from a deeply talented company. Niles’ Cassandra-like Lolo railing against both the corrosive British influence and its resulting tribal calamities, and a sensationally passionate Simpson rebelling against the arranged marriage she’s been in since age 12 by jumping Ken Nwosu’s military man. Making Ronkẹ Adékoluẹjo’s sister-in-law Abosede a Yorùbá woman supercharges that dynamic too, to devastating effect, the public ethnic conflict made entirely personal.   "
838,838,Ought To Be Clowns,17/06/2018,Ian,Kiss Chase, Bunker,"Have you ever been on a speed-dating night? I haven’t (I’m not quite sure how a gay one would work, how do you make sure you’ve seen everyone in the room…answers on a postcard!). So the idea of Kiss Chase – the second show from theatre company Second Circle, written and directed by Hannah Samuels – was an intriguing one, as it promises “a part-interactive, part-verbatim speed dating event” in the confines of the Bunker Theatre, with the bar staying open throughout! We’re welcomed in warmly by co-host Ruth, serenaded with the rules of the evening by t’other Jim, and then let loose on a series of mini-dates as those with red stickers on their badges move around the room one seat at a time. And the activities to do on these dates are fun enough, wisely steering clear of any place where lines might end up getting crossed and a relief for me given the number of women in the room and my rustiness in that particular game… And as it turns out, this is only half the story, as the matchmaking is interspersed with snatches of verbatim testimony, offering up powerful mini case studies of the unlucky in love. Those who constantly choose the ‘wrong’ person to be with, those craving lifelong security even in these unlikely of circumstances, those hung up on romances of the past which are proving difficult to shake off. We’re gently encouraged to share our own stories too, should the mood take you."
839,839,Ought To Be Clowns,30/04/2015,mag9l,Follies in Concert, Royal Albert Hall,"An early birthday from my Aunty Jean saw me get to revisit those wonderfully swiveling seats at the Royal Albert Hall for the matinée of Follies in Concert, a semi-staged version of the Sondheim show directed by Craig Revel-Horwood for just two performances with an all-star cast, featuring none other than Diane Lockhart herself, Christine Baranski. Having never seen the show before, I have nothing to compare it too but after hearing the score played by the City of London Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by the inimitable Gareth Valentine, I suspect I may never need to hear another version!  The set-up of a reunion concert for an old theatrical troupe as per James Goldman’s book works wonders for the show and especially this production. There seemed to be real joy and appreciation amongst the company as they watched their colleagues each take their turn to reprise their former glories – Anita Harris and Roy Hudd’s light-hearted skip through ‘Rain on the Roof’, Stefanie Powers’ glamorous swish through ‘Ah, Paris!’, Lorna Luft’s quirky take on ’Broadway Baby’, Betty Buckley raising the roof with a soaring ‘I’m Still Here’ – whether the onlookers were acting or not, seeing them give each turn hugs, kisses and standing ovations felt real. The icing on the cake in this sequence for me though was ‘Who’s That Woman?’, featuring a seemingly tireless tap-dancing Anita Dobson and some of the most effective choreography of the show. It is no secret I’ve long been a fan of Andrew Wright’s work, going back to the delectable Once Upon A Time At The Adelphi, and once again he delivered the goods, giving us not just spectacle but real emotion through the dance as all of the women came face to face with their younger selves in a powerfully effective montage that used the movable frames of the set most ingeniously. The move into the ‘Follies’ of the second half sees the focus settle more firmly on two unhappily married couples with inextricably intertwined destinies, as their true emotions come to light in both the past and present. As the younger incarnations, Laura Pitt-Pulford and Alistair Brammer, and Amy Ellen Richardson and Jos Slovick all got their moments of innocent exuberance but the real power comes with the experience of life. Peter Polycarpou’s Buddy’s vaudevillian smile fading to a grimace, Ruthie Henshall’s Sally breaking every single heart in the room with the controlled anguish of ‘Losing My Mind’. Birthday boy Alex Hanson did well with ‘Live, Laugh, Love’ to close up but the highlight here came with Christine Baranski living up to my sky-high expectations in ‘The Story of Lucy and Jessie’, full of flirtatious fun as she sat in an audience member’s lap and took a fake selfie, mingled marvellously with the male company dancing around her, and generally giving this London audience proof positive – as if it were needed – of her vastly underrated talents. It capped off a brilliant afternoon and scratched that Follies itch perfectly – I really don’t think I need to see it fully staged now and if I did, it would have to have Anita Dobson tap-dancing in it or else there’ll be trouble!"
840,840,Ought To Be Clowns,01/10/2014,Ian,Hamlet, Citizens,"It was with a little hesitation that I went to another Hamlet so soon after the extraordinary (and criminally under-rated) efforts of Maxine Peake and co but work circumstances conspired to land me in Glasgow (city of my alma mater) and so I made my first trip to the Citizens Theatre. And though Dominic Hill’s creative vision has its own unique stamp, it was interesting to note the parallels that emerged in these two re-envisionings of Shakespeare’s work. The personal rather than the political was foregrounded (it’s been a rough year for budding Fortinbrases) as the sphere of the play became a domestic one once again and I have to say I love Hamlet as a family drama. The spin on the relationships possess a real power when the scope of the play is thus reduced and their dynamics gain in intensity. Pushing it as far as they do here in Glasgow, one could even argue that the play is transformed into an ensemble drama. Hill’s Hamlet plays out in the Glasgow gangland of the Cold War era – the men are real men, the women there to look pretty and everyone loves a drink. Peter Guinness’ Claudius is a suave capo, Roberta Taylor’s Gertrude’s an alcoholic clinging bitterly on, Cliff Burnett’s vivid Polonius is (probably) abusing Meghan Tyler’s punkish Ophelia, and Adam Best’s Laertes thrashes things out over a punchbag. In the midst of all this, it is little surprise that Brian Ferguson’s prince initially seems weak and reserved, this version of Elsinore is no place for a man with feelings. But the extent to which he adapts to the matter at hand suggests that the apple has no’ fallen far from the tree as any innate goodness becomes overwhelmed by the prevailing testosterone-fuelled violence that permeates the air – I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Hamlet this nasty and I think I like it."
841,841,Ought To Be Clowns,05/02/2015,Ian,Anything Goes, New Wimbledon Theatre,"Sheffield Theatre’s production of Anything Goes is launching on a simply mammoth tour of the UK – over 30 venues in 10 months – so it’s a pretty good job that it’s a largely excellent production. It’s rather amusing to note the number of reviews that mention that this classic show is over 80 years old yet still point out that the much revised book isn’t anything special at all but merely a framework on which to hang some of the most glorious songs of Cole Porter’s career. Given the average age of the audience, this will not come as a surprise to anyone, but there’s much here in Daniel Evans’ production to commend it to the young’uns too. Alistair David’s choreography is a real delight, a constant breath of fresh air on which the show floats giddily, whether it’s the leads fooling about as if they’re Fred Astaire, sailors mooning over bathing beauties, or the whole company possessed with a spiritual glee. The eye is of course drawn to the stunning Act 1 finale set to the title track (which will always belong to Kate Capshaw’s bizarrely translated version in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, my first experience thereof) which is a jaw-dropping, shoe-shuffling, tap-dancing dream, cleverly referencing classic moves but also firmly establishing its own identity by keeping Debbie Kurup’s sensational Reno Sweeney front and centre. Kurup is a real revelation as Reno (though not entirely unsurprisingly, I loved her in the original cast of The Bodyguard) stepping up to this leading role with a wonderful breezy confidence that flows so naturally and reclaims the part for a younger generation away from the divaish connotations that the likes of LuPone and Paige have lent it in recent decades. Matt Rawle doesn’t quite match up to her in terms of charisma as male lead Billy Crocker – he’s definitely the bottom while she’s the top – but Stephen Matthews’ bumbling Englishman connects beautifully with her and their rapport is one of the show’s undoubted highlights."
842,842,Ought To Be Clowns,01/06/2013,Ian,Even Stillness Breathes Softly Against A Brick Wall, Soho Theatre,"The lives of the two characters in Even Stillness Breathes Softly Against A Brick Wall start off the most mundane of circumstances: tales of crowded commuting, office politics at the lower end of the scale, doing battle with mercenary credit card and mobile phone companies. But the niggling unease at the stifling monotony of the 9 to 5 has been building up for far too long and when war breaks out in some far-off land, it triggers some deep contemplation into how everyday life there would be affected and in turn provokes a questioning of their own existence.Thus we bear witness to their lives simultaneously imploding and exploding into jagged chaos. Brad Birch’s enigmatic writing was sparked by a piece of his own poetry – the 4.5 pages of an introduction to the playtext may seem indulgent but actually prove an interesting read – and it maintains much of that feel. A lyrical complexity plays with repeated imagery and phrases to enrich the at-times gnomic text with a sense of thematic unity, but Birch mainly eschews simplistic narrative for an opaqueness of meaning and purpose which frustrates as much as it intrigues. Rebelling against their situation are ‘Him’ and ‘Her’ as they retreat from their all-too-ordinary lives to cocoon themselves in the imagined safety of their flat. Joe Dempsie and Lara Rossi both give commendably committed performances as these partners in life who are somehow occupying different spaces, their words are constructed more like two monologues intertwined than actual conversation yet there’s a strong sense of interconnectedness which means you thoroughly buy into the heady rush of their relationship and appreciate the different speeds at which they are moving."
843,843,Ought To Be Clowns,03/03/2013,Ian,Privates on Parade, Noël Coward,"Just a quickie to cover this return trip to Privates on Parade, the opening show of Michael Grandage’s 5 show takeover of the Noël Coward Theatre, as I was able to attend the final performance of the run thanks to the day-seating efforts of a friend. I liked the show immensely when I saw it at the end of last year and whilst I could see that it might not be to everyone’s tastes, I was somewhat surprised at the charge of ‘dated’ that some people levelled at the play. Perhaps it’s a conversation that needs to be had with someone who actually felt that way but it feels erroneous to me, not least because it’s not even set (late 1940s) when it was written (1977). The biggest change of course was due to the untimely and sudden death of Sophiya Haque who played the role of Sylvia. I can’t imagine how difficult it must have been for the company to continue after such a tragedy and all credit to understudy Davina Perera who rose to the challenge of taking on the role full time mid-run and achieving a seamless transition. Otherwise, I enjoyed the show just as much as I did first time round and having a better sense of the play as a whole, I appreciated the emotional depths of the writing that much more, the comedy has a more astringent edge in the knowledge of what is to come. For me, this was Simon Russell Beale at his best. He’s an actor whom many have raved about to me for years now, yet I’d never seen him in a role which seemed to justify such praise. But as Captain Terri Dennis, everything seemed to click into place – emotive drama, twinkle-eyed campery, singing, dancing and a joie de vivre that proved utterly irresistible. I genuinely hope he’s had as much fun as he seems to have had performing the role as indeed the rest of the company have as well. Angus Wright’s colonial throwback, John Marquez’s delightful Brummie, Joseph Timms’ fast-maturing Flowers, Grandage really did assemble a top notch group of actors to ensure his ambitious season got off to the best of starts."

845,845,Ought To Be Clowns,02/10/2018,Ian,Pinter Two – The Lover/The Collection, Harold Pinter Theatre,"Truth be told I’m not much of a Pinter fan though I do find the occasional production to be sufficiently compelling to keep me coming back to test my prejudices. And so the Pinter at the Pinter season certainly piqued my interest, if getting me rushing out of the door to book – it took a crucial recommendation to get me to the Harold Pinter for Pinter Two – The Lover/The Collection and I have to say I’m glad I allowed myself to be persuaded.  Both directed by Jamie Lloyd, they offer complementary but contrasting 60s aesthetics (beautifully realised in Soutra Gilmour’s design) – the first part more a sitcom going strange, the second a darker, more mysterious prospect from the off. And cast to the hilt in some of the most luxurious casting a single West End season has ever garnered, it’s all really rather captivating.    The Lover sees Hayley Squires and John Macmillan as a seemingly conventional couple whose picture-perfect suburban exterior hides a predilection for some heavy-duty fantasy and roleplay. As they dip in and out of characters, the price on their IRL relationship becomes increasingly clear, especially once they move off the same page, and some exceptional lighting work from Jon Clark demonstrates the emotional toll even whilst the language becomes increasingly absurd.    The Collection is a queerer thing, literally, as Squires and Macmillan are joined by David Suchet and Russell Tovey as a pair of couples caught up in the frisson of suspected infidelity. Tovey’s gym-built Bill lives with Suchet’s Harry, is accused of sleeping with Squires’ Stella and flirts up a storm with Macmillan’s James. He luxuriates in the ripeness of Pinter’s prose here, weighting every pause with testosterone and is partnered excellently by Suchet’s prim older man with his determination not to be abandoned.  "
846,846,Ought To Be Clowns,19/07/2011,Ian,For Once, Hampstead Downstairs,"The Michael Frayn Space downstairs at the Hampstead Theatre has become something of a hot venue. A space for more experimental fare than one might be accustomed to in Swiss Cottage, it has not been a place where press critics have been invited to, instead encouraging audience feedback as plays are developed there. But in a change of policy, the doors to Pentabus Theatre’s For Once were opened and deservedly so, as it is a beautifully written, powerfully affecting play. It is playwright Tim Price’s debut work, though he is one to watch with an upcoming play forming part of this year’s Donmar at Trafalgar Studios season and another commission for National Theatre Wales appearing next year. And with this three-hander about a family recovering from the aftermath of a terrible car accident that has sent shockwaves through the isolated rural community in which they live, he demonstrates a real skill for sensitive storytelling, resonating with a genuine understanding of the emotional interplay of people struggling to return to everyday life. By using three overlapping monologues from Sid, the 17 year old left blind in one eye by the accident that also killed three of his friends, his mother April and his father Gordon, Price avoids focusing on the crash itself but instead slowly builds up a picture of life both before and after the accident, showing that rural charm has its limits even for those who live there. He suggests that the restlessness for teenagers in a small town with nothing for them to do could be extended to the adults too, as Gordon tells of his little escapades to b&bs in other towns to pursue his deeply repressed feelings and April struggles to deal with the looming empty nest syndrome. The play is supported by three superb performances, all suggesting the loneliness of their different grief: Geraldine Alexander’s heartbreaking April, desperate to able to help her child whilst recognising he is growing up beyond her mothering reach; Patrick Driver’s inarticulate father, unable to express his true feelings about anything any more; and Jonathan Smith, simply astounding at capturing the gawkiness of late teenage-hood thrust cruelly into the real world and maturing before our very eyes as he comes to realise the impact of what has happened has spread far beyond the immediate effects on himself."
847,847,Ought To Be Clowns,16/05/2013,Ian,Cuddles, Oval House,"Many a play purports to send chills down the spine but precious few actually manage the act of setting the hairs on end with moments of genuine chilling revelation. But Cuddles, Joseph Wilde’s first full-length play which has just opened upstairs at the Oval House, managed just that with its pervasive air of dark fantasy gone wrong and one of the most shocking moments one will probably see all year in a theatre. Rebecca Atkinson-Lord’s direction keeps the intensity of this show almost oppressively high, challenging both her actors and her audience, but emerges with a flawed gem of a production that won’t be easily forgotten. Shut away in her room in a castle, Eve is a 13 year old vampire whose only visitor is the (human) Princess Tabby who dispenses food, whether sandwiches or blood, and affection, cuddles of varying levels. But in the real world, Tabby is Eve’s big sister and a young woman aching for a taste of normal life and as she seeks to satisfy that hunger with a likely young chap named Steve, Eve’s own determination to pursue her desires theatens to disrupt all the carefully constructed systems they have put in place to manage day to day life. Wilde meshes an unnerving combination of fantasy and reality into the 80 minutes running time and further ensures we’re never sat too comfortably by incorporating a vein of refreshing and often brutal comedy which undercuts and overlaps the growing unease that comes from venturing into the world of this teenage vampire and her frustrated carer, gradually uncovering more of their personal histories and winding its way to its haunting climax.  Carla Langley – undoubtedly a name to watch for the future as shown by her scintillating debut in Desolate Heaven earlier this year – is perfect as Eve, bringing an unfiltered rawness to bear that is highly affecting and rightly uneasy. And Rendah Heywood as the emotionally damaged Tabby makes a convincing case for why she needs to exert such control over her life now and has most of the spiky humour – her take on chuggers is particularly amusing."
848,848,Ought To Be Clowns,12/03/2012,Ian,‘Tis Pity She’s A Whore, Cheek by Jowl at the Barbican,"A quick glance at my Top 25 Plays of 2011 on the right sidebar will show you that Cheek by Jowl’s The Tempest was one of the absolute highlights of my theatregoing year and so by rights, I ought to have been highly excited for the company’s return to the Barbican with ‘Tis Pity She’s A Whore. But it was the Russian sister company that took on Shakespeare last year and my only other experience with CbJ’s English work was a rather painfully dull take on Macbeth, also at the Barbican, which meant I was a little equivocal about this prospect. Great word-of-mouth persuaded me to take the risk though, booking for late in the run, and it was well-founded as it turned out to be a highly inventive, energetic and deeply sexy evening at the theatre. It was my first experience of the Jacobean tragedy, a cautionary tale about the problems of wanting to bonk your sister, which has been thoroughly revitalised in this modern-dress version which pulses along with the punchy soundtrack that starts the show along with a rather fun full-cast dance routine. Giovanni comes back from university, full of incestuous thoughts about his sister Annabella who is being pursued by a number of suitors. But as it turns out, she only has eyes for her brother too and though she ends up betrothed to Soranzo, watched by the vengeful Hippolita, the ramifications of their love have a deadly impact as religion, culture, corruption and morality collide. Much like the Young Vic tried to do with their recent similarly modernised take on The Changeling, the text has been edited and compressed into an interval-less running time – a shade under 2 hours here – but where Joe Hill-Gibbins’ work ended up feeling quite (literally) messy, Declan Donnellan has maintained a fantastic clarity to the story-telling. So even as more characters are added to the mix and the sub-plots kick in, there was never any doubt in my mind as to what was going on (this does not happen as often as it should!). Much of the strength of CbJ’s work evidently comes from the ensemble that is brought together and who work together so well throughout the show. When their characters are not onstage the players frequently form a Greek Chorus of sorts, whether it’s watching the action whilst eating pretzels on the bed, muttering and whispering and chanting evocatively at the protagonists, or maintaining a physical presence at the edges of the stage. It’s always effective, highly atmospheric and often simply used, but there’s always a precision here that makes every single gesture and utterance an integral part of the work. And within the group, there are the types of performances that really pull you into the story, whether you want to or not. Chief amongst these is Lydia Wilson’s Annabella, a spiky Lisbeth Salander type with a partly shaven head, tats, attitude for days but crucially too, a deep well of emotional truth that forces the tragedy of the situation to the forefront. Wilson is profoundly affecting, especially as the consequences of fraternal love play for out for her in the most unfortunate way, and I found I could barely take my eyes off her. Jack Gordon as her puppyish brother was also compellingly good, the impulsiveness of his actions evident from the outset and I thought Jack Hawkins’ Soranzo also did well as the man who is lumbered with Annabella and her baggage. Though what I found interesting was the lack of censure of these characters, especially the incestuous ones, which must have been a very brave move by Ford when he was writing the show, but one which really works especially thrown up against the hypocrisy of the Church here. Indeed it was one of those shows I could happily name-check every actor: Suzanne Burden’s vituperative Hippolita, Laurence Spellman’s excellently charismatic Vasques, Lizzie Hopley’s tragically gossipy maid Putana, David Mumeni’s beautifully pert Grimaldi…the list goes on. Throw in Nick Ormerod’s bed-dominated design and Judith Greenwood’s gorgeously suggestive lighting, a predilection for having the mens’ shirts fall off at regular intervals and an aesthetic that always felt accessible rather than arch, and I was left with the feeling that I’d seen the best thing I’ve seen all year. Indeed it was tremendous.  I love the phrase ""pert Grimaldi"" which is absolutely true of David Mumeni! Hehe, isn't it just 😉"
849,849,Ought To Be Clowns,18/04/2019,Ian,Sweet Charity, Donmar Warehouse,"When the light lands just right on Robert Jones’ set for Sweet Charity at the Donmar Warehouse, it sparkles like silver; the rest of the time, it is rather grey. Sadly, that’s pretty much rather true as a whole for Josie Rourke’s production here, her farewell as Artistic Director here. Those bright spots are dazzling. Debbie Kurup and Lizzie Connolly are superb as Charity’s pals and co-workers Helene and Nickie, dreaming their dreams with real circumspection. Martin Marquez’s velvety smoothness is charm personified as movie star Vittorio Vidal. And Adrian Lester is a vision in silver sequins as a sensational Daddy Brubeck though taking Sondheim a little too much to heart. Rourke has employed a revolving list of guests to cover this cameo, a gimmick that may have been earned over her tenure but doesn’t feel necessary. Then there’s Anne-Marie Duff as Charity herself. Her voice is something of a blunt weapon here, albeit one finessed by her undoubted acting talent. So she can goof appealingly through ‘If They Could See Me Now’ and match Arthur Darvill’s nerdish Oscar in ‘I’m The Bravest Individual’ as her indefatiguable spirit goes through a range of knocks. But put her against the irrepressible vocals of Kurup and Connolly as in ‘There’s Gotta Be Something Better Than This’ and you’re left wondering why you’d put someone who isn’t a bona fide musical theatre star in an iconic piece of musical theatre like this. Maybe I’ve been spoiled by seeing the likes of Gemma Sutton and Rebecca Trehearne in the role recently but this just didn’t work for me."
850,850,Ought To Be Clowns,24/10/2015,mag9l,Hello Again, Hope,"The show is made up of 10 two-handers, connected by one character remaining in the next scene, so first we have The Whore and The Soldier, then The Soldier and The Nurse, The Nurse and The College Boy and so on until The Senator and The Whore completes the cycle. But the timeline is played non-chronologically, the characters aren’t necessarily the same person from scene to scene, the only real connection is the multitude of ways in which sex is used and abused in our daily lives, no matter how sexuality is perceived in that particular age. Directed by Tania Azevedo for Play Pen Productions, Hello Again shines as a strong piece of musical theatre. LaChiusa’s compositional style is notoriously challenging (as recently witnessed in See What I Wanna See) but the eclectic nature of the score – with over a century of musical influences to draw on – works in its favour, reflecting the scattered narrative. MD Daniel Jarvis brings colour too both from his playing and from arrangements which occasionally fold in additional voices to the songs. And as the merry-go-round goes round, commonalities do appear – the longing for some kind of connection in a brutal world, the return to sex as a last hurrah in times of crisis, the unthinking behaviour that can characterise mismatched libidos. It isn’t the cheeriest of pieces to be sure, there’s little sex here for pleasure but what there is is a defiantly non-romanticised picture of carnal relations for both men and women and what they mean to humanity at large. Each actor takes on two of the roles and they’re all delineated expertly, especially in the immediate scene changes – Thea Jo Wolfe is superb as The Young Wife (her solo number is the show’s strongest musical number) whether with playing with college kids in a cinema or trapped by a repressed husband, Joshua Leclair’s instant switch from third class Titanic passenger to 70s gay clubber is wryly done, and Miles Western, Isabella Messarra and Adam Colbeck-Dunn also impress.  The show is never truly explicit, heaving bosoms and a couple of butt-cheeks aside, but it is surprisingly, pleasingly, frank about the darker side of sex and desire in all its irrationality and irresistible nature. And with Andrea Marsden’s inventive set making things even more intimate (I haven’t been that close to a stripping woman in, well, forever!), it’s worth saying hello to Hello Again."
851,851,Ought To Be Clowns,25/10/2016,mag9l,Apocalypse Cruise Ship Love Affair, Above the Arts,"Beach Comet have clearly found their niche in creating spoof B-movie musicals and so Apocalypse Cruise Ship Love Affair now tracks the same path that its older sibling Vampire Hospital Waiting Room did last year, in following up a successful Edinburgh run with a short London residency at the Above the Arts Theatre. And just like its forerunner, it is hugely daft and hugely enjoyable – the perfect tonic as the nights close in and the clocks roll back.  The plot – insofar as such mundane things are relevant – involves the deranged Captain Bleufonde’s determination to resurrect his dead lover by steering his cruise ship into the eye of a devastating storm, plus cruise rep Hanks Leeroys’ struggles to abide by his rule to never fall in love with a passenger upon meeting nun Evie. But what makes Apocalypse Cruise Ship… really fly (or sail, whatever) is the sharpness of its comedy. Theo McCabe and Steve Duffy’s book is magnificently resplendent – and relentless – in rapid-fire gags, stuffing this hour absolutely chockful of humour. From the wonderful silly accents to Beyoncé-inspired dance routines, visual gags (the ‘lock’ of Mandy’s hair is still making me giggle now) to cabin-fuls of frustrated sexual tension (including horny OAPs), the jokes come thick and fast in (tidal)wave after wave – it leaves you breathless at times."

Vaginismus is a psychosomatic condition that makes sexual intercourse painful or even almost impossible due to muscle spasm during penetrative sex and through an uncompromising performance from Lydia Larson, we discover what impact such a thing can have for a young woman navigating her way through contemporary society."

The 3 James plays at the National can be (and will be) viewed on the same day and so too can the three parts of Noël Coward’s Tonight at 8.30, touring the UK after a run at the Nuffield. Blanche McIntyre’s production for ETT can also be seen in three separate chunks but the impact of the triple bill really helps the 9 plays feed off of each other and highlight the strength of the ensemble (and also pull you through the dips in quality that inevitably come with so much writing from one author).

855,855,Ought To Be Clowns,09/11/2018,Ian,Lands, Bush Theatre,"Leah likes a jigsaw, Sophie is fond of her little trampoline. But in the world of Lands, their preferences have turned into something more. Leah fills out her puzzles by giving detailed commentary on each jigsaw piece and Sophie, well she can’t remember when she actually last stopped bouncing.  Created by actors Leah Brotherhead and Sophie Steer with director Jaz Woodcock-Stewart, Lands emerges as a gnomic study of compulsive behaviour and how it impacts on those we love. Trapped in their own cycles of addiction, we watch as their unspecified emotional connection becomes severely tested.   Its vagueness might frustrate some, especially in the final third of its 80 minutes running time as it doesn’t really develop much from its main theme of emotional estrangement. But I found it hypnotically engaging – Brotherhead’s running descriptions are genius and Steer has a real openness to her performance."
856,856,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2020,Ian,The Misadventures of David and Sam, VAULT Festival,"With its combination of welly-throwing, pigeon murder, tongue magic and any number of decent 80s tunes, The Misadventures of David and Sam makes for quite the fun piece of family theatre at the VAULT Festival. David and Sam are young farmers from 1914 who want to tell us a story with the help of their gran and their cow Daisy. They just need to stop squabbling, and keep Granny awake, and make sure Daisy doesn’t disappear… Liam Cullen and George Wing are hugely appealing as this effervescent, energetic pair, ably accompanied by Michelle Pittoni’s granny (and her under-utilised uke). Throwing in the daftest magic you ever did see, moments of gentle audience participation and a hefty dose of slapstick, their charm has us gleefully skipping up, down and around the surreal twists and turns of their tale, the details of which ultimately matter less than the joy of the storytelling itself.  
 Though a family show, the writing does flirt with something deeper at times. The WWI references, however fleeting, can’t help but be charged with poignancy and some of the humour does end up cutting near the bone (that cancer joke…). In many ways though, this just adds to the multilayered feel, working to engaging older audience members as well as making them laugh. The range of pop culture references works to this effect too – Schitt’s Creek and Taken alongside Jack and the Beanstalk and Dick & Dom."
857,857,Ought To Be Clowns,24/07/2012,Ian,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, National Theatre,"Back in 2003, Mark Haddon’s Whitbread Prize-winning novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was somewhat inescapable. A murder mystery told from the perspective of Christopher, its quasi-Asperger’s Syndrome-suffering main protagonist whose investigations open up further mysteries that irrevocably change his neatly ordered life, it charmed many a reader with its quirky format and unique voice. It didn’t seem an automatic choice for a theatrical adaptation it has to be said but Marianne Elliott and the National Theatre have turned their hand to it regardless, employing a playwright who has had a ridiculously prolific year so far – Simon Stephens – to adapt it.  I caught the first preview, as I wanted to see it before I went on holiday, and as I missed out on tickets in the first round, I ended up in the ‘pit’, essentially a row of seats at ground level around the Cottesloe which has been reconfigured into the round by Bunny Christie in a design which is always visually arresting and endlessly surprising. Paule Constable’s excellent lighting design works beautifully with the swirling projection work, sequences of numbers tumbling all around, and Elliott has brought in Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett of Frantic Assembly to lend their inimitable style to some of the movement. It is a production that is overflowing with ideas, perhaps a few too many at the moment and the preview period will help refine this a little, but the way in which they combine to powerfully affecting effect cleverly stretches our sensory experience to suggest how differently some see the world.  Stephens has played with the format of the book a little to create a piece of theatre out of it and what results is a show of two halves almost. The novel that Christopher writes, based on his detective work into trying to find out who killed his neighbour’s dog, remains though in the first half and is mainly narrated by his teacher Siobhan, a beautifully warm and tender performance from Niamh Cusack, with the various scenes being played out by the company, led by Luke Treadaway as Christopher. Perhaps a little older than the specified 15 years, 3 months and 2 days than one might have expected, he nevertheless captures the awkwardness of a boy so intelligent in some ways, he’s about to take his Maths A-Level and yet so constricted in others as he can barely talk to strangers or cope with anyone touching him. His presence is initially a little muted by someone else narrating his story, but the second half flips this by focusing squarely on his personal odyssey (and also introducing a little meta business about putting on a play, which I have to admit flew over my head a tad – I think this was the sole major deviation from the book) and Treadaway rises to the challenge well as he pushes his own personal boundaries in pursuit of a new situation in which he can feel comfortable and offers us an insight into what his experiences are like.  Christopher’s condition, for want of a better word, is never named and so to criticise this for not being a realistic portrayal of such issues is to miss the point, especially given how deliberately theatrical it is. What does strike home though is the reality of caring for such a child and the stresses that it places on parents. As his struggling mother, Nicola Walker is beautifully, brutally open about her shortcomings and Paul Ritter’s taciturn father is excellently pitched, and written in both their faces, as they each go for the one touch that Christopher can endure and that has come to represent a loving hug, there are worlds of pain in the recognition of what they will never have.  Elements of humour  are threaded throughout – I loved the discovery of items in Dad’s bedroom – and with Sophie Duval stealing quite a few laughs with some excellent comic business; it is a completely delicious pleasure to see Una Stubbs on the stage, here as the neighbourly Mrs Alexander; and there’s even two animals onstage, one significantly, adorably, cuter than the other. The Curious Incident… is at times a sprawling, unwieldly challenge, but as the hubbub of the sensory overload returns and returns, it becomes clear that these are the difficulties (or an approximation thereof) that Christopher faces as the story unfolds around him in the most unfamiliar way. A clever adaptation of the book, an ambitiously multi-layered production, a set of beautifully sensitive performances – there’s nothing curious at all about how much of a success this ought be. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THESE ANIMALS ON STAGE. <3 Thanks so much for such a detailed review. Can't wait to see the play myself."
858,858,Ought To Be Clowns,15/07/2020,Ian,Hello Harry! A Celebration of 40 Years at Stage Door,,"Put together by Giles Terera, the guest list was truly astonishing, featuring a veritable who’s who of the theatre world, all connected one way or another with Harry through the 40 years of shows he has seen pass through the Shaftesbury Theatre. The sense of pleasure from the people giving their anecdotes – Anthony Hopkins in a terrible Hawaiian shirt, Dame Judi and Chita Rivera, Eddie Izzard and Johnnie Fiori – are a real testament to the power of being a thoroughly decent person, and a timely one too."
859,859,Ought To Be Clowns,23/09/2016,mag9l,Father Comes Home From The Wars (Parts 1, 2 & 3),"There is scheduled to be at least another six parts to Suzan-Lori Parks’ ambitious play cycle but don’t let that put you off, the three hours of Father Comes Home From The Wars (Parts 1, 2 & 3) are well spent in exploring race, slavery and the US civil war and how its pernicious legacy permeates through even to contemporary (US) society. Jo Bonney’s production is not always the easiest to watch but then how could it be, rather it seeks to provoke serious thought and consideration about what it meant – and what it still means – to be free. To take on such a grand narrative and possibly to alleviate some of the intense seriousness, Parks has playfully borrowed from a range of storytelling techniques, most notably the Greeks, And through them establishes her interpretation of the African-American experience – the magpie nature of Emilio Sosa’s costume design with details both period and present-day, reinforcing the continuing relevance of its message.  Part 1: A Measure of a Man sets us in West Texas in 1862 where slave Hero is given the chance to get his freedom from the plantation if he’ll join his Confederate master in battle. His wife, father and fellow slaves are split on whether he do it, conscious that the master has reneged on similar promises in the past, and discuss it at length. Sharper is Part 2: A Battle in the Wilderness where Hero and his master have taken a Union soldier prisoner, provoking revealing conversations about slavery and freedom between the trio. This section stands out – John Stahl is magnificent as the vituperative and racist Colonel and Tom Bateman handles the slippery role of the imprisoned soldier well, with Steve Toussaint’s impassive Hero at the centre, struggling to calculate his position in an uncertain world. Part 3: The Union of My Confederate Parts then returns Hero home to see just how much has changed – Nadine Marshall as his wife Penny and Jimmy Akingbola as sparring buddy Homer particularly well acted as they deal with the ramifications of continuing to live their lives."

861,861,Ought To Be Clowns,12/09/2011,Ian,Richard III, Old Vic,"Something of a rarity for me in visiting the final show of a run, here the final iteration of the three year transatlantic Bridge Project this time taking in just the single show, Richard III. The reason I left it so late was mainly because I hadn’t got a huge amount of will to actually go and see it, Propeller’s anarchic and inventive interpretation being so fresh in my mind especially after revisiting it just as this production opened at the Old Vic, and though my Aunty Jean was most keen to see it, by the time I got round to it, it had predictably sold out. Sod’s law dictates that tickets for a couple of shows in the final week emerged last minute but she couldn’t make it, but I snapped up a £15 bargain in the dress circle to go and see what all the fuss was about. The big selling point of Sam Mendes’ production was clearly Kevin Spacey in the title role and Spacey rises to the challenge to provide the grandest of performances. So much so that I was initially rather turned off by the overemphatic nature of his opening scenes, it felt akin to being hit by a sledgehammer of acting and left me wondering where on earth he was going to go from this grandstanding. Fortunately, he did calm down a bit to allow the depth of his portrayal to emerge: a malevolent spirit but not one born evil, but twisted that way by life and still able to keep a black humour about him, Spacey excelling with a sardonic rapidfire delivery. In the face of such a dominant lead performance, a robust company is needed and thankfully, that is what we have here. For me it was the women that stood out: Annabel Scholey impressing hugely as a sensual Lady Anne, Haydn Gwynne’s statuesque Queen Elizabeth a tower of repressed grief and barely suppressed horror at the machinations around her and Maureen Anderman’s embittered Duchess of York, a vacuum of maternal love. But it was Gemma Jones’ Queen Margaret, easily dismissed as a ranting bag lady in her rags but reinterpreted here as an avenging angel whose presence haunts each of the deaths that she prophesised, a highly effective decision that gently but deftly reminds us of the wider historical (and dramatic) context of Richard III within the first tetralogy. Not everything worked for me though. Chuk Iwuji’s slippery spin-doctor of a Buckingham was perhaps too modern, too self-possessed to convince as a King’s man and so mine the despair of his betrayal, one just got the feeling he would move onto the next client in a heartbeat, so perfectly did he capture the media-savviness of his kingmaker. Having two women play the Princes as public schoolboys felt slightly at odds with the rest of the production too, a strangely traditional choice. And I longed for a touch more innovation in Tom Piper’s spare staging, I’d’ve lost the captions and exercised more of the playful side that Mendes indulges only intermittently in locating the citizens as commuters on a tube train or the video spoofery of the rejection of the crown or the chilling juxtapositioning that accompanies the eve of Bosworth scene. Altogether I can’t say I was disappointed by this Richard III, or even bored although one can’t help but feel some of its over-extended running time could have been trimmed with a few judicious cuts. But something was missing to make it truly great theatre and I think it was partly due to the sense that I never really forgot that I was watching Spacey give a performance. An impressive one, the scuttling around the stage is magnificently done, but nonetheless never one which entirely subsumes him into the character. This is a strong production, and was rapturously received by the audience, but I couldn’t help but draw comparisons with Propeller’s utterly revelatory interpretation and in the end, those boys won it for me."
862,862,Ought To Be Clowns,07/04/2017,mag9l,The Glass Menagerie / Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf,,"“It’s an honour just to be nominated…” Come award season, these words are often heard but you do have to wonder what it feels like to be the only member of a four person ensemble that isn’t up for an Olivier Award. Such is the fate for Michael Esper in The Glass Menagerie just now, as Cherry Jones, Kate O’Flynn and Brian J Smith all find themselves deservedly up for acting prizes on Sunday while he’s had to put his game face on. Truth be told, his is the light that shines the least brightly in John Tiffany’s production, if only because the nominated trio are so brilliant. Here’s my original review and on second viewing, the textures and timelessness of the work really shines through. In the same way, and surely likely to figure heavily in next year’s Olivier nominations – if not eventual winners – are the company of Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?. I also went back to the Harold Pinter this week and it is remarkable how fresh and pacey the production still feels on a second viewing, whipping through its three hours with quite the lick and absolutely no diminishing of its immense emotional power. Read my review from first time around and get yourself over to see the show (again, if appropriate) for classic theatre doesn’t get much better than this."
863,863,Ought To Be Clowns,16/02/2014,mag9l,The Mystae, Hampstead Downstairs,"Whatever they’re smoking down at the Hampstead Downstairs, I approve and would like some. The Mystae (rhymes with fisheye, kind of) continues the more experimental feel that The Blackest Black started 2014 off with and features one of the more intriguing set designs that you will see this year. The play is set in an ancient Cornish sea cave where three teenagers have gathered to conduct a ritual before they scatter off to universities and jobs and somehow, Georgia Lowe has managed to carve an effective rock formation in the ground of Swiss Cottage, complete with ominously rising tidal waters. Technically, The Mystae is a pretty smashing piece of work even before any actors get on stage (or climb into the cave). John Leonard’s sound design brings the soothingly persistent sound of the sea to life (and later echoes brilliantly across the space), Simon Opie’s lighting suggests the secrets and surprises that could lie in any shadowy nook or cranny, and Tim Carroll’s production sparkles with excitement from the off. That it is then backed up by a nifty piece of writing by Nick Whitby is especially pleasing, a moody meditation on the intense emotional pull of this time of great change. Fresh from the end of college, Ina, Holman and Tre have been researching an ancient pagan ritual, the Eleusinian Mysteries, whose mind-bending properties they’re determined to sample before they all leave for uni. And through this trio, Whitby brilliantly channels the heavy weight of being a teenager in rural isolation and the need to escape it, if you can; the parochial sense of regional identity that counters that mindset; and the almost incestuous closeness that can develop amongst friends in said situations. "
864,864,Ought To Be Clowns,18/06/2013,Ian,The Night Alive, Donmar Warehouse,"With their summer programme, the Donmar opted for a Conor McPherson double bill and so following on from the extremely good revival of The Weir is a new play from the Irish playwright – The Night Alive. And it is unmistakably familiar territory – ruminative meanderings in an isolated Irish setting, probing into the delights, depths and depravity that humanity can stretch to in extraordinary circumstances but also in the day-to-day living of life.  Well into middle age, Tommy is a chancer, skirting along the fringes of life in the bedsit he rents from his elderly drunken uncle as he tries to keep his ex-wife and kids at bay and make a success out of any number of crackpot schemes dreamed up with his pal Doc. When he comes to the rescue of the battered Aimee and brings her back to his abode to recuperate, she opens the door to the redemptive possibility of a new world but alongside the hope that she offers, comes a very real sense of danger.  And it is this ominous edge that provides the dramatic tension in McPherson’s own production of his play, a creeping sense of menace that counters the customary banter that we’re used to. Michael McElhatton as the dopey Doc is brilliantly comic and moving in the same hangdog moment and Ciarán Hinds is extraordinary as Tommy – a haunted depth in his eyes suggesting he’s capable of great things yet knows they will never happen for him.  Yet something didn’t quite click for me with The Night Alive, certainly not in the way that The Weir did. I found it curious rather than compelling – were the playtext cheaper I would likely have bought one as I wouldn’t mind reading it to soak in the lyricism of McPherson’s text as there’s an obtuseness to much that happens, an elusive almost dream-like quality (might the final scene be a fantasy?) that forces its audience make its own decisions about what is left unsaid and unexplained, and there’s a fair bit of it. "
865,865,Ought To Be Clowns,13/07/2014,mag9l,The Confession Room, St James Theatre,"In this cut-throat theatre world, one takes the opportunity to celebrate new musical theatre writing where one can so there was little hesitation in booking for this one-off concert performance of Dan Looney’s The Confession Room at the St James Theatre’s downstairs studio space. I actually came across Looney as part of an evening celebrating another writer John Kristian last month so it was nice to be able join the dots a little here and see some of his work given theatrical life. This show received a concept recording from SimG Productions which was released on CD last year when a production also played the Landor for a night and tonight’s show, directed by Paul Foster with musical direction from Tim Evans, used the music from the recording along with excerpts of Patrick Wilde’s book to entertain an audience who’d opted to miss (the first half at least) the theatre of the World Cup final for some genuine musical theatre.  The ensemble-driven show focuses on a therapy group, full of people who have suffered a range of misfortunes in their relationships, lovelives and lives in general which they share with us all, under the guidance of their long-suffering but ever-tolerant counsellor. With a considerable number of people having signed up to confess, the issues that are blighting their lives stretch from the profoundly moving to the downright ridiculous, lending the overall piece perhaps too big a scope to really work most effectively. Or maybe it was just that the bawdier side of the sex comedy didn’t really tickle my funnybone. The show has been in development for a while – based on an original idea by Reece Looney and Dan Looney, Wilde was brought in to write the book whilst Sam Champness and Looney (R) provided additional lyrics for Looney (D)’s music and words. Even so, it strains a little too hard for shock value without any underpinning genuine humour so a couple of early numbers don’t quite hit the mark but as the show progresses, along with its emotional range, it works much better.  The heartrending tales of ‘Perfect’ and ‘Second Chances’ are both soaringly beautiful, Jon Robyns and Stuart Matthew Price delivering perfectly pitched renditions respectively, the female-driven ‘Let Me Just Dream’ harmonises spine-tingingly and the show’s best song ‘Excalibur93’ is given extraordinary pathos by Matthew Rowland’s appealingly nerdish Frank. Throw in a customarily great performance from Rebecca Trehearn (mark my words, she will be HUGE one day) as counsellor Caroline, it’s hard to resist the cumulative warmth of the show by the end."
866,866,Ought To Be Clowns,06/11/2018,Ian,Romeo and Juliet, RSC at the Barbican,"It’s sometimes a little difficult to take seriously how old everyone is meant to be in Romeo and Juliet but Erica Whyman’s modern-day production for the RSC, playing in rep now at the Barbican, never lets you forget. She fills the stage with kids for a cacophonous prologue, Karen Fishwick’s Juliet rightfully feels like a child and in turn, Mariam Haque’s Lady Capulet (“I was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid”) is a convincing 26, closer to her daughter in age than her husband, but emotionally distant from both.  It’s a pattern Juliet seizes the first chance to break when she meets Bally Gill’s charismatic Romeo, a young man very much still coming into his own. And you feel that it is the running away that appeals to her just as much as the running away together. For she’s all too aware that there are cycles of violence that the young’uns of this Verona can’t hope to escape – indeed what chance do they have when even all the adults around them carry and use knives to resolve even the smallest slight.   With such violence underscoring this world, there’s never any sense that this won’t be a story of such woe. The pleasure comes in looking at those who don’t quite fit in correctly. Charlotte Josephine’s brash Mercutio is like a streak of vibrant colour in this predominantly grey world, a woman forcefully establishing herself in a man’s world and overcompensating with it. Beth Cordingly’s Escalus has a similar struggle but is full of quiet fury as she tries to keep the peace. And a jolt of unexpected but real emotion comes from Josh Finan’s Benvolio, utterly and completely in love with Romeo and clearly thinking he’s in with a chance. Love it!      Tom Piper’s utilitarian cuboid design reflects the unforgiving nature of this Verona but even through the cracks, there’s hints that life and love can grow. Ishia Bennison’s beautifully compassionate nurse wears whatever bright colour she likes and there’s a verdant lushness to the cell where we find Andrew French’s Friar Lawrence. But the hope they offer proves too thin, particularly against Michael Hodgson’s quick-tempered violence as Capulet or Raphael Sowole’s menacing Tybalt. Fishwick and Gill combine sensitively and there’s a gentle thud of real tragedy that comes with the extinguishing of their hope of escape.     "
867,867,Ought To Be Clowns,21/10/2011,Ian,The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, Union,"I’m for goodness and for profit and for living clean and saying daily prayer”
I’m not the kind of gentleman who normally ends an evening with a lady in his lap but that was what (nearly) happened last night at the Union Theatre’s revival of US musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Inspired by a true story of a similarly-titled brothel , the Chicken Ranch is a well-established institution that has been passed down to Miss Mona from the original owner, who runs it with a veneer of classy respectability wherein she looks after her girls well and gets on with the local law enforcement to keep things running smoothly. But the decision of crusading news reporter Melvin P Thorpe to try and get the establishment closed down threatens everything. Sarah Lark plays Miss Mona, the role made famous by Dolly Parton in the movie of the same name, all big brassy blonde hair piled up on her head and possessed of a wardrobe stuffed with fringes and sequins and quietly understated as a warmly maternal figure. Her singing voice is lovely though lacked a little volume in places and there was a little gravitas missing from her portrayal, though that could square with her being pushed into the position of Madam through unexpectedly inheriting the place. And around her are her scantily-dressed girls who service the townsmen’s needs – mainly portrayed here through shadow-play – and most of whom are running away from something, assumedly also using the somersaulting skills that got one lady closer to me than I was expecting! Together they make a strong group – the harmonies of ‘Girl You’re A Woman’ most lovely, the mix of personalities entertaining and as a starting point for a show, it feels like a fascinating premise. It then feels a little perverse that the showstopper number is given to the boys in ‘The Aggie Song’ as a randy football team get ready to make their way down to the Ranch as a match-winning reward. There’s an element of redressing the balance here – they start off in boxers and only a few of them manage to button their checked shirts by the end of the song – and the overall effect of their barn-storming, line-dancing, top-tapping hoedown, choreographed by Richard Jones, is most impressive, making the most of the open stage in Kingsley Hall’s spare design. But what is most odd about the show is the way in which most of the work of the first half in setting up the various plot strands and establishing distinct characters within the large ensemble is then abandoned in the second. Larry L King and Peter Masterton’s book shifts to a very downbeat tone which almost flies in the face of the fun that has preceded it: that which we had not been taking too seriously is suddenly thrown into stark relief and consequently the gaping holes in the plot are exposed. That the ending then comes rather abruptly further compounds a disappointing second act which doesn’t deliver on the promise of the first. Directed by Paul Taylor-Mills, the 24 strong ensemble do work well though in this converted railway arch with strong character work: Leon Craig’s hi-falutin’, hallelujah-shrieking interfering reporter is huge amounts of fun, completely insane but still fun; James Parkes’ good-meaning Sherriff connected well with Lark’s Miss Mona and as the new arrivals to the Ranch, Franki Jenna’s confident Angel and Nancy Sullivan’s introverted Shy, both did well to inject more character into these girls than the writing allows. There are good vocals from Stephanie Tavernier and Lindsay Scigliano and my pick of the rest would be Jamie Papanicolaou for the boys and Jodie Lee Wilde for the girls, both being winkily suggestive at one point or another!"
868,868,Ought To Be Clowns,18/07/2015,mag9l,Sincerely Yours, Landor,"Christmas 1944 in an end-of-the-pier theatre in Clacton-on-Sea – Sincerely Yours sees a troupe of entertainers put on a show for the latest conscripts about to ship off to the front and looks at their lives both on and off the stage as Britain enters another year of war and they themselves go overseas to join the war effort. Part of the LAMBCO Fringe Festival at the Landor, it’s a sweetly-played nostalgic tribute to those who endured through wartime, and to those who did not.  The show is at its strongest in the production numbers, which are really rather impressive. Robbie O’Reilly’s choreography works well in the limitations of this space to still give a full tap routine with ‘Pack Up Your Troubles’ and keeps its tongue firmly in cheek when Carmen Miranda gets involved. Jennifer Sims, Sarah Goggin and Sarah Day are fabulous as an Andrews Sister-esque vocal trio, ‘Don’t Sit Under The Apple Tree’ and ‘Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy’, two highlights among many. Real poignancy comes too in the more reflective moments, the emotional clarity of Michael Webborn’s musical direction speaking volumes in a festive medley of ‘Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas’ and ‘White Christmas’. And his arrangements also find something new in such stalwarts as ‘We’ll Meet Again’ and ‘White Cliffs of Dover’, the female harmonies exquisitely done and as the beautiful Novello track ‘We’ll Gather Lilacs’ is added into the mix, only the hardest of hearts could remain unmelted.  By comparison, the book isn’t quite as strong, the shadow of Peter Nichols’ Privates on Parade looms large and Sincerely Yours’ chummy, feel-good spirit errs too close to contemporary attitudes than is perhaps strictly authentic, whether in the reaction to an unmarried woman’s pregnancy or the determination to live an openly homosexual life. Society was certainly changing due to the momentous upheaval of a second world war but it wasn’t moving quite that quickly."
869,869,Ought To Be Clowns,21/07/2012,Ian,The School of Night, Soho Theatre,"In advance of the start of the Edinburgh Festival, there have been many opportunities to sample some of the works going up there in venues across London, though the only one that I managed to fit into the schedule was The School of Night at the Soho Theatre. The main attraction was the fact that the company contained a number of the Showstoppers crew whose work I have enjoyed several times and so I was in no doubt of their improvisational skills. But where that previous show saw the team coming up with a musical on the spot, helped (or hindered) by audience suggestions, The School of Night sees them focusing on the world of literature, culminating in the creation of a uniquely special Shakespeare play that is shaped and guided by whatever the audience calls out. Starting off with some improv games based on the reading material of the audience and stories we were encouraged to share, the troupe immediately demonstrate their considerable gift of rapid-fire, quick-witted wordplay and repartee which soon had me howling with laughter. There’s something delightful in the sheer abandon with which the players create such imaginative worlds out of seemingly nothing and they obviously relish the freedom given to them in this opening section. The main part of the show, the creation of the Shakespeare play, whilst extremely funny in parts and always impressive, lacked something of this expressive joy. Part of it is due to the very nature of the Bard’s plays, there’s a limited canvas within which to work – things get silly of course but always remain in some kind of Shakespeare-related manner – and so the opportunity to improve wildly is curtailed. What we do get is something more cerebral, more intelligent in fact, as their innate understanding and exploration of Shakespearean linguistics and techniques comes to the fore and becomes the fodder from which they bounce off. This is undoubtedly impressive but not always as laugh-out-loud funny as it could be."
870,870,Ought To Be Clowns,01/02/2014,Ian,Carthage, Finborough,"Brutally effective, unerringly inquisitive, indisputably compelling. January may only just have finished but it is not hard to imagine that we won’t be talking about Chris Thompson’s Carthage when it comes to totting up the best new plays of the year come December. A debut piece of writing, Thompson has 12 years experience as a social worker and it is that which he has channelled into this play, which takes an unblinking look at the ruthless realities of the care system and whether it might indeed do as much damage as good.  The story centres on the case of Tommy Anderson – a young lad born in jail and fifteen years later, found dead in jail after officers tried to restrain him during a violent episode. Fragmented scenes skitter around this period trying to find the answers about who to blame and so Tommy’s mother, his social worker and his prison guard become the focus of the play – their actions (or inactions) exposed, their behaviours examined, their responsibilities explored. And born out of his hard-won experience, Thompson bravely holds back from offering any easy answers, or any definitive answers at all. He offers beautifully rounded characters, full of the complexities of real life and the complicated motivations of those trying to do a good job, even as they are failing. So Claire-Louise Cordwell’s gobby mother is the embodiment of terrible parenting but herself the product of an abusive home, and Lisa Palfrey’s social worker Sue has become so disillusioned at the impossibility of helping those who don’t want to be helped that she’s basically checked out. "
871,871,Ought To Be Clowns,13/10/2016,mag9l,BUZZ – A New Musical, Drayton Arms,"Who needs Olivier when you can have Eddie?! The latter may be a slightly lesser known award than the illustrious former, but it is arguably a more important one for upcoming talent. For The Eddies were conceived by Antonio Ferrera, Artistic Director of the Drayton Arms, for shows taking part in the Edinburgh Fringe with a top prize of a three week run to the West London venue. So congratulations to Fat Rascal Theatre whose BUZZ – A New Musical has just transferred in toto. And it’s not hard to see why it took the prize. From the moment you enter the theatre and interact with the two cave dwellers also waiting for the show to start, the attention to detail in this comedy really is beautifully thought through. From the blink-and-miss-em gags (I loved the nod to Avenue Q) to the fully realised randomness (the pink bodysuit – just genius!), the show really does pack in the jokes and crucially, doesn’t labour over them so that the running time simply flies by with real comic energy. Subtitled ‘A musical journey through the history of the vibrator’, Robyn Grant’s book interleaves the story of 20-something Angie, whose boyfriend has just dumped her, with historical anecdotes about the changing ways different societies have treated female sexuality. This it does with a marvellously rapid-fire quality – Cleopatra and her buzzing insect-filled gourd popping up over here, a Victorian doctor treating his patients for ‘hysteria’ tracking across the stage there – all the while, moving Angie closer to (re)discovering her sexual identity. And so it is supremely silly at times, and consistently funny, there’s actually something of substance here – ‘it’s funny cos it’s true’ – and that marriage of material and meaning is certainly to be commended. Despite this revue-style format though, James Ringer-Beck’s score errs on the musically cohesive side, rather than taking the opportunity to really mix things up. Consequently, there’s not necessarily a stand-out tune that you’ll leave humming; at the same time, it has a pleasing sense of its musical identity."
872,872,Ought To Be Clowns,25/11/2010,Ian,End of the Rainbow, Trafalgar Studios,"Following a run in Northampton earlier this year, Peter Quilter’s Judy Garland biographical musical drama End of the Rainbow is taking up residence at the Trafalgar Studios theatre, featuring a stellar performance from Tracie Bennett in the lead role. The play centres around the five-week period in 1968 when she undertook a cabaret season at the Talk of the Town in London in order to try and pay off the mountain of debt accumulated during a life of numerous marriages and divorces, repeated comebacks, drug dependency, ill health, suicide attempts and a whole lotta other drama too. This isn’t so much an impersonation of Judy Garland as an embodiment of her by Tracie Bennett, in what is a truly awe-inspiring performance. And it is testament to the depth of her skill that one isn’t longing for the next song to kick in as the acting scenes are just as strong and engaging as she battles with her constant need for reassurance, her fears of not being loved and ending up alone and the struggle to keep off the pills. This is clearly no hagiography as even though we get to see much of her waspish humour with some cracking one-liners, Garland is also shown at the depth of her desperation, begging to be given some of her ‘grown-up candy’, stumbling and cracking onstage during performances. Around her are those who would help her in their own way and though these are minor parts in comparison, they are valuable to the whole experience. Stephen Hagan takes on the role of Mickey Deans, her fifth husband who took on the role of manager too and tried to help her go cold turkey, with a marvellous hairpiece and array of polo-necks and a most handsome stage presence, as he tries to buck the trend with endless patience to keep Judy clean and sober but ultimately succumbing to the pressure. But it is Hilton McRae’s wryly affectionate gay pianist Anthony who captures a moment of gorgeous emotion as he applies make-up to his heroine’s face and then offers her a glimpse of an alternative life of domesticity in Brighton: the anguish on her face as she dismisses him for Mickey is just heartbreaking. Gareth Valentine leads the superb band who are intermittently revealed by William Dudley’s neatly designed set for the performance numbers of the standards such as ‘Just in Time’, ‘You Made Me Love You’ and ‘The Trolley Song’ and such was my enjoyment of the show that I totally forgave the rendition of ‘The Man That Got Away’ which was worked into the narrative, the only instance of this, rather than as a performance number. This was something which annoyed me hugely in Jersey Boys as the switch between the two modes happened so many times, but Bennett’s version of this Gershwin number, starting from a prone position is simply outstanding."
873,873,Ought To Be Clowns,13/04/2010,Ian,The Real Thing, Old Vic,"Set in London in the (early?) 80s, Henry is a successful playwright, married to his current leading lady but having an affair with another actress for whom he leaves his wife. He then ends up questioning whether this new marriage is indeed the ‘real thing’ but these issues extend to his professional life too as the question is continually posed about what is the most real, experiencing it for oneself or being able to write beautifully about it, even if it is happening to other people, ‘it’ ultimately being interchangeable for both art and love. It’s a bit tricksy in its format as one might expect from Mr Stoppard so you do need to pay attention from the outset. Toby Stephens’ egotistical playwright Henry is smug, overly pleased with himself and always ready with a bon mot instead of actually dealing with anything and so turned me off from the outset. I saw little of what was meant to be so appealing about him, the humour did not hit my buttons (although most of the rest of the audience had a good old hoot) and since he dominates this play, both physically and literally, there was never any danger of me coming round to liking it. A speech about writing being like a cricket bat nearly brought the house down but left me cold, and the sense of his journey to feeling real emotion coincided nicely with my personal journey to caring less and less about what happened to him. The delicious Hattie Morahan felt a bit miscast for me here as Annie (perhaps it was because I’m more used to seeing her in a bonnet) but she failed to convince as a temptress, devouring new men and experiences with gay abandon. Together I felt little of their chemistry either. I was disappointed to see so little of Barnaby Kay, having enjoyed his performance in A Streetcar Named Desire, but along with Fenella Woolgar as the other abandoned spouse, they both do well with very much secondary characters with limited roles, Woolgar actually managing to make her Charlotte (Henry’s first wife) more appealing than Annie! Tom Austen, Louise Calf and Jordan Young make up the cast in small cameos in the second act, but none are really given the chance to make much impact. In an ugly white letterbox set, with sections that slide up to reveal different configurations of doors, bookshelves and windows to denote separate locations, the eye is drawn to two brown armchairs around which the actors throw themselves. They never move, meaning I found the evocation of a train carriage to be rather clunky and the whole staging seemed to be quite wasteful of the opportunities offered by the large stage: it feels like too big a theatre to effectively capture the type of intimacy suggested by the set. The pumping music punctuating the scene changes and the vaguely 80s-inspired costuming did little for me either. I did not enter the Old Vic in a bad mood, but something about this play clearly struck a strong chord of dislike in me and I left feeling really quite bitter about a wasted evening in which I can honestly say I found no redeeming feature. There’s an awful lot of barefoot acting: I don’t know if this was significant but at least foot fetishists will enjoy it more than I did. I rather suspect I will be alone in this viewpoint, but the marital follies of a bunch of self-obsessed theatre types left me cold and The Real Thing is obviously not the play for me. Indeed, the only highlight was having Jamie Bamber and Benedict Cumberbatch in close proximity to me (although not together I might add). For God's sake, it was a preview! And? Whilst I should have mentioned it is still in previews (I normally do but mea culpa), I'm still a paying theatregoer and it should be noted that preview prices are a mere £2.50 (not even the cost of a programme) cheaper than normal. If you actually read the review though, most of the problems I had with the play will still be there once it opens: an ugly set that is ill-suited to the size of the venue and an unappealing (to me at least) set of characters.Funny how once again people don't complain of positive reviews in preview periods… Largely agree with your review – something cold about it, and somehow I felt Hattie was unconvincing both as seductive ingenue and as older woman, fascinating the lads. Henry I think we were meant not to care for. Henry is Stoppard, he has more or less confessed, and the author was getting things of his chest here, but also making himself more attractive in a sense by being rather harshly honest about himself. Stoppard is still one hell of a clever guy though – no denying. I actually think he's best on radio! Loved ""Travesties"" many years ago… he was such a ground breaker then! I agree with your review -saw this last Monday and both my companion and I hated it. The characters were smug and insular and the speechifying tedious. To borrow a quote from Frasier 'If I had an electron microscope I still would not have been able to find my interest' in what these characters were up to. I agree with your review totally.  What was the Guardian and Telegraph thinking?I saw it 7 years ago with Stephen Delane and Jenifer Ele.  It was moving.  They were open to each other and the chemistry was strong.  Their relationship became the 'real thing', a central theme in the play. It's a play about love and last night I saw not much that was 'loving'.  Actors, egos, an ugly clunky set and the most pretentious audience of 'in joke' laughter.  Possibly the worst theatre experience I've had in many years – worse because it had all the gloss and PR of something that should have been amazing."
874,874,Ought To Be Clowns,12/06/2005,Ian,Henry IV Part I, National Theatre,"The plays deal with the troubled reign of King Henry IV as he deals with rebellion and civil war, while his son and heir, Prince Hal, prefers to hang around East London with small-time criminals led by the aged, corpulent alcoholic Falstaff. They cover the whole breadth of English society at the time they were written, from aristocratic infighting right the way down to sleazy prostitution. It wasn’t particularly bad, but it just didn’t have the kind of quality of performance throughout the ensemble that I was expecting. The balance of the comic with the noble, which marks this play as rather unique in Shakespeare’s canon in that the comic content is unusually high for one of his Histories, needs to be carefully observed so that all aspects of the play work and I’m not sure that was achieved particularly well here. Michael Gambon’s Falstaff is wonderfully funny and strong, a huge stage presence but so much so that David Bradley’s King Henry is blown away: Bradley can’t really compete as he lacks the gravitas that the King ought to have. Likewise, Hotspur as played by David Harewood is such a physical presence that it is hard to imagine Matthew Macfadyen’s Prince Hal ever being able to beat him in combat as Hal’s journey from lad-about-town to potential King isn’t sufficiently developed, focusing too much on the drinking fun."
875,875,Ought To Be Clowns,22/09/2019,Ian,Call Me Fury, Hope Theatre,"In the space of just three shows, Out of the Forest Theatre have indisputably become a no-questions-asked do-what-you-can must-see company for me and so by extension, for you too. Bury The Hatchet (2018’s 7th best show as I’m sure you’ll recall) and On Your Head Be It whetted the appetite last year and now it is the turn of Call Me Fury to weave its theatrical magic at the Hope Theatre. Using the Salem Witch Trials as a jumping-off point, writer Sasha Wilson and director and collaborator Hannah Hauer-King attempt no less than a complete recasting of the history we think we know and the societal behaviours to which we’ve unflinchingly clung. The result is a bracing history lesson cum TED talk cum musical odyssey that gives an insistent voice to those whom historians have chosen not to record. 
I caught the show as a work-in-progress at the VAULT festival and it remains a powerful piece of theatre. Further devised with the company, which now includes Mairi Hawthorn, Gracie Lai and Olivia Kennett with Wilson, the fabric of Call Me Fury is a seamless blend between an exploration of the untold stories of the women of Salem and a set of case studies that span centuries as well as the globe in showing how far and deep notions of ‘witchcraft’ have pervaded.   It is at once more fun than that might suggest – wry humour is laced throughout and Wilson has a marvellous way with a dashing cape – but also deeply respectful with it, driven by a pulsing ache and desperate need to be heard. The score, with its snatches of folk and Americana, provides welcome emotional texture through its variety of stringed instruments (Hawthorne’s witty violin playing is particularly well done). And David Spence’s sparse, autumnal design sets the scene perfectly for this whirlwind of storytelling.  "

There Was No Man ought to have been the most powerfully resonant piece in the second part of the Tricycle’s The Bomb – a partial history given the heightened tension around the Iranian nuclear programme and the ever-present antagonism with Israel. The official blurb is as follows. ‘While Israel officially has no nuclear arms programme, few doubt it has; Iran claims this gives it the right to develop its own nuclear programme. Who will be the first to blink? When an Israeli and Iranian scientist meet at a conference in Jordan, their meeting has deep repercussions for their nations, their families and themselves.’ In the course of two meetings, one in Zurich in the aftermath of an assassination of an Iranian scientist and one in Tehran a few days before but immediately after, we get a taste of the intensely bitter and paranoid relationship between Israel and Iran and see just how far each is prepared to go in the face of their suspicions of the other."
879,879,Ought To Be Clowns,13/10/2014,Ian,Love’s Labour’s Lost, Royal Shakespeare Theatre,"A truly excellent comic actor, Bennett has the wonderful gift of always seeming on the verge of corpsing and for Berowne, it really works. The last to be co-opted into the King of Navarre’s aesthetic scheme of abstinence for him and three buddies, the first to point fingers when incriminating love poems start to appear once ladies arrive on the scene, Bennett shows us that this is a man well aware of the daftness of the enterprise he’s gotten swept up in. But he’s also an actor of much depth as he conveys the genuine sense of surprise that accompanies his own unexpected tumble head over heels and the crushing heartbreak of the play’s end. Sam Alexander’s Navarre and Leah Whitaker’s Princess of France also stand out as the games of courtship between the men and her visiting court grow ever more convoluted, the delight on Whitaker’s face in particular as the men essay a visually striking Russian dance is a sight to behold. John Hodgkinson’s Don Armado teases out an amusing line of humour in the comic subplot (for there must always be a comic subplot), ably supported by the sweet voice of Peter McGovern’s Moth though I don’t there’s anything anyone could do to make me like Costard (Nick Haverson trying his hardest here). Simon Higlett’s design makes great use of the RST’s capabilities to evoke distinctly different sections of the country pile that serves as the setting, the rooftop being a particular success, and the shebang trots along at a pretty pace, well under three hours. So a strong production full of likeable performances – Terry’s witty Rosalind is naturally up there too – and one which reaches its natural end with power and poignancy. There is then a coda woven into the play which, although it is undeniably extremely effective, left me a little ambivalent."
880,880,Ought To Be Clowns,16/12/2010,Ian,Sleeping Beauty, Richmond Theatre,"Richmond Theatre’s pantomime Sleeping Beauty was originally scheduled to feature Brian Blessed as a wicked wizard but he was forced to withdraw at late notice due to a health issue and fortunately long-time friend of the theatre Anita Dobson was able to fill in as the show was reworked to turn the wizard back into an evil fairy: the show must go on! It really is a mixed bag from top to bottom. Dobson is just brilliant as the wicked fairy Carabosse, displaying a terrifying amount of energy and a terrific pair of pins, with a performance which is certifiably bonkers and deliciously good fun as she works the audience expertly. And then there’s Tim Vine as court jester Jangles whose turn could have been lifted almost straight from one of his stand-up shows and herein lies its weakness. Whilst he is undeniably extremely funny (even if much of the audience were a little more equivocal), his constant patter of quick one-liners throughout the show didn’t always feel particularly well-integrated as he is most often playing Tim Vine rather than Jangles: a curious choice in this traditionally mounted family pantomime. This was simply exacerbated by the relative weakness of the script though with little real laughs coming from anywhere else with solid, rather than distinctive, performances being the order of the day from the cast. Musically, there’s some great use of Queen songs (I wonder how they got the rights for those…?!), Don’t Stop Me Now delivered by Dobson and the company is uniquely brilliant but too often, the production falls back on pop songs with a vaguely appropriate title with no concession to rewording lyrics to make them fit. And none of the original songs that appear on a regular basis really made much impact, no matter how well sung they were by the likes of Jon Robyns and Jodie-Lee Wilde. Fortunately things picked up considerably after the interval with an inspired take on ‘The Twelve Days of Christmas’ which finally connected perfectly with the audience as Vine and two of the male ensemble members ripped through a reworked version of the songs, with props, to hilarious effect. And with the audience visibly engaged, the cast relaxed into a much easier second half. But symptomatic of the whole production, the traditional sing-along and inviting kids from the audience onto the stage came right at the very end as an add-on rather than a part of the show and whilst Vine’s skewering of the typical employment of the fathers of these Richmond children was hysterical, it came dangerously close to leaving the kids bewildered. Ultimately there are things which will improve as the run progresses as Vine (hopefully) retargets some of his humour, Sophie Isaacs relaxes a little more into becoming a genuinely engaging princess and Fenton Gray could risk a broader, bawdier approach to his Nurse Penny. But I fear that the writing of this particular Sleeping Beauty is just too weak and too reliant on Vine’s own brand of humour for it to be a truly great show despite the sterling efforts of Anita Dobson. Perhaps I am being too harsh and over-analytical, but given the standard of other pantomimes in the London area with their lyrical invention and genuine warm humour, I could not help but be a little disappointed. “This is a no smirking venue.” 🙂"
881,881,Ought To Be Clowns,19/06/2012,Ian,The Prophet, Gate Theatre,"Vinegar, Pepsi and onions. The things one learns at the theatre are many and varied but having seen The Prophet at the Gate Theatre, I now know three ways to counteract the effects of tear gas. With the fresh turmoil of the Egyptian presidential election and a military -enforced constitutional crisis, Hassan Abdulrazzak’s new play arrives with impeccable timing. Set in the middle of the Arab Spring in a Cairo bubbling with possibility of significant change and all the danger it brought with it, he uses this as a backdrop to explore the lives of people living in the middle of it. Hisham and Layla have been married for seven years but things are going stale. He’s struggling with writer’s block but having his head turned by interest from glamorous Western literary agents; she’s an engineer, fending off her amorous boss even as she feels utterly neglected in the marital bed. Initially, the incipient revolution seems like an unwanted distraction from their comfortable liberal lives but as it awakens Layla’s nascent political activism and Hashim’s imagination flips into fevered overdrive, their own well-buried secrets threaten as seismic a change as the overthrow of the Mubarak regime.      The pulsing heart of this play, directed with searing precision by Christopher Haydon, lies in its documentary roots; its evocations of a pivotal, possibly epic moment in Egyptian society as based on extensive interviews with all levels of Egyptian society. In a simply stunning piece of writing at the mid-point, Layla describes her journey into the middle of the protests at Tahrir Square – the unexpected camaraderie with people of all classes, the terror of the police turning against their own people, the simultaneous fear and exhilaration of being in the middle of it all. Sasha Behar delivers this with an excoriating directness and fierce passion that is simply breathtaking to watch and by any rights ought to be recognised come the end of the year. That this scene, and the others like it, resonates with such an obvious truth poses less of a problem than one might have assumed, given Abdulrazzak’s vivid construction of Hashim’s guilty conscience which offers a sound counterpoint to the brutal reality going on around him, something highlighted by the atmospheric use of video footage across Holly Pigott’s sand-hued set. The only real weakness for me came in some rather clunkily unbelievable dialogue for Layla’s boss, some modern film referencing that just fell flat.   Behar is excellent throughout and as for the rest of the cast, Nitzan Sharron exudes a deeply sexy Mark Ruffalo-esque affability as blocked writer Hisham, Melanie Jessop swishes effectively as Suzanne, the femme fatale literary agent whose agenda runs deeper and Silas Carson manfully handles the doubling of Layla’s boss Hani and Suzanne’s work-proud colleague Metwali. There’s a credibility throughout here that does the playwright proud, the sense of bitter realism never far from the surface. As Layla says, ‘you have a certain image of yourself, the things you wouldn’t do. But then life puts that image to the test and you find yourself wanting.’ Abdulrazzak wisely resists the temptation to recast the Arab Spring with a rose-tinted hue in favour of representing the reality of living through it."
882,882,Ought To Be Clowns,14/08/2017,Ian,Dangling, Southwark Playhouse,"Telling the contrasting but complementary stories of two young women who have gone missing – one from t’north, one from the capital – Abigail Hood’s Dangling is a brutal, at times harrowing play to watch. The London-based strand is the stronger. Not-quite-16-year-old Carly’s disappearance has left a huge hole in her parents’ lives and Hood explores the myriad ways this impacts on them with a real questioning intelligence. In a devastating scene, Tracey Wilkinson’s Jane finds herself driven to entertain thoughts of the worst kind about her husband and the fact is that Jasper Jacob’s Greg does have touches of a moral queasiness about him.  He’s paying young women to dress up as his daughter and roleplay conversations with him, and he’s under investigation at the school where he teaches for potentially inappropriate conduct with female pupils. He’s also distraught about his inability to look after his child, haunted by dreams of her in some painfully authentic writing. Wilkinson and Jacob are superb together and those notes of ambiguity from the latter are beautifully effective, especially in his scenes with Hood’s Charlotte – the lookalike – who has her own emotional issues with which to deal. Over in Oldham, things are considerably more grim as we visit a scenario in which reasons why someone might choose to go missing are explored. Also on the edge of 16, Kate’s experience of family life has been very unsettled and the announcement that her father is getting early release from prison is a shock. It sends her big brother off to a new life in Brighton with promises that he’ll come back for her but even in that short time, horror strikes. The threads of domestic abuse and mental illness that come through are weighty indeed, perhaps too much so for the limited time here, and scenes of pyschosexual torture are gut-wrenchingly difficult to bear, as they rightly should be (achingly good work from Charlotte Brook as Kate). Dramatically speaking though, they feel harder to justify, not least for their jarring effect. The play is on far surer ground in sketching the quiet devastation of those left waiting, like Philip D McQuillan’s Danny, the brother returned too late, never better than in the subtle sledgehammer of the final scene.  Kevin Tomlinson’s production is strikingly designed – an array of significant objets hang from the ceiling, a sad reminder of all we leave behind – and inventive use of benches in an otherwise bare room is creatively inspiring (even if a couple of the scene changes end up a little too long for the actual scenes they set up). Overall, Hood’s writing is most effective when it steers away from the melodramatic and it is scorchingly powerful when it does. "

884,884,Ought To Be Clowns,01/11/2014,Ian,The Wolf at the Door, Royal Court,"And to be honest, I have to say it would have been no great loss had I missed it. Mullarkey posits a world in which the middle classes are a seething mass of discontent and an aristocrat is spearheading a movement for radical change that taps right into it, cue beheadings in Tesco, marauding morris dancers and a fully armed WI. An arresting concept but one which increasingly reveals itself to have little to say, a particularly disappointing ending the cherry on this barely-risen cake."
885,885,Ought To Be Clowns,11/01/2012,Ian,Huis Clos, Donmar Warehouse at Trafalgar Studios 2,"Some things will never change, one of them being my complete lack of ability to say ‘no thanks’ when offered a free theatre ticket, no matter how much I know I will not like the show. Jean-Paul Sartre’s Huis Clos did not hold much interest for me when initially announced and as it apparently sold out very quickly, it seemed done and dusted. But circumstances prevailed upon me to be a plus one for a colleague and so off we went to the Trafalgar Studios studio space. Huis Clos forms the final part of the Donmar Warehouse’s Resident Associate Director scheme and Paul Hart is the director being given the opportunity to showcase his talents here. Unfortunately for me, the play he chose was this ‘existentialist masterpiece’, written in 1944 and clearly a heavy influence on Samuel Beckett. I don’t ‘get’ Beckett, I’ve yet to really enjoy one of his plays or really understand what place he is coming from, that connection has never materialised for me. And so it was with Huis Clos: Sartre creates a hell of our own making in which three protagonists are trapped in an intolerable (or is it…) waiting game. As one would expect from these productions, the casting is fairly top-notch. Michelle Fairley, Fiona Glascott and Will Keen play the three people escorted into this windowless room, by Thomas Padden’s grim valet, and they soon come to realise that they are in fact dead, in hell and carefully selected to drive each other crazy. Eventually we come to discover the crimes they committed to end up here rather than in Heaven but I have to say, I had long stopped caring about any of it at that point. The dull, meandering play shredded my patience, the heat of the theatre tried its damnedest to lull me to sleep (only the fear of being seen snoozing by more people than usual stopped me – this is in-the-round by the way) and had there been an interval, I can safely say I wouldn’t have returned."
886,886,Ought To Be Clowns,15/01/2007,Ian,Thérèse Raquin, National Theatre,"Maybe it was a consequence of not knowing the novel rather than it being a weakness of the play, but I didn’t like the fact that we entered the story at the mid-point, so that the love triangle had already mostly played out with Thérèse already tumbled for Laurent and Grivet cuckolded. I wanted to see more of this build-up to get a better sense of the characters and their motivations: as it was, I didn’t really believe in the erotic drive between the lovers, nor saw the side to the husband that forced such a dark decision as the one they carried out. Having to accept all this as a fait accompli and making the focus of the play the moral reaction to their dastardly deed felt slightly skewiff to me and this I didn’t much care for it, or them. Patrick Kennedy as the husband was probably too good in this respect and though I quite liked Ben Daniels’ smooth Laurent, I never warmed to Charlotte Emmerson’s portrayal of Thérèse or understood why I should care about her dilemma. I can see the story working better on the page as too much of the story felt like it was about what was going on inside their heads. Ironically, Judy Parfitt’s bitter stroke-ridden mother-in-law was my favourite acting performance of the night with barely saying a word in the second half."
887,887,Ought To Be Clowns,29/12/2011,Ian,Goldfinger, Radio 4,"The narration made it seem really rather old-fashioned, a very traditional way of telling a story and that is how it came across, as a story rather than a play, a piece of drama. It felt rather flat and lacked excitement, despite the quality of the cast, but I think it also suffered a bit by comparison. No sound effect could ever replicate the visual of Oddjob’s deadly bowler hat (yet simultaneously, without that visual it would barely have any impact, a whooshing sound alone inspires little), likewise John Standing’s M’s gagdetry, and the constantly changing locations, within a short space of time, do not really lend themselves to effective drama – explanations needed too often."
888,888,Ought To Be Clowns,07/03/2012,Ian,Purge, Arcola,"Despite the riches on offer on the multitude of stages across London, contemporary European theatre is something that is all too rarely seen here. But theatres like East London’s Arcola and companies like Borealis (who mounted 8 Women at the Southwark Playhouse last year) are trying to redress that balance and have most definitely come up trumps with this excoriating piece of drama. Written by Finnish-Estonian Sofi Oksanen and latterly adapted into a hugely successful novel, Purge has an epic scope – weaving together the stories of two women, Aliide and Zara, with the troubled history of post-WWII Estonia and the struggles and compromises made by a people living under occupation. It is rarely easy viewing, violence is presented matter-of-factly and none of these unpalatable truths are sugar-coated. Zara is a prostitute who has murdered her pimp and is on the run from gangsters, the much older Aliide is living in seclusion out in rural Estonia trying to keep the past at bay and reluctantly offers the younger woman sanctuary. And as they gingerly step around each other and slowly reveal their hidden stories – the focus being on Aliide’s extraordinary history – the ramifications of their decisions become clearer as the realisation of a strange connection comes hand in hand with a real danger knocking at the door. Through Eva Buchwald’s translation, Oksanen expertly manages to create a thriller that plays out with heart-racing tension in both the current day and in Aliide’s recollections of her past, also contrasting and comparing the experience of the two women. Under Soviet rule, Aliide chose marriage to a Communist apparatchik against the revolutionary nature of her family and ended up complicit in working against them, whilst simultaneously hiding her brother-in-law from the authorities. Her resulting shame at being a collaborator placed side by side with Zara’s equal shame of being recognised for the pornographic films she was coerced into. And the violence, often sexual, that is perpetrated against them seeps into their nature as neither shies away from moments of eye-watering aggression in order to get closer to the truths that they need. Elgiva Fields’ production brilliantly captures the oppressive air of Oksanen’s story in the intimacy of the Arcola’s second studio, Joshua Pharo’s dank lighting of Rosemary Flegg’s spare design working well as the story tightens its grip on the audience, the unflinching brutality of its revelations all the more powerful for being so very close to us. Illona Linthwaite is astonishing as the older Aliide, gruff and abrasive but powerfully persuasive in her self-justifications, and I loved the choice to keep her onstage for much of the reminiscences, this is a woman who owns her memories no matter how difficult they are. Rebecca Todd as the younger version possesses much of the straightforwardness we come to see from Linthwaite and the grim determination to do what must be done, as she sees it, especially where the concealment of Hans, whom she truly loves, is concerned. The men do well here: Kris Gummerus’ Hans is a tall drink of Nordic water but is quietly extremely moving; Johnny Vivash’s middle-ranking Communist official is horribly credible as a man blithely adopting the new status quo in order to get along regardless of its true nature; and Benjamin Way as the brash hoodlum Pasha has a powerful physicality which exudes cocky danger. But this is about the women, and what beautifully realised, complexly drawn and utterly believable characters they are. Concepts of fractured identity, though perfectly situated here in the travails of twentieth century Estonia, echo across gender and nationality. And with Elicia Day as a scrappy Zara, Todd and the outstanding Linthwaite demand our attention from the off and reward it with a play of extraordinary depth and clarity: highly recommended."
889,889,Ought To Be Clowns,08/11/2012,Ian,People, National Theatre,"Were I watching Alan Bennett’s new play People at home on DVD, I would probably make it a drinking game, with a shot to be taken every time the title appears. Except it wouldn’t last very long at all, no matter how strong your liver, as it is repeated, repeated and repeated in this lament for the fading fortunes of the English aristocracy. Dorothy Stacpoole, a former model who now lives a semi-reclusive life with her companion Iris, is being forced to decide the fate of her near-decrepit South Yorkshire stately home: should some of the contents be sold on to private investors, who are also interested in buying the whole house, or should it be given to the National Trust, who Bennett has decided to take aim at with this piece of writing. In an incredibly slow-moving opening 30 minutes or so, it becomes apparent that Dorothy – Frances De La Tour oozing hauteur – favours the former option, whilst her Archdeacon sister June is determined that it should be the latter. Bennett rails against the commodification of history and the creation of ‘experiences’ but curiously he makes Dorothy the mouthpiece with her fears of having people traipsing through her home and disrupting her life. Quite why we’re expected to feel sympathy for this poor little (formerly) rich girl whose inability to take responsibility has left the house, and her life, in the state it is in, I’m not sure. As the middle classes are berated for their greedy invasiveness, the upper classes get something of a free pass as it is the National Trust who are derided for imposing a new form of feudalism, an argument that left me a little baffled as I’m not 100% sure, but I don’t think Trust membership is mandatory – so if it bothers that much, just don’t join up. Bennett also moves around other areas with very mixed results. The issue of women in the clergy is carelessly bandied about and discarded with no little pithiness and the dip into pseudo-Carry On… territory as a porn film crew take up residence is breathtaking and not in a good way. Depictions of gay men and Eastern Europeans are appallingly misjudged (but sadly rapturously received), credulity stretched ridiculously to get a laugh from the predictable arrival of a bishop, it is an altogether most odd moment. And there’s also a sense of the kitchen sink being thrown at the production as we approach the end, both from Bennett and Hytner. Barely needed plot revelations tumble out, crowding the culmination of the story unnecessarily, and the addition of a random interpretative dance routine detracts from the transformation of Bob Crowley’s dilapidated set into something worth visiting. The lurches into grandiose speechifying disrupt the flow of the play, lending a portentous quality that lacks subtlety and sympathy and unfortunately reminds one of the stultifying earlier moments. But it is also the physical context in which one sees a show that characterises one’s response. For example, I have my difficulties with farces, which are almost always exacerbated by feeling completely alienated from an audience that starts laughing hysterically from the first pratfall. And so too with Bennett plays, there’s usually a feeling that the audience is determined to laugh at every single thing, regardless of what is actually being said. Thus loud laughter accompanies the phrase ‘you’re one of those nancies’, somebody honked loudly at the reference to ‘the death of Diana’ and some people, including the woman behind me, tittered inanely at what felt like every third word throughout the entire play, even in the more reflective moments."

891,891,Ought To Be Clowns,10/02/2018,Ian,The Moor, Old Red Lion,"The Old Red Lion may not look like the most flexible of spaces, especially since the seating is not, but it seems to inspire designers to come up with most inventive work. And Holly Pigott is no exception as she evokes the dark and brooding mystery of an unforgiving moorland, enhanced by the striking lighting design from Jamie Platt. And it provides an ideal setting for the psychological thriller that is Catherine Lucie’s The Moor. Bronagh has lived there for most of her life but is far from immune from the strangeness that the landscape inspires. Trapped in a fug of post-natal depression, grief from the death of her mother and the torment of an abusive relationship, she’s beginning question what is real. Which as an abstract concept doesn’t sound quite so bad. But after a night out full of arguments with boyfriend Graeme and the subsequent disappearance of a young man who was at the same party, her shakiness with the truth becomes highly significant as she fingers her partner as a person of interest in the case. How reliable are her memories? No-one is sure. There are moments when it seems like that might include Lucie, the slipperiness of the storytelling and all its unreliableness doesn’t always feel completely under control. But Blythe Stewart’s production is strongly acted, particularly bu Jill McAusland’s complex Bronagh and Oliver Britten’s vicious Graeme."
892,892,Ought To Be Clowns,02/07/2012,Ian,A Doll’s House, Young Vic,"There are occasions when I wonder if the madness will ever stop. In my determination to be as open-minded as theatre as I can, I frequently put myself through things that I know I don’t like in the hope that something new might appear to me. This is particularly true of Ibsen, the Norwegian playwright acclaimed as one of the greatest playwrights ever but through whose work I have suffered a lot as it just hasn’t connected with me. Some productions have come a little way but by and large, I just don’t like Ibsen. Yet when the Young Vic announced a new production of A Doll’s House, directed by former AD of the Gate Carrie Cracknell and newly adapted by Simon Stephens, my reflex booking finger got to work to revisit this shocking-at-the-time tale of the pursuit of self-realisation with its forward-thinking deconstruction of 19th century marriage as Nora and Torvald Helmer are rocked by a series of events that rips down their perceived notions of each other. This was a preview that I saw, so be sure to take everything I say with a pinch of salt. And boy am I glad that I did as from the second row, I found it be utterly, hypnotically compelling. I’ve previously tended to find Ibsen’s characters extremely remote and hard to access but from the outset here, there’s a persuasive sense of a realistic dynamic in the marital relationship of the Helmers. Returning from her Christmas shopping trip, Nora’s image remains beautifully composed (Gabrielle Dalton’s costumes are simply gorgeous) and her position as the ultimate trophy wife soon apparent as her husband emerges from his study. What Dominic Rowan does so very brilliantly is to convey all the brutal complexity of Torvald, there’s a seductive quality, a sexually possessive masculinity that one can imagine any of us, never mind Nora, falling for, even as he seeks to control her.  But as the play progresses, Rowan increasingly darkens in tone, and manner, as his attentions become creepier, more stifling as his true attitudes are laid bare. All the while though he maintains that veneer of magnetic affability that he can switch on, even in his drunken mocking of his wife’s friend Kristine, he is disarming and charming. Against this barrage of testosterone, Hattie Morahan’s Nora is initially completely in thrall. Fluttering around like the countless birds to which she is compared, she fusses and fixes, ever playing the dutiful friend and wife and prone to burying her face in her husband’s chest as the consequences of her previous actions threatens to paralyse her. But there’s also an intensity that burns inside of her, that Morahan brings so powerfully first to her face as the devious Krogstad makes his pernicious demands of her, and then to her whole body as she practices her tarantella dancing with such fierceness it is as a seizure has taken over her entire person, so desperate is she to erase the horror that has become her life. And then the final scene of epic self-realisation, there are barely words to describe the incandescence with which she burns, streams of understanding uncoiling from her and solidifying into determined action, it is devastating and exculpatory and wrenching and extraordinary and most importantly, it resonates with profound truth. Ian MacNeil’s design mounts the Helmers’ apartment onto a revolve, its four rooms and interconnected corridors spinning round in a number of tableaux which cover the scene changes. They appear frequently and unquestionably add to the running time which might make them less than popular but I thought they were excellent, they bring a real sense of the domestic bustle that forms the backdrop to the play and accompanied by Stuart Earl’s plangent music, it provides some piercing moments like Nora gazing through the living room window at her children with a baleful ambivalence. Those children feature quite a bit, which really adds depth to the portrayal of Nora’s life and what she stands to lose (though I didn’t find out which pair of boys was on for this performance) and in the only slightly indulgent, if ineffably cute moment of the production for me, a baby is actually used to briefly play the youngest child. But elsewhere in the supporting performances – Steve Toussaint’s ailing doctor, Susannah Wise’s desperate widow, Nick Fletcher’s weaselly Krogstad – there’s such clarity and emotional honesty that the pace of the play and its strong currents of feeling never falter.    Though I did see Zinnie Harris’ version for the Donmar back in 2009, I can’t pretend to know enough detail of the play, or have enough of a sense of Stephens as a writer, to be able to comment on his version here, I will leave that to more seasoned commentators. What I can say though is that between them, Stephens and Cracknell have cracked the shell of emotional reticence that often marks Ibsen’s plays and revealed its beating heart, the powerful emotion that lies at the heart of such extreme emotion. It is the first time anyone has ever managed this for me with Ibsen and so with my hand on my heart, I can say this was a genuinely revelatory production.   I saw it on opening night and was blown away by it, even though I too have ""problems"" with Ibsen.   I did wonder why the Torvald's apartment had an electric light switch in the living room and a modern electric bedside lamp, given that the action is set in 1896.  And I also wondered why Hattie Morahan, after having acted her butt off for over two hours, was not given a solo bow at the end.  She surely deserves one. I have to say I didn't notice the anachronisms – funny how little things like that can stick out for some people and not others, I guess I'm just not that familiar with the history of lighting, hehe.As for the curtain call, I guess its about showing a company feel, though I agree, Morahan deserves her own."
893,893,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2015,mag9l,The Sweethearts, Finborough,"Enrique Iglesias said that he could be your hero, Mariah Carey reckons there’s a hero inside of you, Bonnie Tyler’s just holding out but Sarah Page is more interested in asking questions about what makes a hero in this day and age and just how fallible they are. This she does in unexpected ways in The Sweethearts, a play first seen at the Finborough as part of their new writing festival Vibrant last year, and now receiving a full run directed by Daniel Burgess. Set in the boiling heat of Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, a tent that is usually used as an office has been converted into sleeping quarters in advance of the visit of girl group The Sweethearts, out doing their bit for the troops and naturally being filmed by a TV crew for the publicity. But when the base comes under heavy fire, the pop stars are trapped with the soldiers assigned to look after them and their differences make an already volatile situation that much more explosive. Page clearly has an ear for comic dialogue and she sets up these two groups brilliantly in her opening two scenes. The roughhousing banter between the soldiers about calling shotgun on the band member they fancy the most is deepened by the passing references to the families they’ve left behind, their exploits in combat and their unflagging loyalty to their CO. And flagging in the oppressive heat, there’s much fun to be had as the singers prepare for their gig but even there, the sacrifices for their level of celebrity are proving harder to bear. And once the two groups are thrust together, the tone darkens considerably as their priorities clash and their vastly different life experiences are thrown into stark relief. The divisive final scene pushes this to the extreme as the impact of life on the front-line is exposed in all its shocking ugliness, the uncompromising directness deliberately tough to take. It’s a sharp swerve but one which demonstrates the vicious unpredictability of PTSD, captured eloquently in Stevie Raine’s performance and made all the more distressing for the eye-winking charm he’s displayed up to that point."

895,895,Ought To Be Clowns,28/10/2012,Ian,Charley’s Aunt, Menier Chocolate Factory,"Between balancing requests for reviews and selecting what other plays I want to actually see, it is a rare occasion that I actually attend the theatre as someone else’s guest for a show of their own choosing. But in order to see an old university friend and Dominic Tighe (only one of these was actually sat next to me though), my Sunday afternoon was spent at the Menier Chocolate Factory to see the Victorian farce Charley’s Aunt. It is little secret that I am no great fan of a farce, though I have been trying my best to being open to having my mind changed, but this isn’t the one to force a reappraisal of the genre. It is what it is, a cross-dressing, slapstick-filled riot of an occasion – revived here by Ian Talbot – which sets its stall out from the very beginning with a character mugging for laughs. And laughs aplenty he got, if not necessarily from me, in this tale of three Oxford university student toffs determined not to let anything get in the way of their amorous plans. But when Jack and Charley’s chances look like being scuppered by the non-arrival of chaperone Donna Lucia, the titular elderly aunt, they prevail upon their friend Fanny Babs (Sir Fancourt Babbeley natch) to impersonate her to ensure the romancing can take place. Predictably, this leads to capers and misunderstandings as the mistaken identity crisis comes to a head with the entrance of the real Donna Lucia.  Paul Farnsworth’s design is deliciously lavish for such a venue, especially as it changes, but Talbot’s production is rather straightforward elsewhere, an uncomplicated rendition of this heightened fare centred on a man in a dress. Mat Horne is that man, and plays it well for laughs, especially when fighting off the attentions of the older gentlemen in the group. Tighe and Benjamin Askew as the upper class twits ensure we’re laughing at rather than with them (even when the writing doesn’t always seem that way) and Jane Asher is good fun, though under-used, as the genuine aunt."
896,896,Ought To Be Clowns,27/02/2012,Ian,Sondheim’s Company in the cinema,,"I have to admit I was initially a little wary about going to see this: my relationship with Sondheim took a bit of a battering in the deluge of productions that celebrated his anniversary year and it was only really with the utterly fabulous Sheffield Crucible production of Company at the end of last year that the pieces all finally clicked together for me and I could hand on heart for the first time say that I absolutely loved a Sondheim show. But I have gotten much better at managing expectations for shows, especially in relation to other productions of the same, and this was an opportunity to see a whole bunch of performers, whom I like but may never get to see, live on a big screen. And you’ll get the chance when the show screens for one night only on Thursday 15th March at 7pm – the list of cinemas is available here. Staged by the New York Philharmonic and conducted by long time Sondheim performer Paul Gemignani, my heart sank a little as the camera revealed a long thin stage in front of the orchestra in the Avery Fisher Hall and it looked as if we were in for a concert version of the show (I hadn’t read anything about the show beforehand). Whereas it was a treat to see the 1995 Donmar Warehouse cast reunited in their recent concert reprisal, I didn’t think the staging really did the show many favours at all, but fortunately it soon became apparent that whilst not a full production, a simple set of sofas on wheels would provide an endlessly entertaining flexibility in portraying a range of NY loft apartments, balconies, bars and bedrooms. Plus a smidgen of engaging witty choreography sprinkled around the place under Lonny Price’s direction, the stage was indeed set for a most enjoyable night at the movies. Through George Furth’s book and Stephen Sondheim’s music and lyrics, Company focuses around the 35th birthday of Bobby, a singleton in a sea of married people who are surprising their eternal bachelor friends with a party. But where Bobby sees five visions of married bliss in his friends, in a series of vignettes we see something closer to the truth in the difficulty of maintaining marital harmony as Bobby eventually gets to a place of major self-realisation. I’d wager that it is one of Sondheim’s strongest scores with so many excellent songs, but the show’s success does rely on the casting of Bobby and in Neil Patrick Harris, they’re pretty much onto a winner here. He doesn’t quite have the full belt to deliver the show-stoppers but what he does possess in bucket-loads is the kind of twinkle-eyed charisma and warm humour that completely convinces as a guy who can juggle three women at the same time as well as inspiring the kind of deep friendships in both women and men that sometimes blurs into something more. Patti LuPone was exactly how I expected (and dreamed) she would be, just simply terrific as the cocktail-wielding Joanne, frequently stealing the show with her acerbic wit and pointed delivery – ‘The Ladies Who Lunch’ has rarely looked or sounded so good. But there really was so much to appreciate across the supporting cast which contained a number of (barely recognisable to me) celebrity names from things I don’t watch like Christina Hendricks (Mad Men), Jon Cryer (Two and a Half Men) and Stephen Colbert (The Colbert Report), but more importantly also featured a wealth of established Broadway talent. So whereas Hendricks actually did impress as the ditzy flight attendant April and Colbert isn’t half bad as he leads ‘Sorry/Grateful’, they are significantly bolstered by their colleagues, amongst whom Martha Plimpton’s gorgeously warm and hilariously karate-chopping Sarah really impressed as did Katie Finneran’s 100 word-a-minute Amy delivering ‘Getting Married Today’ with great skill, Chryssie Whitehead showing off some great moves and Aaron Lazar being just smoking hot as Paul."
897,897,Ought To Be Clowns,26/01/2019,Ian,Open, VAULT Festival,"A real sense of genuine feeling ripples all the way through Open. Husbands in real life, co-stars on this stage, Christopher Adams and Timothy Allsop’s play explores their nine year relationship and the ways in which it has evolved from meeting on Guardian Soulmates through civil partnership to marriage, accompanied by their decision to be open to sleeping with other men. Statistics are tossed out – apparently 40% of gay couples are in open relationships – but what makes Open work is the specificity of the story being told here. This is no advertorial for all gay men to sleep around, but rather Chris and Tim’s deeply personal history being laid out, a bracingly frank investigation into the reasons for their choices and exactly how it made them feel. So it is admissions like being able to be sexually adventurous in a different way with others and how small jealousies still chip away at them that ring true, even with a web of rules to try and define how far they’re willing to go. And it is refreshing to see such a subject treated without any of the lurid sensationalism that plagues too many a gay play (they’ve even got their shirts on in the poster image!)."
898,898,Ought To Be Clowns,18/09/2013,Ian,Votes for Women/The Magnificent Andrea, Radio 3/4,"Part of a series of radio dramas looking at contemporary responses to the increasing emancipation of women at the turn of the twentieth century, Votes for Women is a 1907 suffragette play by Elizabeth Robins, one of the most forthright actresses of the time who allegedly pulled a gun on George Bernard Shaw when he made a pass at her. Her play looks at women who were equally bold at a time when the movement for women’s suffrage was beginning to stagnate, paralysed by the filibustering efforts of the men in Parliament. Where some were content to continue the same path and attempt to win them over, others were adamant that direct action was the only course of action and Robins neatly explores this schism in the movement. In Marion Nancarrow’s production, Zoë Tapper plays Vida Levering, one of the activists determined to take things further whose zeal sweeps up those around her, including the youthful heiress Jean Dunbarton, voiced by the delicately effervescent Charity Wakefield, who is newly engaged to Sam West’s Tory MP Geoffrey Stoner, who in turn has his own connection to Vida. This tangled relationship provides the melodramatic meat for the final third of the play and if not quite brilliant, it is certainly engaging. Robins is much more successful at the dramatisation of the crusading spirit and enthusiasm of the time. The marvellous Sylvestra Le Touzel plays Lady John, one of the more seasoned campaigners and her conversations with Tapper’s Levering are excellently done, positing both sides of the debate but purely through their conversation rather than heavy-handed posturing. And where there is soapboxing, it is entirely appropriate as at the rally that forms the middle of the play which is vivid and compelling and extraordinary and shocking. Somehow the debate still seems so relevant, many of its issues still not satisfactorily resolved in our modern society (such as, rather amusingly, the havering of the Liberal party) yet Robins is always canny enough to force us to take our own positions, and ask ourselves the question of how far we would go to fight for them."
899,899,Ought To Be Clowns,22/12/2012,Ian,Irving Berlin’s White Christmas, Lowry,"My last show before Christmas was a festive trip to the Lowry which maintained a long-running family tradition of being treated to a show by Aunty Jean just before the big day. This year saw us take in Irving Berlin’s White Christmas which has returned to the Lowry after a highly successful run a couple of years ago. I would have loved to have seen original stars Aled Jones and Adam Cooper return too, but this still made an engaging, if undemanding, frolic through the snow. Based on the 1954 film starring Bing Crosby, it has one of those plots it is best not to think about too much. Its premise is quite a sweet one: two ex-servicemen form a musical double act and as they find themselves chasing romance with a pair of singing sisters, end up in the Vermont hotel that belongs to their former Commanding Officer and whose future is in doubt due to a lack of snow. The only way to save the day is to…you’ve guessed it, put on a show! So the excuse is provided to put on big production numbers throughout the show and with songs like Blue Skies, Happy Holiday and Sisters, it is worth it. David Morgan’s production has a slick quality about it which always looks top quality, especially with Randy Skinner’s choreography. The act 2 opener is as brilliant a piece of dance theatre as I’ve seen all year and is expertly delivered by a committed ensemble and led by Louise Bowden and Paul Robinson who are both charming as the second lead couple. Their romance is actually more engaging than the main one. Steven Houghton dances excellently as leading man Bob Wallace and sings powerfully, though I would have preferred a little more subtlety in his voice. But there’s nothing he can do about Claire Sweeney as his partner Betty, whose movement across the stage felt laboured (even though she has little choreo to deliver) and whose voice never feels at ease with the material (even as she overeggs the diva posturing). The unlikeable showgirl persona she is working lacks any of the necessary charm to make us care about this central romance and so she was ultimately quite disappointing for me. But there’s plenty else to enjoy: Ken Kercheval (who was in Dallas apparently) grizzles wonderfully as the retired general and speaks most movingly when addressing the soldiers under him, Wendi Peters explodes with charismatic verve as the hotel’s concierge Martha and frequently steals the scenes she is in – Sweeney could look to Peters’ delivery of Let Me Sing And I’m Happy for a proper Broadway feel, and if Anna Louizos’ set can feel a little laboured in its constant blackouts for the scene changes, the range of locations she comes up with makes it worthwhile."
900,900,Ought To Be Clowns,30/10/2012,Ian,Top Hat, Aldwych,"On the face of it, Top Hat should have been a rip-roaring extravaganza of a show that tapped and waltzed and strutted its way right into my affections, featuring some of my favourite things like a healthy selection of classic songs from the Irving Berlin back catalogue and the kind of choreography from Bill Deamer that genuinely makes me wonder if it isn’t too late to find my inner Billy Elliot (don’t worry, I know it is…). But at this Tuesday matinée, I found it was particularly topping to be there and I was sadly left a little underwhelmed by the whole shebang. It seems perverse to comment on the plot of a musical being far-fetched, especially one based on an old-school Broadway film as this is, but the book here – adapted by director Matthew White and Howard Jacques – is criminally lame. The story is a whole lot of silliness, which is fine – girl complains about guy dancing in the room above her, guy flirts with girl, girl gets cold feet when she think s guy is married to her best friend. Oh, and the guy is a leading Broadway star about to open a show. Where the problem lies is in the incredibly dated humour, which one can just about explain away as a period piece, but which just sags and droops with lame joke after overblown stereotype which was lapped up all too easily by this audience, of whom I was the youngest member by quite some margin.  This all meant that I was basically holding my breath waiting for the next dance number to start. And they are mightily impressive – led by Tom Chambers, who is perfectly charming as the guy, and Summer Strallen, who has a lovely warm sense of humour to accompany her graceful dancing as the girl – the big production numbers look fantastic, especially in Hildegard Bechtler’s art deco sets. But even here, there’s not really enough chemistry between them to pull us into their story, and the relentlessly chirpy nature of proceedings veers a little too close to schmaltz on occasion, mainly because I can’t hear the lyrics of ‘Let’s Face The Music and Dance’ without tearing up."

902,902,Ought To Be Clowns,16/02/2015,mag9l,A View From The Bridge, Wyndhams,"What more is there to say about a play that was my undoubted favourite production of 2014 (out of more than 380 lest you forget!) and which did more than I could have possibly imagined to finally introduce the spectacular creative force of Ivo van Hove to a wider audience. Not much as it turns out! The Young Vic’s extraordinarily successful A View From The Bridge has now transferred into the West End, setting up shop in the relative intimacy of the Wyndham’s and remains one of the most highly recommended shows that I could urge you to go and see.  My original review is here and I stand by everything in it, van Hove’s recasting of Arthur Miller’s classic still burns with its unstoppable, slow-building tragic force and even in this larger space, maintains the same level of punishing emotion. I hadn’t intended to revisit in all honesty, having seen the original run twice but the announcement of onstage seating – to replicate something of the feel of Jan Versweyveld’s original staging – hooked me back in. When the pricing was finally announced, I balked but the simultaneous release of a new date, complete with tickets for the front row of the balcony (one of the best West End bargains for my money), meant I was helpless to resist. Third time around, I enjoyed seeing it from a new angle – straight on this time, and it really struck me how precisely van Hove positions his actors on the stage, no matter how involved in the scene they are. There’s always something being said about the inter-relationships between the characters as you notice who they’re facing, who they’re closest to, who they’ve turned their back on… And creatively, Versweyveld’s lighting and Tom Gibbons’ sound swell magnificently to fill the larger space, I really didn’t feel like we missed anything from our seat in the gods. "
903,903,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2020,Ian,Overheard, Chinese Arts Now at Wun’s Tea Room & Bar,"The illicit pleasure of listening in on the conversations around you is one which never grows old and it is one that the Chinese Arts Now Festival seems keen to encourage. 2018 saw a production of Ming Ho’s Citizens of Nowhere? which gave us headphones to eavesdrop on a family reunion in the lobby of the Southbank Centre and using similar technology, you can now experience Joel Tan’s Overheard at Wun’s Tea Room & Bar. At a time when the term immersive is abused so freely when describing theatre, it is a lovely surprise when a production actually gets it this right. Wun’s Tea Room remains open to customers while the show is happening so there’s a real sense of hustle and bustle around you as the wait staff slip between the tables of this atmospheric cocktail bar and restaurant (you can add food and drink to your ticket – I’d recommend the loquat and plum wine cocktail and chilli sesame dumplings!).  And as you slip your headphones on, you clock that you can hear some women talking, just sat on that table over there, and so the world of Overheard truly begins. It actually takes the form of three short plays, reflecting the breadth of what Tan’s writing is trying achieve, in representing the enormity and diversity in what we might too easily just term ‘Chinese’. And directed by Mingyu Lin, it offers up much food for thought (if not the Iberico char siu).  From the Hong Kong protests to caring for your elders, second-generation imposter syndrome to straight up xenophobia, this triptych covers a huge amount of ground as it explores just how divergent being Chinese can be. From Beijingers to Singaporeans, artists to businesswomen, Tan probes intelligently at the complexity of these inter-relationships and the varying power balances that they inhabit, the preconceptions that underlie them too."
904,904,Ought To Be Clowns,01/02/2019,Ian,The Ruffian on the Stair, Hope Theatre,"Having just seen Pinter’s first play The Room as part of Pinter Five, it’s impossible not to think that Joe Orton had seen it just as recently when he started writing The Ruffian on the Stair, a 1964 radio play later retooled for the stage. But even as similarities spring forth in the opening half, the overriding sense becomes one of a playwright finding his own voice. Joyce and Mike live a precarious existence in their rundown bedsit – her recently off the game, him on the dole, the true circumstances of their relationship never fully spelled out. Their lives are thrown into disarray when a knock at the door heralds the arrival of Wilson, a smartly dressed young man initially enquiring after a room but once he’s over the threshold, revealing far more sinister intent. His arrival is a shot in the arm to the play, but also to Paul Clayton’s production. In the claustrophobic surroundings of Rachael Ryan’s period-detailed design, Lucy Benjamin and Gary Webster haver a little as Joyce and Mike, only truly relaxing into the Ortonesque black humour once Adam Buchanan’s creepily effective Wilson is there for them to bounce off."
905,905,Ought To Be Clowns,16/10/2014,Ian,Barnum, New Wimbledon,"Mark Bramble’s book has showman PT Barnum following his dreams to put on the world’s first travelling circus but little dramatic impetus to form a more interesting narrative journey. And Cy Coleman’s score with Michael Stewart’s lyrics has some pleasant enough songs in it – ‘Come Follow The Band’ and ‘There’s A Sucker Born Every Minute’ – but it also has a lot of filler; for such an ambitious show, it is a rather bland musical experience. Fortunately it is also blessed with some game-changing visuals and Andrew Wright’s peerless (certainly for his generation) choreographic gifts. The spell is begun to be cast with the 10 minutes or so of pre-show entertainment which is most definitely unmissable and throughout the show, Wright combines gymnastics and acrobatics (check out Landi Oshinowo, wow!) with dance in a seamless blend that elevates the scale of the whole show – knowing that the next ingenious circus trick (Juliette Hardy-Donaldson’s work as circus consultant is very well judged) is just around the corner is more than enough to get you through any of the drearier numbers, no matter how well played they are by the hard-working band under Ian Townsend’s musical direction."
906,906,Ought To Be Clowns,22/03/2014,mag9l,Molly Wobbly, Phoenix Artists Club,"Molly Wobbly’s Tit Factory was originally scheduled to receive a full production at the Hackney Empire last year but a last minute financial crisis saw it cancelled. Now trimmed down to Molly Wobbly and slimmed down to a staged concert, it has resurfaced at the Phoenix Artists Club, with some of the cast returning together with some newcomers, to give Paul Boyd’s musical another chance at airing in London. And it has to be said that the intimate venue feels a much better fit than the Empire would ever have been. The show clearly has visions of cult status, its bizarrely eccentric book incorporating boob jokes aplenty, cross-dressing angels and tales of sexual deviancy alongside the marital trials of three couples who live on Mammary Lane whose lives are changed with the arrival of a mysterious lime-green-haired stranger bearing a vial of orange potion. And Boyd’s score is an eclectic mixture of standard musical theatre tropes, gothic fairytale and something close to melodic pop. ‘Designed by Margaret Brown’ is an 11 o’clock number to rival any other, the theme that heralds mysterious goings-on evokes Tim Burton’s work, and ‘Suddenly at All’ sounds like it could be an ABBA b-side. Much of it is highly tuneful but the breadth of its variety means that show never quite achieves a coherent identity. The performance choices also span a wide range, almost always raising a smile but never quite gelling. In the intimacy of the Phoenix Artists Club and in the staged concert format, it never really feels like too much of a problem. But on a wider stage, it is hard to see how the full gamut from Alastair Brookshaw’s taciturn Malcolm to Jordan Lee Davies’ overdone Kitten would have worked effectively."
907,907,Ought To Be Clowns,14/10/2012,Ian,The President and the Pakistani, Waterloo East,"Layers upon layers: can we ever get to know the truth about the private lives of our public figures? In his own 1995 memoir Dreams From My Father, Barack Obama changed names and conflated people to both protect people and to create more narrative flow, thus creating his own version of events from his life. And in The President and the Pakistani, Evening Standard journalist Rashid Razaq has now written his own fictionalised account of one of those crucial junctures in the life of POTUS in The President and the Pakistani to further obfuscate the picture whilst simultaneously providing a rather intriguing piece of drama. In 1985 when Barack was still Barry, he was shacked up in Harlem and living a relatively normal life. But having decided to take a job in Chicago, that would mark the beginning of a meteoric political ascension, he has to say goodbye to his old life, including his roommate, an illegal Pakistani immigrant called Sal Maqbool (who is neither Obama’s fictional Sadiq, or real-life’s Sohale Siddiqi, and yet he is both). Over the course of a long night, Obama has to break the news to Sal – who thinks they’re just packing to move flat – that their journeys are about to take wildly different turns. It’s one of the strange quirks of life that communal living can bring together the most diverse of people, folk who would never normally give each other the time of day suddenly find themselves in each other’s pockets. And so it is here: Syrus Lowe’s Barry is a fast-maturing twenty-something, hints of the man behind the façade peek through as he bops away to hip-hop and boxes up a pleasingly assorted reading list, but there’s also a suggestion already of the steeliness necessary to survive political life; and Junaid Faiz’s Sal is the victim of that cool realism, his drug-fueled self-destructive impulses completely incompatible with the sought-after entrée into public life. Occasionally, Razaq teeters over into a heavy-handed foreshadowing of Barry’s future role, the speechifying and the willingness to make harsh choices for the greater good spelled out a little too obviously, though it is interesting to wonder how much of the politician was in Obama’s character before he moved to Chicago. And Tom Attenborough’s forthright direction keeps matters uncomplicated in the intimate space of the Waterloo East – attractively adorned by Francesca Reidy’s set – as we wind to the conclusion that we know is coming."

909,909,Ought To Be Clowns,24/09/2015,mag9l,Nell Gwynn, Shakespeare’s Globe,"As a director, Jessica Swale has proved herself one of the finest at reinvigorating Restoration comedies and as a writer, has demonstrated a clear interest in illuminating tales of historical women so it is only right that her latest play for the Globe combines these two worlds in a heady rush of delightfully comic theatre. Directed by Christopher Luscombe, Nell Gwynn brings to life an ultimate rags-to-riches tale of an East End orange-seller who became a long-time mistress to King Charles II, also finding the time to become the most famous actress of the era along the way, a vital and vibrant part of theatre history.  The Globe proves itself to be an ideal venue for a show about the theatre and from the moment Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s wonderfully self-possessed Gwynn first calls out from the audience in amongst the groundlings, we’re just as smitten with her as Jay Taylor’s Charles Hart, the leading man du jour who sweeps her under his wing from where she blossoms into the leading performer of their company, ruffling a fair few feathers along the way, especially once she attracts royal attention and discovers matters of heart are also now matters of geopolitics in one of the play’s most striking and amusing scenes.  She’s not just a funny writer though, Swale’s a clever writer too. So alongside gags about playwrights stealing their inspiration (from Shakespeare to Titanic…), there’s also wry digs at the lack of decent leading roles for women (‘twas ever thus) and pointed commentary about the importance of theatre in an enlightened society and our collective duty to support and protect it where necessary. She also weaves in tiny moments of real pathos – Charles’ memory of his father’s execution, Queen Catherine’s treatment in court, the entreaties of a sister left behind (gorgeous work from Anneika Rose). But above all, it is just one of the funniest plays in London right now, and possibly of the year so far. Amanda Lawrence delivers the kind of scene-stealing delight as dresser (and reluctant sometime actor) Nancy that ought to be studied by all acting students as a masterclass in comic acting whether from the delivery of a single line or grand physical comedy – she is hilariously fantastic. David Sturzaker is as appealing as his spaniel (not a euphemism) as the mischievous monarch and Greg Haiste’s bristling Edward Kynaston is huge fun as the actor who used to star in all the female roles."
910,910,Ought To Be Clowns,03/08/2017,Ian,Evita, Phoenix,"As the ‘new’ is ushered out of the Phoenix, set to tour the UK from next summer, there’s a return to the tried and tested, the old if you will, as Evita returns to the West End. Bill Kenwright and Bob Thompson’s production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s slice of Argentinian politics has been touring on and off for nearly 10 years now and it was actually in London at the Dominion just a couple of years ago. So in some ways it can be a little hard to get too excited by the reappearance of such a stalwart, especially when there isn’t the presence of someone like Elena Roger to truly electrify the show as she did in the 2006 revival. That’s not to detract from Emma Hatton’s stirring performance here – subtle and characterful, always searching for the meaning rather than the big belt in this notoriously tricky of roles to sing. It’s more that Evita can’t really hold (m)any surprises. As a pseudo-biographical work, it doesn’t lend itself to any kind of interpretation, nor is there much innovation at hand (that said, Matthew Wright’s set is cleverly conceived). And it is such a presence in the collective consciousness that you can’t imagine this being the show that converts anyone to the myriad charms of musical theatre – most everyone already knows how they feel about it."

I knew I didn’t really want to see Travesties so I didn’t go to the Menier but sure enough, it transferred into the West End to test my resistance further and I crumbled."
913,913,Ought To Be Clowns,02/04/2016,mag9l,Hedda Gabler, Salisbury Playhouse,"Brian Friel’s translation of Hedda Gabler was first seen at the Old Vic in 2012 when Sheridan Smith took on the lead role but Anna Mackmin’s production struggled somewhat with the humour that the Irish playwright introduced. A few years later though, Gareth Machin takes the same adaptation for his Salisbury Playhouse with greater success, finding an ideal balance of tragicomedy that might not always feel entirely Ibsenesque but remains convincing nonetheless. Matters are also helped by casting the excellent Kirsty Bushell as Hedda, present on the not-inconsiderable list of actresses I really rate but well worthy of the place. With a whip-smart wit that lacerates too easily (her husband’s ageing aunt and their servant bear the brunt of this) and a sensuality that she deploys on seemingly every man but the one she’s wed to, Bushell gives us a real woman with a real sense of all the capricious vivacity that she believes will no longer be a part of her humdrum married life. James Button’s design further plays into her despondency. The walls of the townhouse into which they decamp after their honeymoon are made of a near-opaque gauze which highlights the oppressive lack of privacy she feels but also exposes her every emotion, the withering contempt for her husband’s fussing (an excellent Ben Caplan) or the shuddering desolation at the realisation of what her life has and will become. It’s a testing role but Bushell really delivers."
914,914,Ought To Be Clowns,21/06/2014,mag9l,Midsummer Mischief A, The Other Place,"Four playwrights have been asked to respond to the provocation “well behaved women seldom make history” and in the first double bill, Timberlake Wertenbaker’s The Ant and the Cicada and Alice Birch’s Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again take on the challenge. First things first, The Other Place has been reconstructed on the stage of the Courtyard theatre with some unforgiving, and unforgivable seating. I mean it is hard-going to say the least and put me in mind of the body-destroying experience of sitting in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. It is not good. But back to the theatre. Wertenbaker’s Greek-set drama strains a little hard to incorporate its multitudinous themes and explore them sufficiently. I’d put this up for elimination no doubt. But Alice Birch’s piece sparkles with much more eleganza, extravaganza and revolutionary spirit in a fiercely argued set of scenes which look at where feminism is and where it might end up. It represents. It has all the charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent that you could hope for and feels much more successful than the recent Blurred Lines in evoking the urgency of the debate. "
915,915,Ought To Be Clowns,20/04/2010,Ian,Ruined, Almeida,"Working in partnership with Amnesty International, the Almeida theatre gives us the European premiere of Ruined, the Pulitzer Prize winning play from Lynn Nottage. It is set at Mama Nadi’s, a bar and brothel in a small mining town in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mama runs her bar with a rod of iron, serving anyone who will pay, no matter what side they are fighting for, along as they leave their weapons and their politics at the bar. As the civil war encroaches ever nearer and two new arrivals who have suffered particularly badly at the hands of soldiers, she is forced to reassess her life of providing women and whiskey without question and decide if it is enough. As Mama Nadi, Jenny Jules is excellent. She’s rarely off-stage and holds the whole play together with her irrepressible hostessing, able to charm any customer yet possessed of an indomitable spirit, no soldier, no matter how threatening, gets past her with a weapon and she rules over her girls with a rod of iron. Starting off like Brecht’s Mother Courage, a similar profiteer from wartime chaos, her motivations remain mostly ambiguous but as events catch up with her, she becomes much more emotionally engaged. Jules is supported extremely well by Pippa Bennett-Warner as Sophie, bright and beautiful yet ‘ruined’ by a bayonet, Michelle Asante as Salima, gang-raped by soldiers but then even more painfully, shunned by her husband and Kehinde Fadipe as Josephine, the most sexually confident of the three but just as damaged. Together, they form an uncompromising group of women, scarred both inside and out by rebel soldiers, government soldiers, even their own families, and only able to dream of what might be in the (relative) safety of each other’s company. The staging is really atmospheric, the recreation of the African jungle with seemingly huge depth is highly effective and Mama’s shack, perched on a revolve is also impressively mounted. One side is consistently dressed as the bar whilst the other alternates between the exterior of the bar and the bedroom of one of the girls. The speed with which these changes are smoothly executed is astonishing and the stagehands ought to be congratulated, it is most impressive. Far be it from me to disagree with Pulitzer Prize judges, but I did find the writing veered uncomfortably towards the clunky. With performances of such rawness and honesty, overly melodramatic lines like “you’re the first girl bold enough to steal from me” and “men will no longer fight wars on my body” stuck out like sore thumbs, leaving one wishing Ms Nottage had stuck closer to the testimonies of the Congolese women she interviewed in writing this piece. And the second half is a little too full of statements of position at the expense of the genuinely engaging ensemble scenes we’ve witnessed earlier on. And I just felt the whole thing could have been edited down into a much tighter entity: the subplot about the rough diamond added very little, the singing in the bar scenes went on for far too long, considering very little actually happened in them, even Salima’s powerful account of her truly harrowing experiences begins to lose its impact as it is overextended. Personally I was not a fan of the final scene, I found its revelations unsurprising as they had been clunkily telegraphed earlier on and slightly annoyed by its need to explain Mama’s motivations, her morally ambiguous tone (which I was happy with as it was to be honest) and the way it resolves things, given the attitude to men displayed throughout the rest of the play. Still, this is an important piece of drama, giving voice to those who are most affected by endless, senseless conflict but yet who are most often ignored, and is a testament to the endurance of their human spirit that forces life to continue and be bearable in the face of terrible circumstances. Well-acted, thought-provoking (I still can’t decide how I feel about being sold to a brothel being the best possible life for women) and genuinely engaging, Ruined is not without its faults, but this is highly recommended theatre. Amazing staging for sure, great acting showcasing lots of new black talent as well as the more established  names such as Jenny Jules who should win awards for this. We need the ending to remind us of hope and balance the events of the previous scene."
916,916,Ought To Be Clowns,08/01/2016,mag9l,P’yongyang, Finborough,"You know how it is, you wait for a play about North Korea and two come along at once. But where Mia Ching’s You For Me For You used an absurdist approach to explore the impact of the Kim regime on individuals (and by extension, whole swathes of its population), In-Sook Chappell uses the frame of a classic thwarted love story, stretching over nearly three decades, to examine what life might be like in the harsh realities of the Communist state in P’yongyang. When we first meet them, Anna Leong Brophy’s Yeon Eun Mi and Chris Lew Kum Hoi’s Park Chi Soo are schoolmates with a shared passion for cinema and soon enough, each other. They both dream of attending prestigious film classes in the capital P’yongyang but the revelation that Chi Soo’s father was born in the South demarcates him as lower-born in the strict rules of their society and thus their lives are set on radically different paths. Thus Chappell depicts Eun Mi’s ‘rise’ to the status of Kim Jong-Il’s favourite, himself a cinephile who adopts the sleazy alias of ‘The Producer’ to give his own special acting classes. And we see how Chi Soo becomes trapped in the vicious grip of absolute poverty with his parents, director Chelsea Walker switching back and forth from these different forms of suffering with real pace and an assured touch which means the drama never becomes too oppressive. Flashes of wry humour puncture the gloom and there’s an interesting acknowledgment of the theatricality of the way North Koreans are forced to live their lives, as Eun Mi and Chi Soo cross each other’s’ paths time and again. Leong Brophy and Kum Hoi connect beautifully as the young lovers and both track the weariness of experience well in later scenes, sterling support comes from Lourdes Faberes and Daniel York who both cover multiple roles."
917,917,Ought To Be Clowns,29/10/2016,mag9l,This Little Life Of Mine, Park,"The clunkiness of the above rhyming couplet is a little symptomatic of This Little Life Of Mine, a well-meaning but mis-intentioned new musical receiving its premiere here at the Park. Written and directed by Michael Yale and scored by Charlie Round-Turner, it follows the regular lives of regular London couple Izzy and Jonesy and that really is just about it. Self-described as a “musical drama”, there’s a singular lack of the latter here which means that the show just ends up dull. Finding the magic in the mundane is the stock in trade of many an insightful piece of writing but ultimately, all This Little Life… manages to do is extract the ordinary out of the extraordinary. Yes, there’s chuckles to be had in recognising some of the more exasperating aspects of modern life in the capital, extortionate house prices and needlessly expansive coffee menus to name just a couple, but a show that aims to show just how regular life can be needs to aim higher than replicating said regularness (regularity doesn’t seem right there…)."
918,918,Ought To Be Clowns,15/04/2012,Ian,Black Battles with Dogs, Southwark Playhouse,"Set in a white-run construction site in an unidentified African country, Bernard-Marie Koltès’ Black Battles With Dogs is the latest show to move into the second space at the Southwark Playhouse. The throaty ululations of unseen native security guards (unconfirmed reports indicate the yodelling Floyd Collins may still be trapped in the Vault – after all, did we actually see his body…) calling out to each other to keep awake over a long, long night which sees Alboury, a local man, demanding the return of the body of his brother who died that day, apparently in the compound. The weary Horn is coming to the end of his shift working for this company, he’s physically scarred and emotionally drawn, tired, grumpy and sick of this existence. But it turns out his junior colleague nervy, prejudiced Cal is the one who shot a man and disposed of him nearby and Horn is thrust into the middle of the situation to smooth it out. Matters are further complicated by the arrival of Parisienne Leonie, eminently unsuited to the area but with her eye on marrying Horn for his money. Thus the scene is set, but little really plays out from it in the end. So much is said in this play, but so little of it makes any impact, it’s like white noise. The writing veers between the humdrum and the would-be profound, exacerbated by a rather clunky translation from David Bradby and Maria M Delgado – find me a Frenchman who has ever referred to the ‘South of France…’ – which ends up being painfully dull. The whole thing yearns for a profundity that never comes, the writing never hits the metaphorical depths it is aiming for (as a colleague pointed out, a huge list of things it is ‘not’ are listed in the programme – the list of things that it is is conspicuous in its absence) but it is not aided by a literal-minded production that locates it firmly in the real world dealing with real problems. Thus the performances are also caught in this tension. Paul Hamilton struggles as Horn, lumbered with much of the portentous speech which rarely sounds like anything anyone has ever said in real life. Arkley’s viciously racist Cal is loud and extremely physical but rather unconnected to what’s going on around him as if perhaps over-compensating for a lack of substance. And Rebecca Smith-Williams has no chance at all with the appallingly drawn barely-there character of Leonie: that Osi Okerafor’s Alboury spends most of his time with her trying to sell a burgeoning relationship is a shame as it is thoroughly incomprehensible and unbelievable. There’s also the question of the oft-times unforgiving second space at the Southwark Playhouse. Some of the productions in the Vault have been able to utilise its idiosyncrasies most effectively, but trying to evoke the stifling heat of an African evening whilst it is so cold one can see one’s breath is perhaps a step too far. The design here uses shadowy darkness well to suggest the unknown terrain outwith the compound, but it stretches out a little too wide deep into the railway arches where it might more effectively be hemmed in claustrophobically – not enough happens to really justify the extension of the playing area so far and I do think it would have suited a more tightly defined space much better."

920,920,Ought To Be Clowns,29/08/2017,Ian,Apologia, Trafalgar Studios,"It is tempting to think that this revival of Alexi Kaye Campbell’s 2009 play Apologia was mooted simply so that the above line could get the laughs it richly deserves for its prescience. As it is, Jamie Lloyd has fashioned it into the vehicle that has tempted Stockard Channing back into the West End for the first time in 25 years or so (although she did make it to the Almeida in for Clifford Odets’ Awake and Sing).  Perhaps the word should be refashioned, as the play has been subtly adapted to make its central character an American (I find myself entirely intrigued about the process of this happening – rewrites over accents) but what a character she is. Kristin Miller is celebrating both the publication of a memoir about her career as an eminent art historian and her birthday but gathering folk around the dinner table proves far from a game of happy families. For her book fails to mention either of her sons, Peter and Simon, and a life of pioneering political activism has created a marvellously fearsome persona. It is her sons’ partners – a soap actress and a Christian – who initially attract her derision, with the kind of withering put-downs any Dowager would pay good money for. But we soon discover the deep-lying cracks that stem from her losing custody of the boys at a young age. Channing delivers Kristin’s ferociousness perfectly. Whip-sharp lines are underscored with scathing stares and so she enlivens the overused trope of the dinner party no end (qv Dessert most recently). Freema Agyeman does her best with the relatively thankless part of the actress Claire but Laura Carmichael is a real stand-out as Trudi, initially seeming little more than a whipping-dog for Kristin, we gradually see her get the measure of her host without ever losing respect for her. For as monstrous as she might seem, there’s empathy for this woman too, a deep understanding of the losses and sacrifices she has endured, the full acceptance of which she is still coming to terms with. We see this most affectingly in her interaction with younger son Simon, in the form of a piercingly good monologue from Joseph Millson (who actually doubles as both sons) even if there’s something a touch underexplored in the choices Kristin made at this crucial juncture in everyone’s life."
921,921,Ought To Be Clowns,06/03/2020,Ian,Heroine, VAULT Festival,"Enrique Iglesias could be one for you, Mariah Carey thinks you are one; and so did David Bowie. Popular culture lacks no paeans for heroes but when it comes to celebrating heroines, the well seems to run a little dry (and no, it’s not just because it is a more difficult rhyme…!) Snatchback and Joyous Gard’s Heroine looks to redress that balance just a little as it delves into folkloric traditions from around the globe to celebrate the unsung. Written by Lizzie Milton (10) and directed by Asia Osborne (Call Me Fury and The Teind), the show puts its women front and centre as we meet Mother, Maid and Crone who are here to take us on a storytelling odyssey. And as we journey from West African tales to Aztec traditions, from Celtic mysteries to Inuit romance, there’s a funny and frank appraisal of role of women in these stories and what they often have to endure in the name of the patriarchy.  The man who is surprised that his Selkie wife isn’t in love with him after a decade of captivity, the kings who send girls over the bridge of a single hair, the fathers who push their daughters off cliffs or betroth them to cannibalistic suitors… Fairytales have always been dark but Milton makes you really pay attention, not just to the indignities but also to the immense fortitude present. None of these women are about to give up, even if they’re anchored to the bottom of the sea.  "
922,922,Ought To Be Clowns,13/10/2010,Ian,Legally Blonde – The Musical, Savoy Theatre,"I have tickets for Legally Blonde – The Musical later this month after the cast change as the final part of my trip round the musicals, but when a friend offered me a last second ticket on a cold dark night, I thought why not and decided to give this show another whirl. A more detailed review of the show can be found here, this will focus more on the performances this time round. The cast is largely the same, Richard Fleeshman being the only major change having taken over from Duncan James, but I saw Andy Mace as Professor Callaghan, on for an indisposed Peter Davison. This really is Sheridan Smith’s show: her energy and vivacity drive proceedings on so effortlessly and naturally and she really is a gifted comic performer, getting the laughs in throughout, but also finding real emotional depth too. There was some unfortunate unscripted drama as she injured her shoulder (apparently nothing serious and not a dislocation as someone reported on Twitter) midway through the first half and the lights came back up as we anxiously waited to find out what would happen. She eventually resurfaced and continued bravely though in some discomfort, perversely lending the finale of Act I a real gritty, tear-jerking quality. An extended interval led us to suspect an understudy would appear, but to her credit, Smith finished the show and her second half performance showed no sign of the injury. I applaud her for continuing on and not wanting to disappoint her audience (who reciprocated with a raucous standing ovation) but I do worry about the physical toll this role is taking on her body, especially as she has now extended to January: it really is a demanding part, Elle is rarely off the stage and sings in the vast majority of the songs. I’m not sure if Alex Gaumond was having an off night, but I was surprisingly unimpressed this time round, especially with his earlier vocal performances which all felt slightly off and always struggling to keep in tune, he didn’t seem comfortable all night. Shaven-headed Mace did well as Callaghan, coming across as a sexier, gay version of Davison but I struggled to like Fleeshman’s Warner, miscast against Smith as he looks too young, vocally he sounds nice but too full of pop stylings which obfuscated his lyrics, little attempt at acting and subsequently, there was no real element of musical theatre in his performance. It was nice to see Jill Halfpenny again after being somewhat disappointed in her recent cabaret turn, and seeing her obvious chemistry with Chris Ellis-Stanton more clearly this time round; and the Greek chorus of Delta Nu girls Amy Lennox, Susan McFadden and Ibinabo Jack always provide great interest whenever they’re on stage. I adored this show when I first saw it, which I think was a little bit of an overstatement on second viewing. The show opens strongly with two of its best tunes, but after that there is too much blandness in the music until we finally hit the first, tearful rendition of Legally Blonde (which in its brief duet version is the best bit of the show I think) that there’s anything hummable. There’s lots of great comedy in-between to be sure and it still rates as a great night out, just not the unqualified success I convinced myself it was last time round."
923,923,Ought To Be Clowns,25/04/2013,Ian,Geek! A New Musical, Tristan Bates,"I cannot lie to you, when I came out of Geek! A New Musical at the Tristan Bates, I thought (and tweeted) that it was one of the most puerile and offensively bad shows I had seen in quite some time. A few days distance has mellowed that viewpoint a little, but mainly to replace indignation with frustration at the choices in both play and production. Writer Scott Morgan has put together a pretty bog-standard American high school drama – when Queen Bee Flissy Joy has her plans to win the school beauty pageant derailed by Daddy cutting her off, she and her clique of plastics turn to new girl plain Jane to makeover her into a prize-winning stooge and catch the eye of handsome jock Billy-Bob into the bargain. But it is such a saturated genre that every plot point, twist and gag can be traced back to Glee, Cruel Intentions, She’s All That, Mean Girls, etc etc… and with little sense that anything new has been added here. Musically, Morgan’s score is functional rather than distinguished, Benjamin Holder’s over-amplified musical direction far too heavy on the drums (on this night at least) though it is sung proficiently. But dramatically, it suffers from trying to be too clever in self-referencing as a pastiche of both the high school genre (‘don’t run down the corridor, douchebag’) and of musical theatre itself (‘”where were you?” just singing a song outside…’), without having the requisite sharp-edged wit or dramatic chops to carry it off throughout the whole show. Perhaps to overcompensate for this, directors Porl Matthews (who also designs) and Jamie Chapman Dixon throw everything, the kitchen sink AND the blow-up doll at the show with a key note of the lewder and cruder the better which batters away with an unrelenting persistence which may well be to your tastes. It wasn’t to mine. To say that former Egghead and producer of the show CJ de Mooi’s lascivious schoolteacher is overacted would be to understate the scene-chewing and word-mangling extravagance at hand here but there’s not enough control to really hit the comic beats full on and so it too often feels indulgent. Likewise, Mark Parton’s choreography is certainly ambitious but frequently misguidedly so – the opening sequence is way too hectic for such a small space which is a real shame as it means that the impressive acrobatics don’t get the attention they deserve and the arrival of three shirtless Spanish señors as flamenco-flavoured back-up for a song about a would-be lothario is somewhat baffling as I am pretty sure that Casanova was Italian…  Matthews’ set manages to make Acorn Antiques look solidly constructed with its wobbly walls and shaky segments but instead of making a virtue of its naffness, the cast are forced to blithely continue as if all is going fine. Which makes for the occasional laughs as performers try to squeeze through ever-narrowing gaps to move from scene to scene, but also actively works against the production as two rare moments of relative stillness are completely hijacked by the painfully jerky revolve of a piece of the set- perversely it’s one of the funniest things to happen on the stage but comes at the expense of the hard work of the performers. And they do work hard – in the ensemble, Harry Cooper-Millar’s boy-fancying jock and Ciaran O’Driscoll’s doubling as a nerd and a goth stood out for me. But the uncertainty in the writing proves a stumbling block elsewhere: Lea Marinelli’s queen bitch Flissy Joy gets a stirring anthem to sing at a moment of personal crisis but it’s not immediately clear what its message is or how tongue-in-cheek she is being about having the chance to start again. And Anna Haresnape’s new girl Jane is given very little to work with given that it is her character’s journey, such as it is, that forms the main thrust of the show and its ultimate destination (insofar as the person she becomes) strikes a bum note. This conflict between whether this is a send-up of the genre or an active part of it is what hobbles the show. I can hear the argument ‘you shouldn’t take it so seriously’ but the business of making people laugh is a serious one, it requires attention to detail and consistency. Instead we end up with an unevenness about what is being lampooned, a parade of lewd sex gags and a barrage of swear words in place of actual humour or satirical commentary and it just becomes wearing. "
924,924,Ought To Be Clowns,02/03/2010,Ian,Disconnect, Royal Court,"Currently playing upstairs at the Royal Court is Disconnect by Anupama Chandrasekhar. It follows a team of 3 call centre operatives in Chennai, India as they chase debtors in Illinois, USA in the vain hope of meeting their sky-high targets. They take on American identities to try and collect credit card payments from unwilling debtors, but harassed by their new supervisor, himself suffering from a demotion, they are forced to play more by the rules, resulting in poorer performances, in turn forcing severe consequences for the team. It’s clever, fast-paced, comic and very much of our time. It juxtaposes the role played by the developing world in picking up the pieces of the global recession, of course mainly caused by the Western world, with the continued aspiration for this way of life, despite it being exposed as unsustainable on a constant basis with every call that is made. But it is also an office drama, and its strength lie here in the depictions of the highly-competitive, target-driven environment in which camaraderies are forged and dreams chased.
Making his stage debut here as Ross, who is at the centre of the play, is Nikesh Patel in what is a stunningly accomplished performance. He oozes a cocky charm tinged with the desperation of wanting to be part of a world that is so close and yet so far, and the ease with which he flitted between very convincing American and Indian accents left me clueless as to what his real voice must sound like. Ayesha Dharker is touchingly moving as Vidya, epitomising the cultural conflict inherent in their work and I also enjoyed Neet Mohan’s puppyish Giri. Hasina Haque is under-utilised as the more senior Jyothi, displaying some great comic timing in the delivery of her lines in the opening scene, and I would have loved to have seen more of her. The set is a harshly lit, stuffy, windowless room papered with bills and overdue notices, which constricted the action somewhat. I didn’t mind it during the play itself, but the endless reconfiguration of the desks which marked the scene changes did begin to irk me. And whilst the overlapping dialogue scenes were extremely impressive, there were times when it was hard to decide who to follow and it was hard to shake the feeling that I was occasionally missing things as people laughed around me and one particularly tragic event passed me by almost entirely until its conclusion."
925,925,Ought To Be Clowns,11/07/2015,mag9l,Rhythm of Life, St James,"A week bookended by cabaret turns from Debbie Kurup can be no bad thing indeed and whilst we covered the catalogue of Kander + Ebb earlier in the week, it’s now the turn of Cy Coleman to get the tribute treatment with Rhythm of Life, the world premiere of a revue which has the added bonus of 5 never-performed-in-London-before songs from the Cy Coleman archive. Joining Kurup was Marti Webb, John Barr and Cedric Neal with musical director Michael Webborn leading them from his piano. And when focused on the music, this is some enchanted evening indeed (to borrow a phrase). Coleman’s compositions include such classics as Sweet Charity, On The Twentieth Century and City of Angels (recently seen at the Donmar Warehouse), I can’t honestly include Barnum in that number… Lesser known works also shine in this format, the best songs cherry-picked from shows like The Life and Seesaw, demonstrating the wide range of collaborators with whom he worked across his career. And whether a much-welcomed Marti Webb driving through ‘Nobody Does It Like Me’, Kurup’s dryly comic romp through ‘The Oldest Profession’, Barr ingeniously flipping the script on ‘Never Met A Man I Didn’t Like’ or Neal’s impassioned ‘Use What You Got’, even the not-so-familiar songs sounded great here, more than matching the expected brilliance of Kurup nailing ‘Big Spender’ or Neal – a surprise package for those who didn’t see the Open Air’s Porgy & Bess – shining on ‘The Best Is Yet To Come’."

927,927,Ought To Be Clowns,17/01/2018,Ian,East, King’s Head,"On the one hand, Jessica Lazar’s production of Steven Berkoff’s East – returning to the very King’s Head theatre where it made its debut back in 1975 – is a ferociously charismatic whirlwind of stylised beauty and linguistic gymnastics that is an undoubted visceral thrill to watch and listen to. On the other though, there’s a definite sense of style over substance over the length of its two hours, and a problematic niggle about the play’s relationship to violence. Set in the East End of yore, Berkoff uses his bastardised Shakespeare’n’slang prose style to depict the lives there with an extraordinary vigour. Nabbing a cigarette off a pal and violence, sex and violence, racism and violence, day trips to Southend and violence, bus rides on the number 38 and violence, beans on toast and violence – you get the picture. East in unapologetic in the bleakness of its vision for this substrata of society and in some ways, feel eerily prescient in that. But there’s no attempt to flesh out character, provide context or offer commentary, which lends a rather wearying tone to the whole affair. There’s only so much nihilistic business you can watch before you too start to wonder what the point of it all is and presenting so much ultra-violence and sexual assault without any accompanying narrative raises uncomfortable questions about its place on the stage."
928,928,Ought To Be Clowns,07/06/2011,Ian,Chicken Soup with Barley, Royal Court,"A playwright who hasn’t received much attention in years of late, Arnold Wesker finds two of his plays about to receive major revivals in London: Chicken Soup with Barley here at the Royal Court, where it first played in 1958 and The Kitchen will open later this year at the National Theatre. Chicken Soup… follows the disintegration of an East End Jewish family over a twenty year period but simultaneously the collapse of the Communist ideals that they and their friends espouse, starting with the Cable Street Riots in 1936 and revisiting them just after the war has finished and again in 1956 and the beginnings of the Hungarian Revolution. At the heart of the play and barely off the stage, Samantha Spiro is never less than sparkling as Sarah, at once the Jewish mother forever making cups of tea and sandwiches for her brood as they rally round her, singing songs, making speeches and dreaming of a bright future, and also this political stalwart fiercely committed to her Socialist ideals even as others peel away from her magnetic influence and the ideal world they dreamed of crumbles away. It is her life that epitomises the Socialist dream and her passionate defence of the way she has lived her life, although coming too late in the play, is a stunning moment which ends the play powerfully. As her feckless husband, Danny Webb gives an equally affecting performance of a man who feels he has failed at life and is constantly reminded of the fact by his nagging wife and then later his children: he way he retreats into himself as illness then kicks in is often just too hard to watch. The decision to cast two debutants as their children – Jenna Augen and Tom Rosenthal – is an interesting one that hasn’t quite paid off yet. The play requires huge leaps between the decades it portrays and though both displayed the requisite youthful enthusiasm while still in the family fold, neither really captured the depth of the disillusionment that followed, although saddled with lengthy speeches and difficult emotional posturing which didn’t help and it may well be that their performances mature as the run progresses – a hard first ask though. Around them, there’s a flurry of small supporting performances: Alexis Zegerman’s sharp sister/aunt, Steve Furst’s kindly Hymie and Harry Peacock’s blustering Monty being the best, all adding a little much-needed levity and variation to the bleak tone. Structurally, the play’s division into 3 acts – although Dominic Cooke has stuck with just the one interval, compressing II and III together – does give the play the rather old-fashioned feel of a period piece. It does allow for one of those scene changes that the Royal Court are famous for, Ultz’s opening cramped attic apartment complete with staircase down into the depths of the stage is transformed into the much more elegant living space of later years to impressive effect. But crucially the structure also limits the way the drama plays out. Too much time is spent on the domestic battles especially in the central act and so the highly revelatory moments between mother and son come too late in the play. This is the type of “state-of-the-nation play” (I quote the promotional blurb) that is beloved of many of our theatrical critics and I am pretty sure there is a drinking game to be had in the number of times that that quote and “timely revival” will be used in the reviews that appear in the next few days. And I suspect it will go down well, not least because it seems to be Wesker’s time, but also because there is skill in the way in which the political and the personal are elided, the larger themes played out in the smaller sphere. But as with Butley, I struggled with the punishingly bleak tone, the crushing family dynamics and in the end, misery begat misery: I’ve always preferred chicken noodle soup to be honest. Lastly, there’s something intriguing about the revival of neglected playwrights and the way in which people seek to explain the reasons for it that is lent an extra potency by the fact that Wesker is still alive. Rattigan’s reassessment has been a while in the making though coming to a head in this, his centenary year, but sadly he is not around to see it or to pass comment. Wesker is though, and a rather fawning interview in The Jewish Chronicle, offers a highly illuminating account into why he feels his work has not been sufficiently appreciated – as he sees it – which doesn’t cast him in the best light and comes close to petulance. He blames casual anti-Semitism – ‘is it cos I is Jewish’ – and the arrogance of much of the theatrical establishment which moved on to other dramatists without acknowledging that it was a similar change in attitude that brought his work to prominence in the first place (and consigning Rattigan and his ilk to years of neglect) as unaware of it he might have been at the time. Indeed the interview casts a rosy glow over the correspondence between the two men as Rattigan paid huge compliments to Wesker’s writing and Wesker wistfully says he wishes he had kept copies of the replies he sent (which as Boycotting Trends pointed out is interesting considering Michael Darlow’s Rattigan biography records Wesker’s response as being contemptuous and along the lines of ‘Rattigan would be better employed writing better plays himself’) I'd be careful about picking a fight with Mr Wesker, he can be very prickly as you can see! Not sure how blog-literate he is though 😉 Interesting view on the show, I'm booked to see it next week but have no expectations, aside from an instant need to disagree with Billington's 5 stars! Ha! I don't how blog-literate he is, though debate would be fun."
929,929,Ought To Be Clowns,09/03/2011,Ian,Villa, Royal Court,"Continuing the International Playwrights season at the Royal Court was the first of two readings of Chilean Guillermo Calderón’s plays, Villa. Based around a table discussion between three women, appointed to a committee to make a decision about what to do with a mansion, the villa of the title, in which unspeakable atrocities were carried out by the (now presumably defunct) ruling regime. Tensions are running high in the community about how best to deal with it or what they are actually trying to do here, commemorate the tragedies, secure the legacy, forget it even happened, with public meetings degenerating into violence as the two proposals were debated: raze it to the ground or build a museum in it. So Macarena, Carla and Francisca are the three representatives have been selected and put into a room to come up with a decision and Calderon lets their debate run in real time with to great effect. There’s a great set-up in which it is made immediately apparent that at least one of the women has a hidden agenda here and from then on, the power games commence as they each circle the others, trying to ascertain if they are friend or foe, whether they can be relied upon for the casting vote for their preferred option. The most beautiful writing came with the scenes where Carla and Francisca each presented the case for one proposal, with achingly painful clarity that packed a hefty emotional punch, then beautifully undercut by the their final assertion that this isn’t necessarily what they believe in themselves. The quality of cast that the Royal Court has managed to pull together for these readings has generally been superb, but I could barely repress a skip of joy when I read the (previously unannounced) programme note as I entered the theatre that the rather marvellous Claudie Blakley was playing one of the women, along with Indira Varma and Emma Lowndes. Blakley did not disappoint as the slippery intelligent Francisca playing the long game with her persuasive arguments. Varma’s role was more of an equivocator to which she was ideally suited she is such an elegant performer who I would like to much more of and the passive-aggressiveness of Lowndes’ Carla with her sly manipulation of her colleagues, trying to play them off against each other, also impressed."
930,930,Ought To Be Clowns,08/10/2014,Ian,Notes From Underground, Print Room,"  Well, you might. If a healthy dose of Franco-Russian existential angst is your thing, or the chance to see Harry Lloyd deliver a wonderfully intense 70 minute-long monologue at very close quarters tickles your fancy, then Notes From Underground could well be for you. Equally, if cramped and uncomfortable seating irks (and at these prices, it really ought to), then the hour of angst you experience might very well be your own. The Print Room has recently relocated to the atmospheric but abandoned Coronet cinema in Notting Hill and this one-man show, adapted by Lloyd and French director Gérald Garutti from Dostoyevsky’s novella, is the debut show in these new surroundings. The building is clearly a work in progress and clearly has much potential, not least in its rich history not only as a former picturehouse but a theatre too, so one might be inclined to forgive a little discomfort on the derrière.  And I did, for the first 40 minutes or so anyway. The entrance into the show is brilliantly disarming – seated by ushers, we’re also welcomed in by the bedraggled figure of a man sat on a decaying armchair upstage, waving manically and boring into our souls from the off with a deep baleful gaze. As he begins to speak, it is clear that he’s not necessarily all there having cloistered himself away from society for 20 years to work on deciphering the meaning of life if not ensuring all of his marbles are still in his possession. Lloyd’s delivery is almost hypnotically rat-a-tat-tat at first as he shuttles from apparent lucidity and fevered mania, often contradicting himself several times in a sentence only to loop back around to the original statement. And as his narrator rails against the state of the world (as was, but also in many ways as still is), against humanity and the fallibility of the individual, against him and us and him again, it is hard not to get swept up in his labyrinthine trains of thought, guided by the subtle textures of Bertrand Couderc’s lighting and Bernard Vallery’s creeping sound design."
931,931,Ought To Be Clowns,15/10/2018,Ian,The Humans, Hampstead Theatre,"Huh. The Humans arrived at Hampstead Theatre with the glow of its 2016 Tony Award for Best Play still shining, particularly as its original cast have come over the Atlantic with it. And while I’m hugely appreciate of the opportunity to see another member of The Good Fight cast onstage, and the cast as a whole really were excellent, the play left me somewhat cold and unconvinced of its prize-winning pedigree. On entering, the heart sinks at the realisation that we’re relying on the much-abused trope of a family coming together around the dinner table and sure enough, beneath the façade of familial jokes and enforced holiday bonhomie (it’s Thanksgiving natch), there’s a whole world of secrets and lies waiting to burst forth. Writer Stephen Karam also layers in a trip to a whole other genre which certainly grabs the attention, but that’s not to say that it works.  Joe Mantello’s production relies on a naturalistic feel, aided by a strong design by David Zinn which makes great use of the Hampstead’s flexible stage, and the well-oiled chemistry between the ensemble is evident to see as their chat overlaps each other and really does have that feel of always being on the edge of family squabble. But when the twist comes, it fell flat for me, a turn towards the ridiculous rather than the sublime as much of what has gone before is undermined by the climax."
932,932,Ought To Be Clowns,27/11/2010,Ian,Beauty and the Beast, National Theatre,"First in an ever-increasing list of the family Christmas show market is Beauty and the Beast, currently in previews at the Cottesloe in the National Theatre. Devised and directed by Katie Mitchell with text work from playwright Lucy Kirkwood, they have reworked the traditional fairy tale into this delightful new confection aimed at girls and boys over the age of eight (and those young at heart too!) Mitchell’s twist is to have the story presented to us by magical creatures Mr Pink and Cecile with their helper, and it is these interjections that provide much of the laughs and the interesting narrative drive whereas we might be familiar with the tale of Beauty and the Beast, we have no idea where these characters might end up. She has introduced all sorts of lovely touches to engage her audience, my favourites of which were the mind-reading machine which is used on the characters to reveal their true thoughts but is also turned on some audience members too and the shadow puppets used with the lightbox to great effect. The fast-forward and rewind features were neatly done, Gareth Fry’s exaggerated sound effects are great fun, there’s a charming moment as we all look up into the stars: it all serves to capture the attention of her audience and keep it, the children around me all loved it. Justin Salinger acts as the main compere of proceedings as the Julian Clary-esque Mr Pink, an amusingly malevolent presence in fuschia and kitten heels, whose pantomime villainry is nicely tempered by Kate Duchêne’s kindly Cecile, his assistant who longs for the opportunity to sing a song onstage yet is constantly frustrated by Mr Pink’s empty promises. Salinger has a great warm charisma which works perfectly as he drives things forward, throwing out a couple of magic tricks, the odd burst of flame here and there, even conducting an insect orchestra and Duchêne’s middle-aged French fairy is perfectly played. The dynamic between these two is brilliant and the way in which the relationship unfolds is pleasingly complex for a children’s show. Duchêne’s dress is a thing of wonder too, richly textured and longing to be touched (as it was by some of the younger viewers as she walked past). By comparison, the actual fairytale was a tad underwhelming to these jaded adult eyes, but then I guess there’s only so much one can do with a story that is so familiar. Handsomely mounted in Vicki Mortimer’s design, Sian Clifford brings a nice fresh modernity to Beauty and Mark Arends’ wolf-based Beast is a brilliant physical performance, able to show great emotion even through the effective costume with its mini-stilts allowing for convincing animalistic movement. And the presentation of the enchanted wish-fulfilment ensures that kids expecting some magic will not be disappointed."
933,933,Ought To Be Clowns,16/09/2013,Ian,Wicked, Apollo Victoria,"Now entering its eighth year at the Apollo Victoria, Wicked remains one of the major go-to shows in London’s West End, beloved of fans and tourists alike. A major UK tour has just started to great reviews in Manchester, demonstrating the wide appeal of this prequel-of-sorts to the events in The Wizard of Oz but with a major cast-change fast approaching, the London production feels like it is missing a little of that emerald sparkle that has made it such an enduring success. I’ve seen the show twice before (reviews here and here) and so perhaps there’s an element of familiarity breeding contempt but I do have a fondness for Stephen Schwartz’s score and you gotta love a story that puts female friendship so firmly at the centre (many may mock the musical but how many long-running plays are there that do the same…). It was just hard to shake the feeling that maybe some people were a little demob-happy, or even maybe that the production is resting on its laurels a tad.  It’s not overtly obvious – the first-timers next to me had a whale of a time – and the performance levels were generally strong. Louise Dearman’s Elphaba may strain a little hard at times to put her own quick-spoken stamp on the famous songs, often at the expense of lyrical clarity, but she captures much of the vivacity of a young woman growing into her powers. And if Gina Beck’s relentless perkiness didn’t tick my boxes, her powerful soprano makes Glinda an equally potent force.  Ben Freeman’s Fiyero felt woefully miscast though, his vocal performance just not up to par, his dancing ill at ease amongst the talented company – it’s rare that someone in so major a role feels so out of his depth but that’s really how it came across. Katie Rowley-Jones and Sam Lupton as Nessarose and Boq, both staying with the show, were good though and old friend of the show Harriet Thorpe is good value as Madame Morrible. But that joie de vivre that ought to sing from every corner of the stage rarely manifested itself, those moments of grand emotion that make a truly great musical only giving me the goose-bumps once. "
934,934,Ought To Be Clowns,19/11/2018,Ian,Hadestown, via smart caption glasses at the National Theatre,"The exceedingly kind folk of the National Theatre allowed me to go and see Hadestown a few days after the press night, as I was most keen to have a try of the Smart Caption Glasses which were brought into circulation on Friday. Acclaimed as “a revolutionary new way for people with hearing loss to enjoy performance”, for once the blurb more than lives up to its billing as I found them to be truly innovative and potentially life-changingly good.  Without wishing to open a whole can of worms about access and diversity within the critical community, it has to be said that as a (deaf) reviewer, I never get to go to captioned performances. If and when they’re scheduled, the timetables just don’t allow for it, so – as in most of my daily life – I make do. I hear what I hear and guess the rest. So the idea of this facility becoming available was one I was most keen to investigate at the earliest opportunity.  Designed and manufactured by Epson, developed with support from Accenture, they’re available to book now for current performances of War Horse and Hadestown and looking ahead to 2019, they will also be featured for Tartuffe, Follies, Top Girls, Downstate and The Winters Tale. I picked mine up from the Olivier box office and after a simple tutorial was good to go. The glasses slotted most easily over my own spectacles, and sat reasonably comfortably there throughout the performance, they didn’t interfere or feel to heavy at all.  They really do feel like the future coming to life in front of your very eyes. All kinds of customisation can be done to the size, position and colour of the text (I went for magenta, and centre justified up top), and you can adjust them easily at any point during the performance. But the real innovation lies in the glasses themselves, the fact that they bring a transcript of the actual text (no bloody paraphrasing here!) right into your line of sight. Normally, the act of reading captions or surtitles is a tricky balancing act of headcocking, between giving yourself enough time to scan the text without missing anything that’s happening onstage. These glasses entirely remove that, placing the captions right in front of you and allowing a much more integrated experience which I found to be, quite frankly, amazing. It really does work so well as a personalised device and consequently it feels a proper step up from the normal captioning experience. My tips would be, for Hadestown at least, to go for scrolling text, as there’s just too many words and lyrics for the single line option to really work efficiently. And I found wearing a cardigan with pockets extremely useful in putting the controller somewhere that was easily accessible yet not just sitting in your lap (you’re advised not to put it on the floor so I don’t think you could pop it on top of your bag for instance).      And I have to say a big thank you to the NT staff (particularly the young woman whose name began with M which I have unforgivably forgotten) who helped me with a clear induction, patience when I couldn’t start the tutorial and my other inane queries. It is clear they have put the time in to make this as painless and accessible a process for people to get to grips with and with service like this, it certainly works. "
935,935,Ought To Be Clowns,22/10/2014,Ian,Made In Dagenham, Adelphi,"Based on the real-life tale of the Ford sewing machinists whose strike in 1968 kicked into motion a groundswell of a movement that shook Harold Wilson’s administration and culminated in the Equal Pay Act of 1970, Made In Dagenham is one of those rare beasts – a brand new big-budget British musical. William Ivory wrote the story up into a 2010 filmby Nigel Cole but here it is Richard Bean who has written the book, with David Arnold composing the score and Richard Thomas penning the lyrics, with Rupert Goold taking on directorial duties. The show naturally has had a lengthy preview period (opening officially 5th November) and I saw it a week ago, not having intended to write about it, but after a couple of people emailed me to ask my opinion, I thought sod it, I’ll write it up! So take it all with a pinch of salt, I suspect the show may not be to the liking of some but I really rather enjoyed it, with its huge amiability, its cracking lead in Gemma Arterton and that crucial level of interest that comes from a true story (and one whose legacy continues today, somewhat unresolved). I’ll be going back soon but here’s what I thought first time round. Between them, Bean and Goold seem to revel in making slightly off-kilter decisions. Making Harold Wilson an unreconstructed comedy character complete with end-of-the-pier routine with a bit of soft-show here and some salty humour there is simply bizarre, though Mark Hadfield makes a genuinely decent fist out of it. Another choice that seems rather random is the striking opening visual in the bedroom which doesn’t really play out as you think it might. But there’s plenty of things that do work – the airfix-inspired design by Bunny Christie is brilliant as is Jon Clark’s vivid lighting design and David Arnold’s score shows signs of being a cracker – at its best when best when it plays up the 60s influences in the boys vs girls swing of the opener, the girl group sway of the women chatting about life in the factory, (especially in its gorgeous middle eight), the cheeky smile of Eddie’s make-up song for Rita. I can still hum at least three of the tunes and look forward to revisiting and relistening. And a whole range of striking performances that form a great ensemble. Sophie Stanton’s filthy-mouthed Beryl is undoubtedly my favourite but Heather Craney’s slightly bonkers Clare, Sophie Isaac’s ambitious Sandra and Isla Blair’s determined Connie all shine through too. It’s a shame she only gets the one big song by Sophie-Louise Dann certainly makes it count as a fearsome but fabulous Barbara Castle and Naomi Frederick’s under-developed but excellently-played middle class ally gets one of the biggest laughs with a line about a horse. Oddly enough, the show is at its weakest when it tries too hard to fit into the traditional mould. The choice to bring in slo-mo choreography (by Aletta Collins) for the Act 1 closer ‘Everybody Out’ (see below) doesn’t really work, a shift into something too theatrical perhaps that just isn’t needed especially with the wonderfully strident message of the song and the honest pragmatism of the women themselves. And after the interval, another big production number comes with the introduction of the big bad US boss which again feels out of place – I’d rather find out more about these women and their lives than be overly subjected to a character whose main point of humour is (unacceptably in my view) saying the word f*ggot on three separate occasions (and getting a laugh each time…) So it’s good that Steve Furst’s Tooley doesn’t linger too long and that the wonderful Gemma Arterton is allowed to shine once again. She may initially seem a little bit too glam for the part (kudos to the casting directors at David Grindrod for assembling such a ‘real’ looking ensemble, but she really does nail it. The indignation of being treated as a second class worker, the barely-willing rep for her friends and co-workers, the conflict between the short-term needs of her family and the longer-term societal shift that she slowly comes to realise she is at the forefront of. Arterton grows as does Rita blossoms and I thought she was excellent. And matched with the cuddly charm of Adrian der Gregorian as her husband, they make a hugely engaging personal centre to the larger political story. So it’s a yes from me. The likes of Memphis may have something of that Broadway pizzazz but Made in Dagenham has an unmistakeably British quality about it that we should be equally proud of. There are things that could be worked on, and may well be being tinkered with as we speak, but I’m already looking forward to going again and that should be an indication of how I felt. Let me know how you found it if you’ve been already."
936,936,Ought To Be Clowns,22/02/2014,mag9l,Gaslight, Salisbury Playhouse,"Fans of overwrought cod-Victorian melodrama are definitely in for a treat at the Salisbury Playhouse, though I have to say Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 play Gaslight sadly fired up no sparks for me. Perhaps our taste in thrillers has become too sophisticated for such less complicated pleasures as these but the writing is clunky beyond belief, depressingly predictable from the off, and not helped by a production that tries to find a solution in prolonging the agony. Hamilton sets his story in the household of the Manninghams, where he is a moustache-twirling, cackling fiend and she is a near-hysterical waif of a thing firmly under his thumb, leaving us in no doubt as to what’s afoot when the question is raised of whether she is losing her sanity or some more nefarious plan is in action. On and on it goes as their staff are drawn into the narrative along with an inquisitive detective but there’s so little to their parts, barely a hint of the characterisation that would lift the majority of the play from just being functional. "
937,937,Ought To Be Clowns,31/03/2010,Ian,Your Nation Loves You, Old Vic Tunnels,"Some might say that there is a time and place for the act of making love to be represented through the medium of modern dance. Personally I don’t think there is any place in this world for it, not least in the cold dark tunnels underneath Waterloo station during an hour and 45 minutes of experimental theatre when you’re standing on your feet throughout. Your Nation Loves You is a new play by a (relatively) new company called :DELIRIUM: taking place in the atmospheric Old Vic Tunnels, a fascinating venue for an intriguing looking promenade play. 12 people, selected by the government and confined underground, placed into a network of tunnels with no explanation. As the weeks turn into months, attempts at forming a new community in the face of little hope are tentatively succeeding , but when the supplies they were receiving regularly stop, already bubbling tensions threaten to overspill. The play itself aside for the moment, so many things just felt fundamentally wrong with this production. There were too many people in the group, meaning that it was mostly very difficult to get a position where you could see the acting, and whereas the episodic nature of Edmond at Wilton’s Music Hall (another promenade production) allowed for constant reconfigurations of the audience, the scenes here were quite lengthy, meaning that if you ended up badly positioned, you missed a lot. There was no concession to letting the group move from one location to the next as we moved through the play: scenes started straightaway and so we often missed a minute or two by the time one had reached the new actors. And most unforgivable was the constant use of incidental music. That the play itself could not create the requisite atmosphere in such a quirky venue speaks volumes, and given the issues with the acoustics in the tunnels, playing a soundtrack over the dialogue at times verged on the ridiculous. It was acted competently enough, but with so little development of plot, story or character progression, it was hard to care much about anyone. With little explanation forthcoming, the initial premise was squandered and in its place came a less interesting (for me) study of how we as a society behave under extreme pressure. And when you don’t care about characters as they are talking, it is even worse when they start making love through the medium of modern dance. This was an overlong sequence that had me alternately looking in vain for the door and stuffing my scarf in my mouth to prevent my giggles from echoing too much: anyone who thinks that two makeshift watering cans touching is erotic should be locked in these tunnels for good for real. When the physical theatre returned towards the end, my heart sank. This is completely the wrong type of venue to incorporate this kind of work, with an ambitious running time, padding the action out with these sequences felt like a punishment to the feet, and with the temperature being so low, left us unnecessarily chilled to the bone. The initial use of the tunnels promised to be an interesting one, but as the play progresses, it is apparent that there has been little imagination used in utilising the location’s idiosyncrasies. Only with the revelations towards the end does it appear how the venue has been used, but this adds nothing to our own experience and so seems a wasted opportunity. Upon arrival, one is given a survival kit from the “Department of Data Protection” containing warnings, a match, a sticking plaster, some dried pineapple and a sweetie, a nice little touch but one which wasn’t mentioned or utilised in the play, so I just felt sorry for whichever poor soul has filled all these bags up! As an introduction to a new venue for me, this was interesting. In terms of a drama, I found it sadly lacking and the whole experience did not live up to its initial promise which was a real shame. As a new company, I think there’s a lesson to learn both for :DELIRIUM: in developing new shows, but also to all theatre companies in really examining what works well in particular spaces. You know you're always wondering if male nudity or directly addressing the audience is going to be this year's ""thing?"" I have a horrible feeling it's actually ""innovative"" (*cough* *splutter*) movement that's there for no other reason than ""we kept having to do this at drama school so SURELY we're actually meant to use it somewhere?"" I still hadn't recovered from Henry V so I really could have done without it here. Ah, male nudity on stage how I miss thee. Although am off to Hair tonight…and in Beyond the Horizon I had the strange experience of a character taking off his shirt and washing himself from a bucket whilst making eye contact with me almost entirely throughout, I didn't know where to look 😉 (well you know what I mean!), quite a view from the front row! This on the other hand had no redeeming features. And even the twist, which barely registered with me, I don't think was 'a good thing' because it added nothing to our own experience of the evening, it just limited how much of the tunnels we could see. Harrumph. I take it you're booked into Beyond the Pale? If you mean have I booked for Beyond the Horizon then yes, although not until the end of May and I have 3rd row so I guess I won't be getting any eye-contact. (I'm assuming that Beyond the Pale was an understandable Freudian slip because you were still thinking about Your Nation Loves You.) Ah wait, now I see there actually IS a show called Beyond the Pale, just looked at your review. No, the phrases ""interactive theatre"" and ""Southwark Playhouse"" together sent me into a cold sweat after the last time. Have booked now for Monday though. (This is still Nick, I think LJ's having problems so it's not verifying me for some reason.) Unsurprisingly, I hadn't intended to go either but fate conspired to put a ticket in my hand! And I'd be interested to hear what you made of it. The original reference was made as I felt it was a much better use of space, but as I bet you've been to much more genuinely interactive theatre than I, I'd like to know your take. I've put my BTP review up now, which I think largely agrees with yours. It's definitely bizarre though how similar two shows can be in theory, and so completely different in practice. The survival bag is used throughout, you just had to pay attention. You could interact with the actors – giving the food to one character who force fed to to the girl who had stopped eating. And at the end when everyone says the famous last words (a brilliant touch I thought) a lot of people lit up their matches and blew them out when they felt ready. You really didn't think to use anything in your kit?"
938,938,Ought To Be Clowns,08/05/2012,Ian,The Sunshine Boys, Savoy,"This new production of Neil Simon’s The Sunshine Boys might be considered one of the hottest tickets of the summer, featuring as it does the West End debut of Danny De Vito and the return to the stage of Richard Griffiths. The tale is of Willie Clarke and Al Lewis, a long-suffering former vaudeville comedy act whose relationship over the 40 years of their career deteriorated so badly that they didn’t even to speak to each other off-stage for the final year. But when a television network decides to put on a comedy retrospective more than a decade later and call on Lewis and Clarke to reprise their schtick one more time, it seems that old animosities are still fresh in the mind of some. I saw the show in preview (and I have to say I find it a little cheeky to have a 3 week preview period for something clearly advertised as a limited 12 week run) and the best thing I could say about it was the amount of room for improvement. Thea Sharrock’s production felt extremely lethargic, especially in the interminable first half, with much more zip and zing needed by all concerned. De Vito’s bitterly retired Clark plods a little too much and needs more connection with his environment, especially with his nephew and hapless agent Ben, a hard-working Adam Levy, who is pushing for the reunion. And when Griffiths finally arrives on the scene, the cantankerousness is palpable but this just isn’t paired with any sense of the history between the characters. Part of this will come as the run progresses, actors dig deeper into their character and the director gets a stronger handle on things. But part of it is also the very old-fashioned nature of Simon’s script. This is old-school through and through and lacks any real kind of freshness or insight into the corrosive allure of fame and the depths of backstage hostility. Jokes are laboured and oft repeated, the eventual reveal of their most famous sketch largely falls flat, the story becomes one in which we have very little reason to invest. The saving grace comes with the penultimate scene and a stellar cameo from Johnnie Fiori as a whip-sharp nurse who gives as good as she gets whilst looking after a convalescent comic as the humour feels so much more natural here, it flows easily rather than the forced feel of the first act which tries too hard and for me, fails."
939,939,Ought To Be Clowns,27/06/2013,Ian,Rutherford and Son, St James,"It’s nice to be able to get the opportunity to follow through on recommendations from other bloggers – on a snowy day in Colchester, Gareth advised me to try and catch Northern Broadsides’ revival of Githa Sowerby’s Rutherford and Son on its original tour but I was unable to fit it into the diary. So the announcement of its transfer to the St James was a most welcomed one but also a pleasing fit for what one hopes will be a frequent use for this newest of London’s theatres. Set in 1912, John Rutherford is an archetypal paterfamilias, ruling both at work and at home with at iron fist. But the family business, a Yorkshire glassworks, is struggling and his three adult children are all entirely dissatisfied with their lot – his professional success has come at huge personal cost and it takes the most unexpected intervention to get him to even consider the changes would secure his legacy. It is grim and dark and repressed, but also fierce and powerful and surprisingly relevant. A woman writing well ahead of her time, Sowerby nails much of what is so important about family dynamics both around the dinner table and in the work place, especially in a household that is so dominated by one man whose efforts have transformed their social position yet left them stranded without a clue. "
940,940,Ought To Be Clowns,26/10/2016,mag9l,Amadeus, National Theatre,"Perhaps fittingly, on an evening when beautiful tribute was paid to the late Howard Davies, whose invaluable contribution to the National Theatre (36 productions over 28 years) will sorely be missed, there’s a sense of the passing of the guard with director Michael Longhurst making his main stage debut in the South Bank venue. Longhurst has been establishing himself quite the reputation (Constellations and Linda at the Royal Court, Carmen Disruption at the Almeida, A Number at the Nuffield, an extraordinary Winter’s Tale earlier this year, and the brilliant The Blackest Black at the Hampstead, to name just a few) and his graduation here feels entirely earned. He makes his bow with Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus, a play that premiered at this very theatre in 1979 (another sad loss, as Shaffer passed away this summer) and with the enviable resources to hand here, mounts an excellent production. The play depicts a largely fictionalised version of the intertwined lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri and their rival careers, and the Southbank Sinfonia are on hand to provide live orchestral accompaniment. So that when The Marriage of Figaro is premiered, we get an excerpt; when people read the sheet music, we don’t have to imagine the notes of the page, we hear them out loud. And though the play takes place in the late eighteenth century Viennese court, the Sinfonia remain in modern dress, a constant reminder of the timelessness of Mozart’s music, how it has endured, thrived even. This is best displayed in a breathtaking sequence that closes the first half, Longhurst at his bravura best. Using the full space of the Olivier, designer Chloe Lamford sweeps a platform forwards, backlit with increasingly powerful floodlights from Jon Clark, on which period-dressed singers contrast with contemporary musicians as they give a soaring rendition of part of the Requiem. Then the lights drop, the musical ecstacy pauses and Lucian Msamati’s Salieri gives an excoriating speech as he’s utterly consumed by jealousy – it’s an extraordinary theatrical moment. Msamati (following on from Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom in what must be close to a career-best year for him) is simply superb as the Machiavellian manipulator who can’t believe God has forsaken him for another, his silky asides to the audience rich with biting comedy, his outrage never less than bitterly heartfelt. Adam Gillen is a brattish vision in baby pink Doc Martens along with his finery, a magnificently awesome display of genius-wrapped arrogance that clearly irritates the court as much as his music inspires, and there’s crucial work too from Karla Crome as Mozart’s lover, then wife Constanze, a smaller but no less significant role of real heart.  The biographical inaccuracies, such as they are, may still frustrate some but as a psychological study of jealousy, and how we – both as society and individuals – treat those considered to possess genius, Amadeus is a powerful play indeed and this is undoubtedly a stunning production thereof. We’re also amusingly often reminded of the dangers of making judgments – the court often scoffs at Mozart’s work, some people may have previously been unimpressed by this play – but I’m throwing my hat in with this, a resounding success for a cast and creative team at the top of their game, and the perfect tribute to Shaffer.  "
941,941,Ought To Be Clowns,22/09/2014,Ian,Evita, Dominion,"Right, first things first, Marti Pellow’s name is deliberately bigger than Madalena Alberto’s on the poster. Really? He may have the greater name recognition factor, indeed Popped In Souled Out was one of the first cassette albums I ever owned, but is the show called Che? It is not, it is called Evita. And more significantly, in the role of Eva Perón, Alberto delivers an utterly magnificent performance (one which should give Anna-Jane Casey pause for thought in the recently rewritten Forbidden Broadway, star quality indeed…) which far outshadows Pellow’s perfunctory work. Simply put, this is not a West End-standard leading man turn and so demanding higher billing than the show’s true star feels even more inexcusable. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s show has been touring the country since May 2013 and has now turned up at the Dominion Theatre to finish its run with a seven week stint in the West End. It’s quite a successful transfer too – Matthew Wright’s design holds up well on the vast stage and directors Bob Tomson and Bill Kenwright ensure a sense of grandeur infuses this story of the rise to power of Eva Perón under the auspices of her husband Juan who became the Argentine president. Creatively, the only disappointment comes in Bill Deamer’s choreography which lacks the organic Latin spirit that so elevated the last West End revival (the explosive power of that ‘Buenos Aires’ is one of my all-time favourite theatrical memories). But that barely matters when Portuguese singer/songwriter/musical theatre actress Alberto is on stage. Her Eva starts off as a scrappy little thing but her fierce ambition soon shines through as she clambers up the social ladder as best she knows how, ending up where she was surely destined to be, as First Lady. Her voice is stunning throughout but where she really impresses is in her acting – every line of ‘Don’t Cry For Argentina’ is suffused with scarcely believing wonder, the bitter crack of emotion in a heart-breaking ‘You Must Love Me’ aches from every movement of her broken body. She is just glorious to watch and to listen to and single-handedly justifies the return of this show to the West End."
942,942,Ought To Be Clowns,25/05/2013,Ian,Yellow Face, Park Theatre,"London’s newest theatre opened its doors in Finsbury Park last week but the Park Theatre also has a more intimate studio and it is the UK premiere of David Henry Hwang’s Yellow Face that christens that space. Hwang was the first Asian-American to win a Tony for Best Play and so was a predictable figurehead for the 1990 protests against the casting of Jonathan Pryce in a Eurasian role in the Broadway production of Miss Saigon and it is this that forms the starting point for his play Yellow Face which questions ideas of race and identity and whether any such thing as a multicultural society can really exist when prejudices continue to weigh in from all sides. Hwang uses his own experiences but also weaves elements of fiction into the play – the version of himself who is the lead character is (barely) renamed DHH – to create something of a fantasia, which allows him to heighten the absurdity of many of these situations whilst simultaneously maintaining the chilling realisation that most of it is not too far from reality. It’s a heady mixture and one which frequently pays off. The trickiness of dealing with the sensitive subject of race is tackled head on and with no little humour – trite aphorisms about tolerance and looking beneath the skin are constantly rehashed and recycled, even borrowing lyrics from an En Vogue song at one point, as the difficulties of verbalising what racial identity really means and just how important it actually is are thrown under the spotlight. So from the Miss Saigon debacle, we move to a farcical scenario where DHH gets involved in his own casting scandal when he employs a white actor as an Asian in one of his own plays, trying to pass him off as a man with Siberian Jewish descent and unwittingly creating a faux ethnic crossover superstar in the process. And latterly we watch a financial scandal envelop his banker father with its uncomfortably institutionalised anti-Chinese rhetoric, a much more serious strand to the drama and one which ultimately feels the most compelling. The play does take a while to get there though, Hwang mocks his own self-indulgent tendencies in the text, and it is hard not to feel that some judicious trimming could make this into a shorter yet more intense interval-free experience.  That said, there’s much to enjoy in Alex Sims’ committed production, staged in the round with Lily Arnold’s simple but effective design. Kevin Shen makes a remarkably assured stage debut as an engaging and frequently bemused DHH, and the remaining six actors rattle through a vast array of supporting characters with quick-changing verve. Ben Starr is excellent as Marcus Gee, the corn-fed American who somehow becomes the biggest new star in the Asian community; Christy Meyer is sizzling as a calculating journalist determined to play on perceived notions of patriotism to get the scoop; and Gemma Chan and Davina Perera also both impress."
943,943,Ought To Be Clowns,28/02/2019,Ian,i will still be whole (when you rip me in half), VAULT Festival,"There’s something inevitably perverse that it isn’t a show in the aptly named Cavern that proves to be the first directorial mis-step that I get at this year’s VAULT Festival, but rather one in the comparative intimacy of the Pit next door. Wrapping the audience around all four walls has its definite advantages in establishing a certain kind of relationship with the audience but Helen Morley’s production crucially sacrifices a huge amount of audibility in doing so.  And again, you can kind of see why the choice was made. The nature of Ava Wong Davies’ writing in i will still be whole (when you rip me in half) lends itself directly to the ruminative and muted. And as it takes the form of two monologues that wind ever closer, the movement of the two actors reflects both the emotional distance that exists and the way that it fluctuates. But the hushed delivery and static nature of many a scene proved fatal to actually hearing much of the text when presented with an actor’s back. So hands up, I can’t speak to the entirety of Davies’ text, I just couldn’t hear swathes of it. What I did catch was densely poetic in its excavation of the mutability of identity through a (British) East Asian lens, suffused with extended pauses and the swells of Amanda Fleming’s sound design. And not as connected as I would have liked to be, the pacing felt thus felt a little off, straining just a little hard to impose a moody atmosphere rather than letting it grow organically."
944,944,Ought To Be Clowns,19/09/2018,Ian,Square Rounds, Finborough Theatre,"You spend so much effort and labour and time
When trying to make all your words somehow rhyme
So how you would write a whole play that does so
Is downright impressive, that’s something you know Espec’lly since Square Rounds is not so dramatic
But more of an anti-war talk, so dogmatic
Though new life is brought by a d’rector called Jimmy 
Whose insight and forethought makes ev’rything shimmy It’s unlike most other things you can now see
And its all-female cast will just fill you with glee
But Finborough and Haddock are hard words to rhyme
So I think this format has now done its time  Tony Harrison’s predilection for writing in verse has been explored before at the Finborough (as has my determination to respond, badly, in kind) and it is certainly a style that takes some getting used to. Particularly here, as he explores the development of weapons of mass destruction, often by scientists who had entirely ideas about the application of their innovations or technology. And as he moves from a chemist inventing poison gas to the inventor of the machine gun, he throws up into stark relief the question about where morality sits within science. Do the potential benefits of a fertiliser outweigh its efficacy in a gas chamber, is there such a thing as finding a ‘better’ way for people to die, is scientific progress really worth it when so many people have died, are dying, will still die. The play’s structure in a series of more-or-less chronological vignettes means that the drama here is dialled right down in favour of a lecture-ish format. But Jimmy Walters’ direction introduces a sprinkling of magic which is just right for these modern would-be wizards, and supported by an array of expressive performances from the likes of Eva Feiler as Justus von Liebig (founder of organic chemistry) and Philippa Quinn as Fritz Haber (the Nobel Prize-winning German Jewish chemist whose work on poison gases was so terribly abused)."
945,945,Ought To Be Clowns,12/06/2016,mag9l,Phaedra(s), LIFT 2016 at the Barbican,"Funny story – I actually bought a ticket to see Phaedra(s) in Paris when it was first announced, such is the hold that Isabelle Huppert has over me. Naturally having done so, a few months later a short run at the Barbican was announced as part of LIFT 2016 and for once, I erred on the side of caution by opting not to head over to the Odéon–Théâtre de l’Europe and waiting for its arrival in the UK (something I didn’t do with Kings of War in Amsterdam…) It probably helped that I had already made the trip to Paris to see Huppert once before, 2014’s Les Fausses Confidences crossed that boundary and I’m glad, for though there was much to appreciate in Phaedra(s), it is extremely challenging too. Stretched over 3 hours 40 minutes with just the single interval, Krzysztof Warlikowski’s multimedia-heavy production stitches together different versions of the story of Phaedra, the wife of Theseus who fell in love with her stepson Hippolytus, with predictably tragic consequences. It’s a durational performance, in more ways than one, testing the patience from the off with a newly commissioned version from Lebanese-Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad that has clear intentions to shock but in the manner of a stroppy teenager, plenty of show but little of substance, as stylish as it may look in Małgorzata Szczęśniak’s sharply contemporary design. Sarah Kane’s Phaedra’s Love fares a little better, a measure of darkly-veined humour sprinkled amidst the sex and violence being reprised in these twisted relationships. Finally, the most effective part of the triptych is the selection of excerpts from JM Coetzee’s novel Elizabeth Costello in which the titular academic discusses the Greeks with a colleague, using Racine’s Phèdre as an example to act out their theories on the sex and power dynamics between gods and mortals.Throughout we get dance from Rosalba Torres Guerrero, which adds little apart from doubt on Warlikowski’s judgement, and the cumulative effect is little short of, well, exhausting."

947,947,Ought To Be Clowns,13/09/2016,mag9l,If We Got Some More Cocaine I Could Show You How I Love You, Old Red Lion,"Aside from a corker of a title, John O’Donovan’s If We Got Some More Cocaine I Could Show You How I Love You also marks a significant moment for the Old Red Lion as the first production to hail from its newly relaunched literary department. Aimed at further supporting both the development and staging of new writing, it has made an intriguing start with this rather delicately, and deceptively, meditative play.  In a small town in the west of Ireland, Mikey and Casey are hiding out on the roof of the latter’s family home. Hiding because they just raided a petrol station for a pathetic haul and having had a little more luck in relieving Casey’s mother of a wodge of cash and his stepdad of his stash of cocaine, they’ve legged it from the police and now they’re just waiting for them to leave so they can head on to a Halloween party. But with their perspective shifted by being up in the air and in some ways out of time, something of the confessional booth emerges on the rooftop slate. For they’re not just accomplices, they’re lovers and as they exchange stories and reveal truths and simply, just tell each other how they feel, they edge closer and closer, with just the shadow of a weighty secret about to be divulged to get in the way. The beauty of O’Donovan’s writing is that it is so heartfelt, allowing two young men such emotional agency feels like a precious thing and as he folds in aspects of the world around his characters – the homophobia and racism, the impact of the financial crisis, the realities of being gay in a small town – you begin to really feel for them as they remain trapped on Georgia de Grey’s expanse of rooftop under Derek Anderson’s textured lighting."
948,948,Ought To Be Clowns,20/12/2013,Ian,Coriolanus, Donmar Warehouse,"This is truly a Coriolanus for our times. Josie Rourke’s intimate chamber production for her Donmar Warehouse made ripples by casting Tom Hiddleston in the title role, a rare return to the stage for an actor now catapulted into Hollywood’s hotlist, but in so many other ways, it is an intelligent reading of the text that subtly recasts Shakespeare’s tragedy into something if not exactly relatable, then certainly recognisable. Roman general Coriolanus is viciously successful on the battlefield but when he is urged to move into a political career, he faces a whole new set of challenges. Enormous pressure from his domineering mother that has stunted his lifelong emotional growth, a disdain for the very same ‘great unwashed’ whose votes he needs, and an establishment gunning for him from the word go. Rourke ensures huge clarity in her adaptation of this most brutal of tragedies which proves most compelling. Beautifully spoken with a seemingly effortless ease, Hiddleston’s undeniable upper-class-ness makes him the ideal patrician antihero – a blithely arrogant, if effective, soldier turning into an ill-suited politico whose views on the ‘real world’ call to mind something of the current government’s rhetoric. And of course he’s pushed into it by his mother, a jaw-droppingly excellent Deborah Findlay, whose Volumnia scorches the earth before her with the heat of her militaristic fervour.  The manipulative tribunes Brutus and a gender-swapped Sicinius, here renamed Sicinia, personify the hypocrisy of the sceptical political classes, Elliot Levey and Helen Schlesinger capturing perfectly their sly machinations and slippery doublespeak. Peter de Jersey and Mark Gatiss are both strong as Coriolanus’ allies and in another piece of timely casting, Borgen’s Birgitte Hjort Sørensen deals gracefully with the thankless role of his wife Virgilia, making up for her lack of dialogue with the most expressive of faces."
949,949,Ought To Be Clowns,11/05/2011,Ian,A Delicate Balance, Almeida,"A Delicate Balance won Edward Albee the first of his three Pulitzer Prizes and director James Macdonald has brought it to the Almeida Theatre as the fourth of his plays to be performed there. Albee is perhaps best known for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and this play shares similarities with that work in its focus on the travails of rich urban socialites, their relationships and what nastiness lurks beneath their genteel facades but A Delicate Balance pulls the focus a little wider to look at an entire dysfunctional household. Tobias and Agnes are a couple whose very well-appointed life of cocktails and social clubs suggests a world of comfortable privilege. But from the off, it is evident all is not quite rosy as we discover they sleep in different bedrooms, Agnes’ alcoholic sister Claire is living with them and their daughter Julia is experiencing marital discord, for the fourth time though still in her 30s. Further complicating matters is the arrival of their best friends, Harry and Edna, who arrive unexpectedly, utterly traumatised by an unknown fear at their house, and having decided to move in with them. When Julia arrives back at the family home the next morning, having indeed split up from her fourth husband, to find strangers in her childhood bedroom, the battlelines are drawn as family are pitched against friends and loyalties stretched to their limits. The action plays out on Laura Hopkins’ attractive wide oval dressing room set, complete with hall and staircase leading upstairs at the back, and never moves from there. The events of the play stretch over a long weekend, but it is ultimately less about what happens as the struggle of Agnes to maintain the careful, delicate even, balance in the face of the ever-shifting power dynamics in her house as the rules of society dictate the maintenance of civilities even in the face of outlandish behaviour and hardly anyone says what they are actually feeling. It is therefore quite the actors’ play and with such an exquisite cast as this, I found it to be an utter delight, even though it is bleak and quite uncomfortable at times. As the East Coast society mistress, Penelope Wilton looks as different as I’ve ever seen her and delivered her precise, wordy, deliberate monologues with a wonderful touch. And the scenes in which she faces off with Imelda Staunton’s boozy sister are close to theatrical perfection – how these women aren’t Dames yet I do not know. Staunton really does make the most of her embittered spinster, unconstrained by society’s rules and so the only one who really speaks her mind, taking a vicarious thrill in unleashing on all and sundry but also suggesting the pained realisation behind the eyes as she goes too far, time and time again. She in turn has a great relationship with Lucy Cohu’s spoilt brat of a daughter, the bond between niece and aunt initially stronger than with mother, the implications flying that Julia is on the path to turn into Claire, and Cohu has great fun playing the daughter regressing to childish antics as she can’t get her own way, her voice remaining a thing of heartbreaking wonder. As Tobias, Tim Pigott-Smith is also excellent: initially something of a verbal punching bag, quietly tolerant of his wife, sister-in-law and daughter and their endless talk but provoked into making a firm response as his house guests start to make themselves comfortable and when he does, it is with a hugely powerful emotion that is spell-binding. But most curious of all are the characters of Harry and Edna as portrayed by Ian McElhinney and Diana Hardcastle. Never having seen the play before, their arrival was a moment of near horror and the lack of obvious explanation accompanying their behaviour ensured that their presence kept proceedings as taut as a drum, Hardcastle in particular expertly treading the fine line between dark humour and psychological thriller that in essence characterises the whole play. A Delicate Balance is beautifully judged, dark and unsettling at times to be sure, but never less than totally engrossing. And though I am oft-times teased for my predilection for dames-in-waiting, the evidence is right here on the stage in Islington, acting simply does not get better than this and yet both Wilton and Staunton are integral, unshowy parts of a truly top-class ensemble. Book now: this has to be one of the few truly unmissable shows currently playing in London and will surely sell out. Hi – saw it last night.It made me THINK – and i DO NOT LIKE THAT! Do ""we"" owe obligations to family/blood ties more than friends.  Do either of these groups have rights?????? Still thinking and still not liking it. And still reeling from the impact of that horrible family and their nasty freinds"
950,950,Ought To Be Clowns,15/08/2011,Ian,Dames at Sea, Union,"The Union Theatre have definitely identified their niche in London’s cluttered theatre landscape: small-scale revivals of musicals that might otherwise have languished in obscurity with productions that are big on ambition. The latest show to get the Union St treatment is Dames at Sea, a 1966 parody of 1930s musicals with book and lyrics by George Haimshon and Robin Miller and music by Jim Wise which much like The Drowsy Chaperone, grew from its beginnings as a short sketch into a full show. Though it was entertaining enough, I couldn’t help but feel that this was the Union treading water rather than blowing our socks off with something great. The piece itself is a show about putting on a show – it feels like they all are at the moment! – the cast of a musical have to find a new venue as their theatre is being pulled down but the arrival of a ship full of sailors with connections to the chorus offers a solution. Stuffed full of clichés from the small-town girl arriving on Broadway with nothing but her dreams, the big diva who then feels threatened, the sailor who just happens to be an amazing songwriter, chance meetings with former partners a-plenty, the list goes on… A problem for me lay with the uncertain tone between parody and straight performance, Kirk Jameson’s direction seemed to waver between the two rather arbitrarily and in the intimate space of the Union, it thus felt a little exposed: are we laughing with, or at this. The biggest issue though was in the lack of quality tunes, not a one of them truly memorable or really clever enough to carry the humour of the show, focusing on the spoofy side of things a little too much and just not musically interesting enough to compare with serious good musicals. I’m perhaps being a little bit harsh: the enthusiasm of all concerned cannot be doubted in the way Drew McOnie’s delightful choreography is carried out, the singing was bright under MD Richard Bates and the hammy acting wryly observed: Gemma Sutton and Daniel Bartlett are both strong and sweet as the central couple. Rosie Ashe is great value for money as the deposed diva, it was an awful lot of over-the-top-ness for such a small space, the excessive volume proving contagious throughout the ensemble."
951,951,Ought To Be Clowns,05/11/2010,Ian,The Lady From The Sea, Royal Exchange,"The second part of my double bill at Manchester’s Royal Exchange was the production in the main theatre Ibsen’s The Lady From The Sea. Presented here in a new version by David Eldridge, using a literal translation by Charlotte Barslund, it marks the third time Eldridge has delved into the Nordic playwright’s work, this time working his stuff on one of his lesser-performed works. Just as a quick aside, I can highly recommend the blueberry cheesecake muffin from the bar at the theatre, it was a little piece of heaven!! Set in a small fjordside Norwegian town, living a passive half life between sea and mountains, Ellida broods over her past love, despite having settled into a comfortable marriage of convenience with Doctor Wangel. Her reluctance to play the role of doting wife and stepmother results in Wangel bending over backwards to try and please her by inviting a man from her past to stay and cheer her up yet a web of misunderstandings and frustrations, that stretches all the way throughout this household, as the pull between domesticity and emotional freedom is explored. In the main role of Ellida, Neve McIntosh plays the part of the outsider well, her Celtic demeanor marking her as different from the outset but it is such a cool and distant performance that it didn’t really generate any empathy from me. Her turmoil at the dilemma she faces remained understated and whilst Scandinavian reserve might have been the order of the day, a little more passion at the return of her sexy sailor might not have gone amiss. Reece Dinsdale’s Wangel is too much of a wet blanket to engender concern at the state of his marriage and Bill Ward’s appearances as the sailor are far too brief to make any kind of an impression making this central thread rather underwhelming. I enjoyed the subplots of the Wangel daughters more with their slightly more engaging storylines and more colourful characters. Sara Vickers as Bolette gave brighter light to the predicament that women faced, of what level of compromise is acceptable in order to achieve fulfilment and Catrin Stewart played Hilde’s dark humour well, connecting with Samuel Collings’ very good Lyngstrand. The overall direction of the play didn’t help matters either: everything is very muted and Sarah Frankcom’s choices always err to the subtle, leaving it feeling generally unfocused. Liz Ascroft’s design doesn’t evoke enough of the sea which is meant to be ever-present, the use of projections is quite clunky and forces the actors to use the space oddly; the sound never rouses out of the languid and nor does the lighting. Altogether, it is cohesive but it just did nothing for me."
952,952,Ought To Be Clowns,18/02/2010,Ian,Measure for Measure, Almeida,"First things first: this has a double revolve, a double revolve people!! Two bits that move independently from each other! And a table that rises up from the ground! And now breathe… So, from the Shakespeare play I know the best, to one which I’ve never seen before in two days. Measure for Measure sees one of the largest casts ever at at the Almeida, 17 if you’re wondering, and I caught a preview last night. Set in a Vienna which is riven with sexual depravity and political misdeeds, the Duke of the city decides to leave it in the hands of his hardline deputy Angelo, whilst remaining about incognito in order to see how he fares in restoring order. He disguises himself as a friar where he encounters the highly religious Isabella, who is faced with the prospect of sacrificing her virginity in order to save her brother’s life, that brother having been sentenced to death by Angelo for getting a girl pregnant before they were married. There is then all sorts of gameplaying that ensues, both political and personal, as we rush headlong to the conclusion which may or may not include lots of weddings. The choice to update it to modern-day is a curious one, and one that hits you in the face as soon as it starts with a quite jarring opening sequence. It really doesn’t feel like a timeless play though: the political intrigues and manoeuvrings feel current, but the moral codes that drive Isabella seem so alien and the ending is just bizarre. The idea of marriage as a cure to moral decline (despite what the Tories may think) and also as a means of punishment is not one that sits well at any point, least of all in this setting. And I felt the production design was a little confused too, with a mixture of period and modern details and costumes that didn’t fit well together. The revolves move quickly enough, in creating a range of locations, aided with some superb lighting the prison cells look excellent, but their endless permutations did grow a little tiresome (the ghosts of Too Close To The Sun have ruined any chance of me taking a revolve Anna Maxwell Martin displays an astonishing command of the Bard’s language in her Shakespeare debut as the novice nun Isabella, her ‘fie fie FIE’ alone gave me goosebumps; Rory Kinnear made me very excited for his Hamlet at the National Theatre with a nuanced performance of the moral hypocrite Angelo, suggesting there’s more to this puritan than meets the eye, some humanity at least rather than straight villainry; and Lloyd Hutchinson provides great comic relief as the loose-tongued Lucio. Ben Miles is saddled with the extremely difficult part of the Duke who leaves the dirty work of imposing morality onto his people to his deputy, an unknowing fall-guy, and displays incredible selfishness in the finale: he manages ok but needs to lose some of the mannered feel to his verse-reading and allow in some more subtlety into his voice. Personally, I just don’t think I liked this play at all, and so despite there being strong elements to this production, I could not say I much enjoyed the experience. Oft classified as a problem play, the only problem for me is that I don’t think it is a good play. Working in much ambivalence at the results of the Duke’s machinations at the ‘happy’ ending resolves some of the issues, but I couldn’t help feeling I’d seen the same thing at the recent National’s All’s Well That Ends Well. Underwhelmed by both the Almeida and the Donmar in three days, who’d’ve thunk it! It's a difficult play to be sure, but I think the imposition of a moral code on a society has more resonance today than you give credit for.Though I agree that opening pole dancers were out of place and out of keeping with the rest of the production."
953,953,Ought To Be Clowns,09/03/2013,Ian,The Deep Space, Old Red Lion,"Lancashire-born Lila Whelan’s debut play The Deep Space follows in the steps of last year’s extremely well-received Mercury Fur in identifying the Old Red Lion as an excellent theatre to put on claustrophobically intimate and emotionally intense pieces of drama. And whilst this is ostensibly a subtler affair than Ridley, Whelan has constructed a perceptively layered play which unwinds and uncoils with a measured precision as a conversation between two women in a nondescript interrogation room somewhere in the north of England delves into the depths of genuine psychological horror. The sharply-suited Caitlin is a New York-based lawyer-type figure meeting with Sam, a mother whose family has died in a house fire but as she slowly teases the story from her reluctant client, terrible secrets come tumbling from the closets of both women. To say much more is to get dangerously close to spoiler territory, but it isn’t saying too much to say that it is upon this crucial relationship that the show hinges and it delivers it well. Whelan takes on the insistently probing Caitlin, impatient but inescapably drawn to the case and convinces of her crumbling composure and as Sam, Abbiegale Duncan nails the sullen demeanour of a young woman dazed from the considerable amount that life has thrown at her. Whelan chooses to reveal the stories of the past, such as they have impacted on present actions, through flashbacks sprinkled into the narrative and whilst it is an effective way of drip-feeding the necessary information into the story, they didn’t always have the same sense of urgent purpose as the main confrontation. The minimalist design does too little I feel and what it does, isn’t quite clear enough. Oliver Yellop’s charismatic Liam makes a persuasive case for the complexity of marital abuse though, bravely showing that there can be a grey area even in the most shocking of circumstances."
954,954,Ought To Be Clowns,11/07/2016,mag9l,Sally Phillips and Lily Bevan – Talking To Strangers, Soho,"Such is the case with Talking To Strangers, which is co-written and performed with RADA alum Lily Bevan. A series of monologues in which characters talk to, you guessed it, strangers, Talking To Strangers originally aired on Radio 4 as a sketch series. As a stage show, it makes for a surreal hour packed with sharply observed character detail. Performed as a series of monologues, alternating between Bevan and Phillips, the show opens somewhat ambivalently with a yoga instructor addressing a class with a monologue packed with the kind of tortured metaphors anyone who’s ever attended a yoga class will be familiar with. Subsequent characters fare much better, including a Swedish researcher very reminiscent of Phillips’ recurring turn on Veep as Finnish premiere Minna Häkkinen. Throughout the evening it becomes clear Phillips and Bevan are chasing characters, not punchlines. At frequent points throughout the show, they deliberately shun more ‘classical’ rhythms of comedy and choose instead to offer more character introspection. That’s not to say the show isn’t funny – Phillips’ sterling deadpan wrings out laughs from unexpected places throughout the evening, and Bevan showcases a virtuoso talent for accents as both a reluctant Catherine of Aragon impersonator and a French wellness expert. If the evening’s forays into satire never quite land – the wellness shtick is all stuff we’ve heard before, for example, the evening truly takes flight when Phillips and Bevan are most comfortable taking us to some strange places. In particular, the penultimate segment, in which a Yorkshire community support group are gradually marked for death by Bette Midler ringing them, is an absolute delight, and manages to be hilarious and moving all at once."
955,955,Ought To Be Clowns,01/02/2014,Ian,The Duchess of Malfi, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,"Review the seat or review the play? Whilst I’d love to just focus on The Duchess of Malfi, the experience at the newly constructed Sam Wanamaker feels so inextricably entwined with the level of (dis)comfort that comes from the seating and exacerbated by ticket prices that are best described as hefty and take little real account of the relatively restricted view many of them offer. It’s all very well for critics to dismiss such concerns when they’re not having to compromise on sightlines due to cost but it all adds up to a very real part of one’s theatrical experience.  So safe to say, I was hugely uncomfortable for large parts of the afternoon and bitter about the price I was paying for the privilege. But having been exhorted to go and see the play due to it being a decent piece of drama (and crucially far superior to Jamie Lloyd’s recent version which I loathed) I kept reminding myself that the tip was a good one. And it is impossible to deny that Dominic Dromgoole’s production is a strong one, well suited to the unique charms of this new theatrical space which is lit entirely by candles.  The candlelight is used most effectively throughout this darkest of Jacobean dramas, proving to be quite flexible in the way it utilised in the u-shaped auditorium, and not just in the special atmosphere it creates. This is something that extends to the play itself, feeling a much different beast from the Old Vic, almost like a new play in fact as I had been previously told. Gemma Arterton’s Duchess is a world away from Eve Best, more fragile perhaps but warmer too, especially when connecting with Alex Waldmann as her servant lover Antonio, the cause of much strife. "
956,956,Ought To Be Clowns,28/11/2012,Ian,Straight, Bush Theatre,"Though Nick Payne is the name on most people’s lips when it comes to exciting new male playwrights thanks to his award-winning Constellations, for my money DC Moore is as equally deserving of such attention. He is probably one of the most talented composers of dialogue working at the moment and his clear-sighted writing has definitely marked him out as one to watch. Directed by Richard Wilson, his latest play Straight opened in Sheffield earlier this month but now arrives in London at the Bush Theatre to present a picture of male friendship unlike most others. Based on Lynn Shelton’s film Humpday, Straight starts off in a moment of apparent marital bliss. Lewis and Morgan are making the best of a bad lot in their property situation but are so into each other that they are discussing babies. But when Lewis’ old university friend Waldorf arrives, through the letter box first, to collect on a promise of a bed after he finished his gap year travels, he threatens to upset their dynamic by reminding Lewis of the freedom he is midway through relinquishing. A drunken night out ensues with much taunting about their comparative sexual adventures and ends up with them daring each other to have sex on camera, as you do.  The hotel room is booked, the video camera is prepped and neither guy wants to be the one to lose face by backing down and so the scene is set for a highly comedic traipse to the edge. But though it is exceedingly funny – one of the funniest lines of the year comes from the dismissal of any concerns about the ethics of pornography – it is also astutely emotionally complex and most importantly, it just feels so authentic. Moore’s script is deceptively straightforward, peppered with contemporary references to Downton and Michael Gove, but cuts to the heart of the delicate emotional state of its protagonists. There’s no attempt to overegg the pudding by contextualising events within a larger thematic framework, instead there’s just an acutely observed portrait of what it is to deal with aspects of contemporary young adulthood in a world where certainties are few and far between. And this fragility is perfectly captured by a cast who are thoroughly attuned to the rhythms of the naturalistic language, so much of the dialogue sounds just like the conversations from the bustling foyer. Returning from a gap year that lasted for seven, Philip McGinley’s Waldorf arrives in a truly unique style but his extrovert personality can’t always hide the insecurities and sense of dislocation that has settled on him. And Henry Pettigrew’s buttoned-up Lewis has a gorgeously bashful reticence, his relation of a would-be university dalliance is just perfect and utterly believable in its evocation of those crushes we never act upon.  But though the issue of fluidity around sexuality – Wilson neatly suggests potential latent desire even from the first time the two lads see other as Lewis rugby-tackles Waldorf onto the bed – is delicately and thoughtfully handled, Moore’s writing also delves into the fears that come from the assumption of grown-up life. Shafted by a housing market that has left them in negative equity and stuck in a cramped studio they had intended to rent out, Lewis and Morgan start off the play so undaunted that parenthood is definitely on the table but soon find themselves wondering if the grass is in fact greener on the other, responsibility-free, side. "
957,957,Ought To Be Clowns,19/12/2013,Ian,Stephen Ward The Musical, Aldwych,"It’s a curious thing, to take a relatively obscure figure, base a musical on him that is then named after him, yet leave a vacuum where his central presence ought to be the driving force. For all that Andrew Lloyd Webber, Don Black and Christopher Hampton place the character of Stephen Ward at the centre of Stephen Ward the Musical, he remains far too inscrutable, far too unexplored for us to buy into the main premise of the show which is that Ward, who committed suicide after being made the scapegoat for the Profumo scandal of 1963, is a tragic victim of Establishment hypocrisy. But for all Alexander Hanson’s sterling efforts as the osteopath-turned-social fixer who engineered the first meeting of Secretary of State for War John Profumo and wannabe showgirl Christine Keeler, the show suffers from making him narrator as well as protagonist. So he is lumped with huge swathes of exposition, made increasingly worthy due to a slavish attention to real-life events, as a huge cast of characters flash by momentarily in the service of telling a story, but leave us none the wiser as to what Ward was like as a person, what motivated him, what moved him. His first, and only, flash of real emotion comes at the 11 o’clock number as he realises the hopelessness of his fate but even then it strikes a duff note of self-justification, proclaiming he’d ‘never meant any harm’ and that he only ever wanted to be ‘kind’. But this is to overlook the sordid nature of so much what he did as a fixer for the great and good, supplying them with fresh new girls and even if his relationship with Keeler as always platonic (as suggested here), there’s something uneasy about the show’s desire to canonise a dirty old man, to cleanse him of all guilt entirely.  And this hollowness echoes around Richard Eyre’s production, Don Black’s lyrics are often groan-worthy in their reach for neatly rhyming couplets, Hampton’s book rarely delves beneath the surface and Rob Mumford’s design underwhelms with its unclear projections. Lloyd-Webber’s score is blessed with some lovely moments – though the forced pastiches of novelty 60s songs unbalance the first act somewhat – with at least a couple of hummable melodies, but without depth of character to accompany the singing, it rarely reaches the ecstatic highs of great musical theatre.  A key example is in the show’s best song ‘I’m Hopeless When It Comes To You’, delivered gorgeously by Joanna Riding in a luxury cameo as Profumo’s wife but a moment robbed of so much of its potential because it is the only substantial contribution her character makes to the entire show, the attention suddenly demanded to this marriage coming out of the blue. Performances are actually strong across the board – Charlotte Spencer’s Keeler and Charlotte Blackledge’s Mandy Rice-Davies are good fun, Anthony Calf makes a convincing toff and Ian Conningham is excellent as a key character in each half. "

959,959,Ought To Be Clowns,21/12/2013,Ian,Blink, Soho Theatre,"2012 saw Phil Porter’s Blink take Edinburgh and then London by storm with its quirky charms – its study of grief and love intersecting on two quietly damaged souls – and so it is hardly surprisingly that 2013 has seen the show travel as far as India, before returning to the intimacy of the Soho Theatre’s upstairs space. Director Joe Murphy has wisely kept original actors Rosie Wyatt and Harry McEntire onboard and the luxury of revisiting the production was one which I enjoyed immensely. There’s much that connects Jonah and Sophie – each has lost a parent to cancer and both are struggling to adapt to life in London, barely keeping afloat in the great metropolis. So it seems right that they gravitate towards each other in their own inimitable way, finding their own sort of connection, masquerading as love. For though this may seem like an indie version of a rom-com, its heart lies somewhere deeper, more meaningful in uncovering the complexities of being with another.  Wyatt and McEntire are both excellent, completely unafraid of the closeness of the audience in this attic room, connecting strongly through the compelling charm of their monologues and sharing that emotional intensity through no small measure of eye contact, which pulls the watcher right into their world. It’s a delight of a play and a corker of a production, definitely recommended."
960,960,Ought To Be Clowns,28/11/2009,Ian,Sweet Charity, Menier Chocolate Factory,"Continuing their run of reviving classic musicals for Christmas, the Menier Chocolate Factory have turned their attentions to Sweet Charity this year. Stuffed full of instantly recognisable songs like ‘Big Spender’ and ‘Rhythm of Life’ by Cy Coleman and Bob Fosse’s inimitable choreography, the story of Charity, a girl trying to escape her life as a dancehall hostess and find a decent man is one of the classic movie musicals and so my expectations were high. And I am pleased to say they were largely met. Tamzin Outhwaite is a revelation here, (to me at least) never having watched anything with her acting I’d had my doubts, but she really is very good here. A brilliant comedic actress, her scenes trapped in the closet and at the diner were laugh-out-loud funny, but she was also effective at conveying the joie de vivre that gets Charity through the trials of life without being at all cheesy. Her singing was consistently good plus she has some great dancing skills.  In a curious decision, there’s some doubling up of the major supporting cast which isn’t always successful. I quite liked the choice to have Mark Umber playing all 3 of Charity’s men friends: their appearances were consecutive so he was only ever playing one at any one time and they were characterised differently enough so there was no confusion. Less successful was the decision to have Josefina Gabrielle play both Charity’s friend Nicky and the filmstar Ursula. There was a point when she literally ran from one scene on one side of the stage into the next scene on the other side. Had this been a tiny fringe company then this might have been understandable, but there’s about five other women, any of whom could have taken one of the roles. Still, Gabrielle was great value for money, looking and sounding gorgeous and none more so when she was make-up free for ‘Baby Dream your Dream’ with Tiffany Graves who also gave good solid support. And importantly for any big musical, the ensemble numbers were all top-notch. The company (at least five of them imported from Hello, Dolly!) sounded amazing and were tightly drilled with some fierce dancing going on, Ebony Molina’s frugging was an eye-popping standout and I particularly liked the fact that there was a real mixture of body types throughout: for one it gave more authenticity to the brothel scenes and also kept a grittiness to proceedings, anchoring it in some semblance of reality rather than the flightiness of a Broadway dream."
961,961,Ought To Be Clowns,06/01/2016,mag9l,DÓTTIR, Courtyard,"With a set-up that reads like a Shakespearean version of the Englishman, Irishman, Scotsman joke, Whit Hertford’s new play DÓTTIR takes an interesting spin through the Bard’s knotty relationship with gender. So Ophelia, Desdemona, Jessica, Cordelia, Lavinia, and Kate the Curst wake up in a room from which Miranda has just fled and the Jailer’s Daughter has just been placed. But it’s far from a joke, they’re all handcuffed and anonymised in monochrome utilitywear and balaclavas. And when a piercing siren sounds, we bear witness to the extent to which they fear their unseen captor. One by one, they detail the faults ascribed to them in their respective plays (Hamlet, Othello, The Merchant of Venice, King Lear, Titus Andronicus, The Taming of the Shrew, The Tempest and Two Noble Kinsmen, in case you weren’t sure), as told them by men. But Hertford then does is to delve deeper into each woman and her circumstances, building up backstory and fleshing out detail, giving each character their due. This is done to varying degrees of effectiveness but crucially, you come to realise the commonalities that Shakespeare gave them in their parental relations. "
962,962,Ought To Be Clowns,21/01/2020,Ian,You Stupid Darkness!, Southwark Playhouse,"The world outside is going to shit and all you can rely on is the kind word of a gentle soul, if any still exist. So far so 2020, but this is also the set-up of Sam Steiner’s warmly inclusive You Stupid Darkness!, a Paines Plough and Theatre Royal Plymouth production seen on the south coast last year and now making its bow at the Southwark Playhouse. Something apocalyptic has happened, society seems to be on the edge of collapsing and the shops are beginning to run out of doughnuts. Despite this catastrophic breakdown, volunteers still come once a week to answer the phones at Brightline, listening patiently to outpourings of woe from strangers, offering the hope of connection – a hope they come to rely on just as much.   Steiner’s minor-key writing keeps the focus very much on his quartet of workers, and the relationships that ebb and flow between them. We never learn what is happening outside, why they need the gas masks and it is to his credit, along with director James Grieve, that we never really need to. Instead, tales about tissue box inventors, trombone solos and tiny kindnesses are what populate this office. And they do so beautifully, their gentle sway recalling something of Tom Wells’ knack for finding the engrossing in the everyday. Even when the pendulum goes for a bigger swing, as in the crushing one-two that ends the first act, a giddy happiness giving way to something much darker, Steiner and Grieve keep us rooted in a place where the small things – a rueful smile, the glow of a tealight – just might pull you through.  The refusal to open out the scope might frustrate some but for me, it intensifies the performances perfectly as it call out for empathy for everyone. Andrew Finnigan (so good in Drip) finds real charm as the work experience lad who grows in confidence, Andy Rush (another Wells alumni, this time for Jumpers for Goalposts) is brilliant as the sardonic but never unkind Jon, Jenni Maitland’s pregnant boss Frances is full-on mother hen to them all and Lydia Larson as the more fragile Angie is heart-breakingly good as we come to realise how much of her own trauma she is working through. A quietly, beautifully uplifting chink of light through the winter dark."
963,963,Ought To Be Clowns,04/05/2015,mag9l,In A Better Place, Hotel Pelirocco – Brighton Fringe,"In the august surroundings of Brighton’s Regency Square, the Hotel Pelirocco is something of a subversive delight inside – a boutique hotel with an extraordinary range of themed bedrooms inspired by the likes of Bettie Page, Diana Dors, Lee “Scratch” Perry and The Sex Pistols. And it is in Bettie’s Boudoir – who knew you could fit so much leopardprint into one room… – that Caroline Byrne’s In A Better Place begins, as we eavesdrop on a squabbling couple. They’re arguing because they’ve missed the funeral they came down to Brighton for, increasingly suspicious behaviour from Jay causing Priya to question her husband but neither are in the mood for talking, never mind paying belated tribute to their friend Eva. So she cools her heels whilst straightening her hair and he heads down to the bar (as do the audience) to catch up with his mates but the unwitting banter that follows unleashes a whole world of seriously pent-up marital strife. It’s an interesting concept, the idea of eavesdropping on private conversation, and one which is undoubtedly heightened by being pressed into the intimacy of a hotel room. Byrne and director Scott Le Crass wisely return the action to the bedroom (oo-er) for the play’s final scene as the middle section in the bar-room doesn’t come off quite as effectively, too remote and static as Jay and his pals literally prop up the bar reminisce about the deceased, the former pop star Eva, and compete over how close they were to her. Rather, it is in Jace Desay and Mariam Rasekh’s performances that the production causes real sparks – the curt passive-aggressiveness, the furious declamations, the reproachful realisations, the deconstruction of their relationship is skilfully written and handled – even if perhaps there’s a little too much dwelling on food (they co-own a catering business) as a metaphor for their partnership. "
964,964,Ought To Be Clowns,07/09/2013,Ian,Grounded, Gate Theatre,"Watching Lucy Ellinson perform is probably one of the greatest treats UK theatre has to offer us. There’s something about her searching directness that makes sitting in the audience of one of her shows a much greater act of participation that most of us are used to. Utterly unafraid at reaching out to every single person in front of her, the surprise of eye contact with you still feels uniquely special and something important is shared even in the seconds of that fleeting moment, even if you’re not quite sure exactly what it is. When it breaks, as it must, you feel bereft, craving the next one when it comes, and so it goes, pulling you entirely into the immediacy of her performance. Perhaps not everyone has this same level of engagement with her, but I find it impossible to imagine that anyone could sit through Grounded and just feel like they had witnessed just another show. Playing at the Gate after a hugely successful Edinburgh run, George Brant’s monologue is a searing indictment of drone warfare but also a fascinating exploration of the struggle of balancing the experience of being a soldier in combat with the realities of family life.  Ellinson plays The Pilot whose career in her beloved F-16 fighter jet is curtailed when she unexpectedly falls pregnant on a leave. To stay in the institution that has provided the only life she knows, she becomes a drone pilot, working 12 hour shifts operating the remote controlled vehicles that patrol the skies above the warzones but finds herself wholly unprepared for the huge differences that becoming a wife and mother have made to her. Not only that, since she’s operating from a trailer in Vegas and going home every night, she’s confronted daily with the ugly incompatibility of the hot-blooded world of conflict and the relative normality of her newfound domestic situation."
965,965,Ought To Be Clowns,09/01/2013,Ian,Fiesco, New Diorama,"Last January, The Faction’s rep season at the New Diorama was an unexpected but much welcomed surprise for me as their ensemble took on Twelfth Night, Mary Stuart and Miss Julie to great effect and it seems I was not alone, as the season was a sell-out success. So they have returned in 2013 with three new plays: Three Sisters and Blood Wedding will come soon but first up is no less than a UK premiere, of Schiller’s Fiesco, a dark swirling tragedy of sixteenth century Italian city politics. Determined to unseat the long-ruling Doge of Genoa and prevent his tyrannical nephew from succeeding him, a group of conspirators from the Genoese nobility plot to overthrow him and establish a republic. But they’re a diverse group full of individually selfish motivation and as charismatic playboy count Fiesco rises to become the head of the conspiracy, it is clear that the prospect of the ducal throne is just as appealing, if not more so, than simply deposing the ruling family. And so layer upon layer of treacherous intrigue is built up as betrayal comes as often as blinking as revolution threatens to erupt and disrupt all. Daniel Millar and Mark Leipacher’s new version has a clear-sighted vision and solid line of storytelling and as its AD, Leipacher’s direction has a strong sense of the capabilities and opportunities offered by The Faction’s ensemble. When it works, it is stunning, with innovative touches and beautiful imagery sparking off the stage. Gareth Fordred morphing from murdered son to grieving father has a touching grace; the freeze-frame effect used to pick out a game-changing murder out of the heaving mass of the ensemble is highly effective; and the way in which the billowing fabric of the coveted ducal robes become the architect of downfall has a cleverly elegiac beauty."
966,966,Ought To Be Clowns,03/06/2011,Ian,Rumours, Hen + Chickens,"Neil Simon’s farcical comedy Rumours has been transplanted from New York to Oxford in this RoAm Productions/Madison Theatre Company co-production which is now playing at the Hen + Chickens theatre pub at Highbury Corner. Occasionally, I like to go into a play completely blind, knowing nothing beforehand in order to be completely surprised. It is rare that I get the chance to be unspoiled about a play but like a bag of Revels, you never know what you’re going to get. Unfortunately here, the show turned out to be a farce which is one of my least favourite genres! The show is set in the country home of Charley and Vivian on the occasion of their tenth wedding anniversary but as the four couples invited to join them arrive, they are left to their own devices as Charley is stuck upstairs with a gunshot wound to his earlobe and Viv is nowhere to be seen. But as Charley is the Finance Minister and it turns out that the gunshot wound was self-inflicted and intended to kill, the guests gather round to cover up the political scandal that would ensue once the police get involved but soon get caught up in a tangled web of lies, alibis, stories and subterfuges in order to protect reputations all around. There is a huge amount of energy onstage, some of it very fresh and appealing, but far too often it wasn’t sufficiently marshalled and so manifested itself at times as an auditory mess with too much arbitrary shouting and some hurried gabbling of lines which needed to be clearly enunciated for clarity’s sake over the surrounding din. Dialling down the volume and controlling the speed and trusting the humour in the writing to come through rather than forcing the issue through performance perhaps would have made it stronger, but this is very much a matter of personal taste – not everyone wants their pandemonium to be controlled like me."
967,967,Ought To Be Clowns,06/04/2011,Ian,Crawling in the Dark, Almeida,"The Almeida Theatre has long been developing links with a younger audience through its Almeida Projects programme and Crawling in the Dark is their seventh play that has been especially commissioned for young people. Writer Natalie Mitchell has created a response inspired by the show currently playing in the theatre, David Eldridge’s The Knot of the Heart and its examination of how personal responsibilities and family relationships are affected by substance abuse, but shifting the focus onto the teenagers in the family. Living on an Islington council estate, Amber and Nathan are reunited with their hard-partying mum Liz after a while staying at their grandparents. It soon becomes clear though that her behaviour masks a much darker secret and the huge weight of caring for their mother and trying to conceal the truth of what she is up to falls on the too young shoulders of these two. Kellie Bright as Liz struggling to deal with her drug habit whilst caring so very deeply for her kids was heartbreakingly good, a sympathetic portrait of a mother unable to extricate herself from the tangles of addiction. Along with Tahirah Sharif and Michael Lewis, a believable family dynamic was created from the outset, the easy familiarity with each other utterly convincing making their struggle all the more poignant. Sharif as excelled as the older of the siblings, carrying more of the burden but the weight of the responsibilities pushing hard on her and threatening her burgeoning relationship with the compassionate Freddie, played with charm by Tobi Bakare. Michael Lewis’ younger and consequently less able to adjust Nathan was also well-played, acting out in school and hungry for stories of happier times and family memories to cling onto. It is no secret that I wasn’t a fan of The Knot of the Heart at all, so I was a little hesitant about this show at first, but I found it to be far superior in the end. The stronger emphasis on personal responsibility made Crawling… much more accessible and believable and the directness of Mitchell’s writing, although ostensibly for a younger audience, made for a much more refreshing and honest-feeling experience. Michael Buffong’s direction also made better use of the revolving set and the pulsing soundtrack of 90s choons kept things moving nicely. And it was also interesting to see how an almost wholly teenage audience responded to the play, much more vocally forthcoming about what stimulated them and most fascinating to see the points at which they felt lines had been crossed. Great review, ditto. I felt exactly the same (particularly about Knot).  There was something incredibly powerful about being in a theatre with such a raw, untainted audience. Their refreshing lack of cynicism added a fizzy extra dimension to an already brilliant piece. "
968,968,Ought To Be Clowns,31/05/2010,Ian,Ingredient X, Royal Court,"Katie’s invited her friends Deanne and Rosanna round to watch X-Factor in their swish apartment with her partner Frank, a recovering drug addict. The women take pleasure in treating him like a skivvy, sending him out on random errands for their wicked amusement. But when he disappears for more than half an hour, doubts about his whereabouts and the strength of his recovery creep in and Deanne and Rosanna, themselves haunted by their own failed relationships and their own insecurities, waste no time in antagonising Katie, playing on her inherent fears about Frank’s possible relapse. The best performance of the night comes from Lesley Sharp as the embittered Rosanna, displaying great control of some viciously barbed speeches, toying dangerously with her more fragile friends but not quite able to conceal her own brittleness at being unable to detach herself from her ex’s travails. She is well matched for laughs by Lisa Palfrey’s Deanna who provides a neatly comic turn, but less successful when saddled with a heavy-handed clunky monologue about her struggles with alcohol. James Lance as recovering drug addict Frank and Indira Varma as Kate his co-dependent partner are well-matched as a couple, gingerly exploring the limits of their trust for each other and testing the strength of their relationship. The idea seems to be that everyone is suffering from an addiction of one form or another whether it is reality tv, drugs, marrying addicts, alcohol, obsession with ex-partners, even video games, but in allocating one addiction per character, it doesn’t have the necessary cohesion for a strong theatrical piece. As a whole, it ends up feeling undramatic and a little disjointed, like a set of monologues with some scant connecting material. It also has the uneasy feeling of something being off on several levels. Would these three women really have been such good, long-lasting friends, and could they honestly say that Varma had really lost her looks? Where do they all live, a suburban cul-de-sac is mentioned, but it feels like we’re in a loft conversion. There’s the suggestion of Frank’s OCD which makes sense in terms of him needing to control his life in order to manage his addiction but this is only done through his ordering of the tv remotes, it really does need to be much more obvious for it to be meaningful. And even something as simple as the publicity, which focused heavily on the links to reality television, The X-Factor in particular, ended up being really quite misleading and thus annoying as my expectations were really quite different."
969,969,Ought To Be Clowns,13/02/2010,Ian,Ghosts, Duchess Theatre,"Ghosts, or Ghostsssss as it seems to be called in this production (this was an early preview), marks the directorial debut of Iain Glen, who also stars here alongside Lesley Sharp. Shocking beyond belief when originally performed in the nineteenth century as one of the first plays to mention syphilis (the ghost of the title) and a damning indictment of Victorian morality: today it has lost this scandalous aspect so the focus necessarily becomes more on the devastating effect of keeping damaging secrets and how the sins of the father are revisited on his son. The play centres around Mrs Alving (Lesley Sharp), a embittered widow whose husband was a notorious philanderer yet Victorian wisdom and the advice of her spiritual advisor Pastor Manders (Iain Glen) dictated that she stay by his side regardless, despite society knowing full well what he was like. The return of her son Osvald (Harry Treadaway) who she sent to Paris to escape the corruption of his father marks the possibility of a new beginning but it seems history is doomed to repeat itself as those ghosts keep on whispering. I’m not a particular fan of Ibsen, but I do try to keep an open mind and revisit his plays to see if I can be won over. Here, I tried, I really did, but I just could not stay awake during the first 30 minutes or so: the opening scenes are so static and just flat, they really do not pull you in to the intrigue of the action to damning soporific effect. Things do pick up somewhat, but the whole pacing of this production was just too lethargic for me and the addition of an interval in this short play was quite unnecessary in prolonging my experience. The drawing-room set is nicely dressed with a pale bleached Baltic feel and I loved the ‘curtain’ which is the front wall of the house, the windows of which we can peer through, and credit to the lighting designer whose naturalistic lighting effects are just beautiful. Sharp’s Mrs Alving is also bleached of emotion, buttoned up and scarcely able to shake her icy protective exterior and over-riding desire or duty to control everything, but, and it pains me to say this, there was an occasional touch of over-acting and the way she repeatedly said ghosts provoked an almost uncontrollable desire to giggle, it was too much for me. Iain Glen’s hypocritical pastor is nicely played, setting the moral tone for people to live by regardless of the human impact of his preaching but Harry McEntire has the unenviable task of trying to make us care for a character whose fate forms the climax of the play yet is curiously underdeveloped by Ibsen, and I wasn’t a fan of his rather shouty performance. This version plays up the class differences between the servants and the others, it is Frank McGuinness of course, and whereas this did provide an amusing side to Engstrad’s buttering up of the pastor, it just isn’t a Scandinavian thing. We still seemed to be in Norway, so I couldn’t see how the imposition of (Irish?) class values worked unless the play had been fully relocated."
970,970,Ought To Be Clowns,21/02/2014,mag9l,The Odyssey, Derby Theatre,"Homer’s epic poem The Odyssey is a cornerstone of Western literature and so unsurprisingly has endured and thrived as part of our cultural consciousness since the 8th century BC when it was composed. So its tale of soldier Odysseus’ 20 year absence from his home in Ithica due to the 10 years of the Trojan War and then a troublesome 10 year journey back feels an appropriate fit in the centenary year of the Great War, especially given Mike Kenny’s new version and Sarah Brigham’s inspired direction. For this interpretation digs deep into both the psychological and practical effects of war. The first half asks searching questions about the nature of telling war stories, Odysseus’ recounting of his trials become a meditation on survivor guilt as he revisits decisions made in the heat of combat, the sacrifices he asked of his men, struggling to rationalise the huge losses incurred. And part two turns its view on those left behind and the difficulties they have to face in welcoming back someone who has been unutterably changed by their experiences.  The atrocities of wartime are timeless and Brigham’s production reflects this. Kenny’s writing puts a contemporary take on the language but maintains the device of the Greek Chorus to spin its tales, costumes hint respectfully at the early twentieth century but there’s nothing heavy-handed about the treatment. Rather there’s just an aching sadness at the damage done to so many in times of conflict, the cracks radiating out far beyond just those directly involved and suggesting why preventing matters from descending into a never-ending cycle of violence is so damn difficult. The weightiness of the concept is excellently borne here though, resulting in a thrilling piece of theatre. The first half is just fantastic – the simplicity of Barney George’s design allows an inventive sense of play to shine through with head-biting Cyclops, whirlpools, flocks of sheep and herds of pigs easily but strikingly evoked. And Ivan Stott’s sound design and compositions, assisted by his own live violin playing, form a beautiful aural backdrop, none more so than in the haunting call of the siren song. The second half lacks a little of the excitement as it plays out more traditionally but what it loses in invention it gains in intensity. Wole Sawyerr’s Odysseus struggling to deal with the return home he thought would never come, Emma Beattie’s Penelope scarcely believing her husband is back yet barely recognising the man he become, the brutality now part of their lives exemplified by the horrific fate of one of her maids, one of the most hauntingly effective pieces of stage violence I’ve ever seen."
971,971,Ought To Be Clowns,21/06/2015,mag9l,Iphigenia in Tauris, Rose Bankside,"Iphigenia is dead, long live Iphigenia. At the Almeida’s Oresteia, audiences are privy to the a rare dramatisation of the sacrifice of Agamemnon’s daughter according to Aeschylus via Robert Icke but south of the river at the Rose Bankside, we find an alternative Iphigenia who escaped that fate with some divine intervention according to Euripides via Goethe (and also translator Roy Pascal). It makes for a fascinating chance to witness just part of the plurality of responses to Greek tragedies and explore something of their enduring popularity. Roy Pascal’s translation of Goethe’s Iphigenie auf Tauris was originally written for the BBC in 1954 but remains a muscular piece of striking poetry, densely packed but piercingly urgent when it needs to be, it is frequently arresting not just in its feminist leanings but also in its yearnings for a peaceful solution to conflict. The role of the Chorus is removed, the gods are relegated to background players, the story thus becomes altogether more humane – a sister’s sacrifice, a brother’s pain, the capacity for love and forgiveness that we all possess.  We meet Suzanne Marie’s Iphigenia now living in exile in the land of Tauri (modern-day Crimea) where she’s devoted her life as a priestess in the Temple of Diana. Her work has included persuading King Thoas to stop the practice of sacrificing any strangers who turn up in their land, something which becomes more pressing when the latest shipwreck washes up two Greek gentlemen, one of whom turns out to be Orestes, her brother who thinks she is dead and has murdered their mother in retribution for her slaying of their father.  Torn between a king who has protected her for many years and who now wants to marry her, and the promise of a family life that she has long been denied, the play hinges on the demanding role of Iphigenia and Marie deals sensitively with this totemic part. Sparing us none of the anguish as she finds out what has befallen her family, she layers in vulnerability to her power, creating a character whose hard-earned wisdom shines above all, reminding the men who surround her who is really responsible for the bloodshed that haunts them.  Pamela Schermann’s production makes customary good use of this historic venue, Gillian Steventon’s set using its ruins to suggest Hellenic temples, its water to evoke the lapping shore of the Mediterranean, and Petr Vocka’s lighting heightening the atmosphere of this already charged world. James Barnes’ stubborn Thoas is a model of recalcitrant masculinity, Ben Hales’ tormented Orestes is powerfully moving and as his companion Pylades, Andrew Strafford-Baker subtly suggests an emotional depth akin to the Song of Achilles. "
972,972,Ought To Be Clowns,04/01/2010,Ian,Priscilla Queen of the Desert, Palace,"It’s based on the film of the same name, where three ill-matched drag performers take a road trip from Sydney to Alice Springs to meet up with the estranged wife and son of one of them, and little has been changed. Of the three leads, Tony Sheldon is superb as the transexual Bernadette, armed with a lifetime’s collection of quick one-liners, a steady grace and an unerring conviction in who she is. The trumpet anecdote is one of the funniest things you will hear all year and Sheldon’s performance holds the show together, elevating it beyond a series of drag turns. He is matched by Oliver Thornton as the overtly flamboyant Felicia who sweeps onto the stage in a spectacular opening number and almost steals the show again with the culmination of his particular journey. His performance practically reinvents the word camp but crucially he reminds us of the boy beneath the make-up throughout, and the relationship between Felicia and Bernadette is nicely portrayed with their acidic barbs finally making way for a grudging respect. By comparison, I found Jason Donovan underpowered and horribly affected, his campisms were way OTT, it looked like he thought he was in a pantomime. There’s no attempt to really mine any emotional depth here, many of the key issues raised are skated over smoothly and that is probably right, given the atmosphere of this show. It is a party, and it all lends the one genuinely moving moment, Tick reuniting with his son over a tenderly sung duet, all the more emotional wallop. My only real bugbear, Jason Donovan’s mannerisms aside, was the lingering doubt of how much real singing we were hearing in the theatre. It may just have been the sound design but hardly any of it sounded live, not to say that it wasn’t but rather that I prefer my live singing to be a bit more obvious."
973,973,Ought To Be Clowns,21/10/2009,Ian,An Inspector Calls, Garrick,"JB Priestley’s period thriller, adapted here by Stephen Daldry, opens in 1912 with the self-satisfied Birling family celebrating the engagement of daughter Sheila to Gerald Croft. Oozing wealth and pomposity, Arthur Birling takes the opportunity to share his theories on money and success along with the glories of being on the right side of the social divide. Interrupting this cozy evening strides Inspector Goole, who informs them a young local girl has killed herself just hours before. As he quizzes them about her sacking, pregnancy and suicide, the previously composed family gradually falls apart as various revelations about their involvement with the girl come to the surface and how each of them contributed to her downfall. The set is a sight to behold with an exaggerated sense of perspective adding a disorienting effect, but the Birlings’ house is really something else. Throughout the play, the house visually represents the fortunes of the family in a way that took me completely by surprise! Perched on stilts, with dolls-house dimensions, the house perfectly exemplifies the social hierarchy that affords the Birlings’ their upper-class arrogance and lack of a sense of responsibility. And this is what really shines through in this production, is the indictment of the way in which the upper and middle classes have treated their working class brethren. Less clear to me was the setting of the play in different time periods: I think we reached the consensus that although the family and their house were in 1912, the rest of the set, and so the world that the Birlings were interacting with was actually 1944 (when the play was written), suggesting that the actions of society in 1912 were responsible for the terrible events of the two World Wars. Although looking back on it, I wonder whether Daldry’s intention wasn’t to indicate simply that the upper classes hadn’t learned their lesson even then."
974,974,Ought To Be Clowns,04/06/2016,mag9l,Minefield, LIFT 2016 at the Royal Court,"Bringing together veterans from both the Argentine and British sides, Lola Arias’ Minefield is a piercingly potent exploration of the 1982 Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas conflict. Now in their 50s, these six men – Lou Armour, David Jackson, Rubén Otero, Sukrim Rai, Gabriel Sagastume and Marcelo Vallejo – have worked with Arias to create a fascinating collage that blends fiction with fact, a documentary realness enhanced by a little dramatic flair. As such, Minefield doesn’t seek to retell the political narrative of this war, but rather reframe it in our minds as a collection of personal experiences, further refracted through the prism of theatremaking. This is apparent from the beginning, as each man reenacts their audition process live to camera, which is played out on Mariana Tirantte’s striking cuboid set (video work by Martín Borini), their gentle humour soon giving way to recollections about their lives as military men.  Played in English and Spanish, with each section surtitled in the other language, we find ourselves invited into the sharing of something that often feels deeply private. The brutal emotional impact of battlefield reality, the psychological scars left behind no matter if on the ‘winning’ or ‘losing’ side, the true hollowness of political rhetoric performed through a series of devices like therapy sessions, chat-show segments, Spitting Image masks and raw musical outbursts. The format may seem a little distancing but it works supremely well to maintain a crucial emotional clarity to Minefield. It would have been easy, too easy, to resort to lachrymose manipulation as the men recount the horrors of war, so the analytical approach here allows a more clear-sighted route into what we’re hearing. It doesn’t make it any less horrific – fleeing a sinking battleship, burying bodies, identifying blown-up limbs of comrades – but it offers a way to process it, as much for the PTSD-afflicted of the soldiers as much as the audience. The blistering musical accompaniment further builds a bond, allowing a sharing that overcomes the linguistic difficulties."
975,975,Ought To Be Clowns,05/02/2011,Ian,and the little one said…, Cock Tavern,"Marking my first visit to Kilburn’s Cock Tavern Theatre was a trip to see a new play and the little one said… by Laura Stevens. Centred on the story of Ben, who was kidnapped as a 10 year old boy and has finally been reunited with what remains of his family after 8 years, the play looks at his difficult transition back into the real world, away from his abductor, a situation made much worse by a hungry media who won’t leave this potentially huge (as they see it) story alone. Stevens managed the slow reveal of information about Ben’s predicament extremely well, drawing the audience into the awful truth about what happened and the utterly devastating effects of terrible grief on a family. And in being economical which exactly what she divulges to us, the power of the play is amplified as our minds race to imagine what could have inspired the anguish we see on the faces of the people he tells. She is ably served by an excellent performance from Chris O’Shea as the traumatised Ben. Suffering from something akin to Stockholm Syndrome with his ongoing concern for his captor, O’Shea portrayed the emotionally stunted teenager with an affecting directness, painful at times with his warped ideas of love and sex, his inability to socialise and the slow journey to acceptance of what has happened to him. As his twin sister, Samantha Scott had a superb vitality, her teenage vocabulary feeling beautifully accurate in both its profanity and its awkwardness in articulating how she really feels after 8 long years. She really comes into her own though with a stunning monologue as she finally manages to articulate the pain she has suffered, the abandonment of a separated twin, it is a stunning moment. Maeve Ryan manages to pull off that rarest of beasts, a journalist with morals, as the kindly Ella who struggles to deal with the opportunities of the chance at a massive news story as she realises the impact it is having on the person she has come to know, behind the headlines. Adrian Francis’ Dad suffered from being the least developed of the characters, not really giving enough depth beyond the confusion of a parent without the ability to comfort his child and Francis relying a little too much on a shouty style when more subtle shading might have been more convincing. Still, it helped to further intensify the action in the already intimate Cock Tavern, director Charlotte Peters opting to maximise the claustrophobic feel of being trapped, whether by the media outside the door or the oppressive fear of terrible experience. and the little one said… is rarely an easy watch, few plays about child abduction are, but Stevens’ play has a pleasing acuity that cuts deep to the uncomfortable 24/7 news culture that has developed, forcing ‘celebrity’ on victims of tragedy and demanding easy answers even when none are instantly forthcoming. And in sketching the dynamics of these events on a shattered family, she alights on an emotional honesty which is bruising but ultimately moving, especially in the performances of O’Shea and Scott. Maybe I caught this on the wrong night. I thought O'Shea was very good and Stevens is certainly a writer to look out for. Her earlier play, Thin Toes, was also complex and interesting, but I found this production pretty sluggish in places and didn't quite buy some of the characters' reactions."
976,976,Ought To Be Clowns,02/07/2013,Ian,The Forbidden, Radio 4,"Just a quickie for this as I hadn’t intended to blog it but it has lingered long in the memory to merit a recommendation. Clive Barker’s 1985 novella formed the inspiration for the 1992 horror film Candyman but Duncan MacMillan’s modernised adaptation of The Forbidden for Radio 4 takes it back to its British roots, finding the modern-day creepiness inherent in rundown council estates populated by riot-happy hordes. Helen’s sleep is frequently disturbed by a recurring nightmare that takes her back to a basement in her old home and a mysterious unidentified presence always alongside her. As she moves into a new place which is in the same area with her ever-patient husband Trevor, she sets about trying to get to the bottom of her dreams but is unprepared for the truth that is buried deep in her subconscious."
977,977,Ought To Be Clowns,30/10/2015,mag9l,Joanne, Soho Theatre,"Clean Break have often come to the Soho Theatre to showcase their work in London (the Charged season a great example) and so it’s little surprise to see them return with Joanne, five mini-plays weaving around the titular character, a woman struggling with life we never meet but whose presence is fiercely felt. All five monologues are performed by the one actor, the excellent Tanya Moodie, and detail the experience of people working in the system that is failing Joanne. So Chino Odimba’s Stella sees the social worker made redundant, celebrating at her leaving do rather than thinking of the girl she met on release from prison that morning. Ursula Rani Sarma and Deborah Bruce introduce respectively a police officer and an A&E receptionist who despite their kind-hearted intentions, can’t quite manage to give Joanne the help they know she so desperately needs, their frustrations at an overworked system most palpable. Theresa Ikoko gives us the more brutal reality of Alice, qualified with an MBA but only able to get a job as an operations manager at a hostel, her bitterness blinding her to the people around her. And Laura Lomas lastly breaking hearts with the teacher whose lack of intervention at a crucial earlier age had severe repercussions. Tied together by Moodie’s sterling performance, they’re a fascinating combination, each exploring the nature of responsibility to others."
978,978,Ought To Be Clowns,14/05/2012,Ian,Steel Magnolias, Richmond Theatre,"The prospect of a stage version of Steel Magnolias, populated by a motley crew of British actresses from stage and screen, filled me with equally with dread and anticipation as I am a big fan of the film (one of Julia Roberts’ best performances). But curiosity won the day and for my first trip back to the theatre after a trip away, I made my way to Richmond Theatre to be transported to 1980s Louisiana and delve into the trials and tribulations of Truvy, M’Lynn, Shelby and co. Robert Harling’s story was originally a play (sadly inspired by the death of his sister) and though the expanded action of the film may be more familiar, the play’s limitation to Helen Goddard’s perfectly 80’s-hued beauty parlour across four acts is structurally sound and works extremely well. This salon forms a gathering place for six women and over a period of three years, we see the ebb and flow of life and how the mutually supportive atmosphere helps all of them in one way or another as they variously look for and selflessly give strength to one another.  The joy here is in the vivaciousness of the characters and my fears were unfounded as the company largely rose to the challenge and delivered some excellent performances. Kacey Ainsworth as the newly arrived and rather suggestible Annelle plays out her journey with great sensitivity; Cherie Lunghi is perfect as the deliciously gay-friendly Clairee and sparks off Cheryl Campbell’s warmly eccentric Ouiser with great chemistry and affection; and Denise Welch was a revelation, a timely reminder of her beginnings as an actress, as a softly-spoken but endearingly wise Truvy. The drama comes from the determination of young Shelby to have a child, against the advice of her doctors and her mother M’Lynn, as she is diabetic. Knowing the story, I thought the foreshadowing was done extremely well with several goose-bump-inducing moments; for those that don’t, take tissues. Isla Blair’s dignified, devastatingly moving performance as M’Lynn is sensational, especially in the highly affecting final act, that Sadie Pickering’s Shelby is sometimes a little overshadowed, never feeling quite as relaxed or as natural with her accent. But her notes of youthful exuberance largely provide a great counter-balance to the advanced years of most of those around her. David Gilmour’s production is relatively unfussy, largely eschewing directorial tricks but contriving to unnecessarily highlight somewhat extended scene changes with clunky music tracks. These are assumably to account for the considerable costume and wig changes but it is fortunate the play is as good as it is as they would otherwise severely try the patience. But good it is, funny and moving in the right places and stuffed full of great performances. I don't know which play you saw, but the performance I saw at Richmond last Friday bears no resemblance to this review! The actresses did not engage with the audience, there was a singular lack of emotion and connection with each other and quite frankly I couln't have cared less which character died! The accents were 'off' with Ms Welch slipping into pure Coronation Street every now and then. A poor performance. BIRMINGHAM REP 22ND MAY 2012Totally agree with the previous comment.  Very disappointed. Most boring show I have ever seen.  No emotion and so stilted it was unbelievable.  Shame really with the amount of talent that was on the stage."
979,979,Ought To Be Clowns,19/09/2009,Ian,Mother Courage and her Children, National,"It is a fairly lengthy beast, the first half alone is two hours long, but neither I nor my companion felt that it dragged at all, I found the songs kept it quite pacey, and felt much the same during the second half (a mere hour long). There wasn’t that high a level of dropout after the interval which was quite nice to see and there was a strong reception for the players at the end. Much has been made of the introduction of Duke Special and his band but I have to say I thought by and large it worked. Personally, I was not as keen on the rockier numbers, despite Shaw gamely rocking out, but was genuinely moved by some of the slower numbers, especially when he was duetting with other characters. Fiona Shaw is excellent as the titular Mother Courage, dominating the stage with her very presence, and she is onstage for the vast majority of the play. She has a great physicality in the role, culminating in her dragging her cart around by herself, and she was clearly having a ball onstage. Stephen Kennedy as the Chaplain was very good, all the more so, given that he was a late addition to the cast, replacing someone else. He ought to pull his trousers up though, I may have been entirely clear on when the play was meant to be set, but I’m pretty sure 2(x)ist underpants weren’t around in them days and we saw an awful lot of them! Sophie Stone as the mute Kattrin is also impressive with an expressive, nuanced physical performance which Harry Melling (Swiss Cheese) might do well to take a little note of, his array of tics and twitches felt a little gratuitous at times. As this was a preview, most things could be forgiven, there does need to be some considerable work on maintaining good sound levels but I am sure things are in hand. Otherwise I would say at a tenner, this is well worth a evening of your time. Nice review. It's a great production and I'm looking forward to seeing it again."
980,980,Ought To Be Clowns,17/09/2016,mag9l,Young Chekhov – Platonov, National,"Platonov wasn’t performed in Chekhov’s lifetime and even in this radically adapted version by David Hare, I’m not 100% sure that it works. You can see the attraction in terms of the Young Chekhov context – a trilogy of the Russian’s early work – but for me, the main pleasure comes in seeing the benchmark from which his later genius advanced. It’s not for lack of trying from Jonathan Kent’s production, lead by a sparkling performance of disreputable charisma from James McArdle as an unhappily married teacher intent on spreading his vodka-fuelled discontent through the bedsheets of most of the local community, not least Nina Sosanya’s Anna and Olivia Vinall’s Sofya, with little care for the impact of his actions."
981,981,Ought To Be Clowns,02/06/2010,Ian,Joe Turner’s Come and Gone, Young Vic,"First things first: there’s a credit in the programme for teeth by Fangs FX but I was sorely disappointed not to notice where these came in and this set my mood for the whole show. Joe Turner’s Come and Gone is a play by August Wilson which forms part of a cycle of plays looking at the African-American experience in the twentieth century. It appears here in London at the Young Vic until the 3rd July. Set in 1911, Seth and Bertha run a boarding house in Pittsburgh filled an array of characters who drift in and out, some for days, some for weeks, all dealing with the new post-emancipation world they find themselves in. The gentle atmosphere is rocked with the arrival of Herald Loomis and his daughter Zonia. Herald has spent seven years in slavery to a white planter named Joe Turner and is seeking his wife Martha, who disappeared four years ago from their home in Tennessee. He is a menacing half-mad presence and the other boarders deal with him in various ways as people coming to terms with their own experiences too. It just didn’t work for me though. The auditorium has been reconfigured fully in the round which means, despite the giant queues to get into the theatre, you’d think that there’s hardly a bad seat in the house for once. However, the direction has not really fully grasped the opportunities offered by the staging, and indeed the necessities of expertly choreographed blocking: from my seat, practically every scene had someone’s back in front of me barely moving throughout, thereby hampering any involvement I might have hoped to have. There’s some delights on the acting front: Adjoa Andoh is superb as the warm motherly Bertha, taking strays under her wing and guiding them back onto their path with a maternal love (I have a special place in my heart for Andoh ever since she personified Serafina Pekkala to perfection), Delroy Lindo (who was in the original Broadway cast in 1987 in a different role) is towering as Bynum who proves more of a spiritual guide for the residents. Nathaniel Martello-White has been a bit of a revelation for me this year with two great performances at the Arcola in Innocence and Knives in Hens and he doesn’t disappoint here either with the laconic Jeremy, as charming and likeable a womaniser as ever you will meet. But still I did not find the connection to the material that I needed. There was too much shouting from the likes of Kobna Holdbrook-Smith and Danny Sapani as Herald and Seth where there could have been colour and subtlety and the character of Seth epitomised the main problem I had with the play. If he is so uninterested in the story of Herald then why should I be? His constant hectoring in the play was like a thorn in my side, constantly reminding me that I wasn’t enjoying this or caring much about what happened. The stage and the whole floor is covered in red dirt and I mean every bit of the floor from the moment you step in (plastic bags are provided if you don’t want to put your nice bag onto the dirt), its a random touch which works on the stage but less so in covering your feet with the stuff, and it is must be a nightmare on a wet day. The lighting from Mike Gunning is nicely atmospheric but with some additional touches which range from the frankly odd choice of ultraviolet rays ending the first half to the quirky arch of lights which periodically runs from end to end."
982,982,Ought To Be Clowns,05/06/2017,Ian,Annie, Piccadilly,"With a singing style that is as strong as Theresa May’s record on supporting the police and an accent that is as stable as the content of her manifesto, it’s a bold move to make Miranda Hart the above the title star of this production of Annie, the first in London this millennium. To be fair though, unlike May she’s willing to work well with others, gamely throwing herself into harmonies and hoofing around in vaudevillean-style routines, but her performance is too close to the warmth of her TV persona to ever really convince of the darkness at the heart of Miss Hannigan. Equally, it’s hard to feel that the West End is in real need of Annie and all its old-fashioned ways. Nikolai Foster’s production, seen on tour in the UK over the last year, has its certain charm but it is hard to get excited by any of it. Colin Richmond’s jigsaw puzzle of a set design misguidedly evokes thoughts of Matilda when in reality there’s nothing that fresh about it; Nick Winston’s choreography similarly promises much but ends up reaching for traditional touchpoints which end up underwhelming with the relatively small company at hand here, as evidenced in the small scale of ‘N.Y.C.’. Part of the problem may well lie with me. I’ve never seen the show onstage before and though it may not have been the most well-received of remakes but I admired the ambition behind the 2014 film adaptation, particularly Sia and Gregg Kurstin’s rearrangements of the score by composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Martin Charnin. Here, there’s no invention or flair to the way the music has been interpreted (ironically, you can buy the film’s soundtrack on CD in the concession booth) and on press night, I have to say there was a real muddiness that got in the way of a fair amount of lyrical clarity."
983,983,Ought To Be Clowns,08/12/2013,Ian,Let The Right One In, Royal Court,"Adapted by Jack Thorne from John Ajvide Lindqvist’s novel and its two subsequent film versions, Let The Right One In could be said to fall into the teen vampire genre that has proved so enduringly popular of late, but that would do a huge disservice to all concerned, not least with this National Theatre of Scotland and Royal Court co-production. As two youngsters neglected by society cling onto each other to avoid falling through the cracks in a snow-swept Swedish town where a serial killer appears to be on the loose, they discover that one is not quite like the other… Directed by John Tiffany with long-time associate Steven Hoggett by his side, the show produces moment after moment of elegiac beauty interspersed with the harsh brutality of real life which intrudes like jagged breaths of wintry air. Hoggett’s unmistakeable physical language is sparingly but beautifully deployed, the strangeness of situation enhanced through movement and Ólafur Arnalds’ score swoops with plangent intensity, underscoring many of the show’s most powerful sequences. Accompanied by Gareth Fry’s evocative sound design, the production constantly teeters on an anticipatory edge, toying with the film’s horror origins but converting it to a more fitting level of suspense for the stage. Tiffany admirably maintains this level throughout in Christine Jones’ bleak forest set, sparing us none of the details, whether the fear of drowning, the horrific hiss of acid, the visceral gushes of blood or slightly less gorily, the authentically Swedish collection of confectionery on offer. And the young teenagers at the heart of the tale, Rebecca Benson’s Eli captures perfectly the otherworldly intonations of someone isolated from the world and as Martin Quinn’s Oskar has all the schoolboy naïveté of somebody equally cloistered, but equally ready to make that emotional connection."
984,984,Ought To Be Clowns,21/09/2016,mag9l,Dedication – Shakespeare and Southampton, Nuffield,"Nuffield’s commissioning of new writing that is connected to the area has long been impressive (I still remember The Saints most fondly) and continues with Nick Dear’s new play Dedication – Shakespeare and Southampton, their contribution to the Shakespeare400 celebrations. The Southampton here though is Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd Earl of Southampton, rather than the place and the subject of the play, a dramatised fantasia on what lengths to which their relationship might have entailed. All we know for sure is that Shakespeare dedicated two narrative poems to him – Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece – and from these slim pickings, Dear imagines three competing, but not necessarily contradictory scenarios which are played out simultaneously. The patron in pursuit of artistic excellence or personal fame, the playwright seduced by the prospect of a bulging purse or simply the bulge in his pants. a pair of contemporaries locked together in swordplay or gay lovers dancing a pavane (great movement work from Siân Williams). Using the framing device of a trial for high treason (Wriothesley was charged with, and found guilty of, plotting against Elizabeth I) and thus called to explain his relationship to the man, Dear – through Shakespeare – is able to explore this idea of the mutability of history, how it changes according to the stories we want to tell or indeed we want to hide – one of the Wriothesleys is a cross-dressing aesthete and not a one of the timelines isn’t dripping with charged homoeroticism (when they’re not outright doing it, that is).  Over its not-quite-90-minutes, Dedication also emerges as a fascinating study both of what it means to be a patron of the arts and what it means to accept patronage, the range of impacts on both sides of the coin. and director Samuel Hodges is clearly alive to that. It is also determined to unshackle the story from the past – “it’s not a history play” – and the production is slightly less-sure-footed here. The Nuffield has been converted into the round and Alex Lowde’s shinily black contraption of spinning frames outlined in neon distracts as much as it demarcates the different worlds of the play. Thus it feels like Tom McKay and Tom Rhys Harries are having to battle the set at times but when things are running smoothly, both give powerful performances. McKay’s Shakespeare all personality and pragmatism, Rhys Harries’ fluctuating Wriothesley convincing in all three iterations, the fluidity of sexual identity brilliantly essayed by both, especially in the tender, unspoken moments of the final montage. "
985,985,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2013,Ian,Mare Rider, Arcola,"Leyla Nazli co-founded the Arcola with Mehmet Ergen in 2000 and it was here that her first play, Silver Birch House, was directed by Ergen to considerable acclaim in 2007. And with her new play Mare Rider, her writing returns to the Dalston theatre, directed by Ergen again and featuring a highly seductive cast including Kathryn Hunter and Anna Francolini. The Mare Rider is full of mystery, a bad spirit named Elka, reputed to haunt new mothers and as Selma goes through a troublesome birth at Homerton Hospital, the two women take a journey of haunting revelation that hinges somewhere between fantasy and tragedy. Elka is the kind of role Hunter revels in inhabiting. A mythical figure from Turkish fairytales, there’s a strong vein of mordant humour in her stories of her own rebellious long-gone past in which her struggle for independence was subverted to make her an enemy of her own society and thus a monstrous legend was born. She’s also a highly fantastical figure and her tales of adventure frequently possess a magical quality, something conjured excellent by Richard Williamson’s lighting and video design from Ben Walden and Dick Straker and of course, Hunter’s own sinuous physicality, whether stamping out a tribal dance, aggressively flipping beds or riding a horse across the Anatolian plain. And then there’s Francolini’s Selma, the epitome of contemporary womanhood but as her freedom to choose is directly contrasted with Elka’s lack thereof in her own youth, Nazli subtly makes the point that she’s not necessarily as free as she might think. As Elka stalks Selma’s subconscious as her body lies recovering from a traumatic childbirth, she pushes forth the idea that her choices to pursue her career and have a late pregnancy are as much a product of societal pressure as Elka’s own. Francolini has a wonderful wildness to her nature as Selma, her nationality is never stated but one is tempted to draw connections between the two women as their stridency does seem intrinsically linked.  Unlike the forever patrolling Mare Rider though, Selma isn’t alone, she is married. And Nazli works in the character of Mark, her lawyer husband, with a delicate sensitivity, acknowledging the strains of living with such a tempestuously vibrant personality but also the great joy it has to bring too. The show’s highlight is in a most elegantly structured scene where Selma is forced to watch a distraught Mark unburden himself to Hara Yannas’ compassionate nurse as she can only respond to the shadowy Elka, this couple finding it easier to deconstruct their relationship to strangers as communication between them is just too difficult."

987,987,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2015,mag9l,Blood, Soho Theatre,"From deliciously awkward beginnings involving self-penned rap, Nando’s hot sauce and shisha pipes, it is clear that college students Caneze and Sully have got a definite spark going on as their teenage passion ignites. But whether in Shakespeare’s fair Verona or this Midlands Pakistani community, family is the thing and her mother and over-protective older brother with his gang connections are dead set against the relationship. So what do they do? They meet in secret, Sully sneaking into Caneze’s bedroom through the window like a wannabe Romeo.   Emteaz Hussain’s Blood is a co-production from Tamasha and Coventry’s Belgrade theatre and is a striking two-hander, inspired by Romeo and Juliet but forging its own path through the complex maze of family and community ties both in the UK and Pakistan, trying to force our young lovers into age-old predefined notions of marriage, religion, duty. Written in a free-flowing mix of Mirjuri-Punjabi and English, Hussain delivers an utterly convincing world of youth speak and yet one in which understanding is never sacrificed for authenticity.  Credit for this clarity also goes to director Esther Richardson who gives us a pared-back production which allows for the emotional literacy to really shine. With just Krupa Pattani’s intense Caneze and Adam Samuel-Bal’s lanky Sully on stage, the power to conjure the external world against which they are fighting lies largely in the expression of their internal monologues and it is very well done. Samuel-Bal shows off prodigious comic skills in impersonating his Pakistani relatives and Pattani is just spell-binding as the walls of her family’s vigilance close in. "
988,988,Ought To Be Clowns,27/03/2013,Ian,The Low Road, Royal Court,"*This review is a bit spoilerific so don’t read on if you don’t want aspects of the play, and others, to be revealed to you*  When people ask me to describe the plot of a play, I almost always end it with “…and then the aliens arrive” because that’s the way my mind works and generally speaking, it’s a safe assumption that the playwright won’t have gone there. So imagine my surprise when they actually arrived in the second act of Salad Days, it was like all my Christmases at once and because of the daffy silliness of the whole shebang, it was able to pull it off. Working in similarly offbeat surprises into straight drama is perhaps a more difficult job though and one which arguably has to work harder to make a success of it. The scope of Bruce Norris’ new play The Low Road would seem to preclude the need for such an approach. A sprawlingly epic trawl through the growth of our (western) economic system told through the fable-like tale of Jim, an entrepreneurial young man roaming through an 18th century America whose single-minded financial knowledge and ambition prefigures the capitalist mind-set that is so familiar to us today. A post-interval modern-day interlude draws explicit parallels and connections between the actions and attitudes of now and then to reinforce its main thesis about the triumph of individualism. Oh, and there’s an epilogue. My previous experience of Norris’ writing (limited to Clybourne Park and Purple Heart) has seen him conceive tensely coiled dramas spilling out of the domestic sphere but this is altogether grander and is somewhat reminiscent of the jump in Mike Bartlett’s work (comparing say, Cock to 13) both in the expansion of his viewpoint but also in the bagginess that has accompanied his arguments in the leap. For this is a overlong piece and one which rarely justifies the length of its set pieces – most often interminable discussions on some element of economic or financial theory over various dinner tables – or indeed its excursions into the unconventional. It is clear from the off that the playwright is toying with the form a little, assisted by Dominic Cooke, directing what is his swansong as he prepares to leave the Artistic Directorship of this theatre. The first figure we see is Bill Paterson who takes on the role of noted economist Adam Smith who is the narrator of the story; Brechtian captions are carried across the stage to move us from location to location as the pieces of Tom Pye’s deconstructed design are pieced and repieced together; the G8-style panel discussion sees an entirely different shift in tone as the already hard-working ensemble take on yet another role in the giddy whirl of characters populating this world. But it feels largely overindulgent and somewhat ineffective for all the effort it expends. The arguments of the play, as already mentioned, are extremely drawn out, killing any sense of pace that might be built up and little sense of purpose ever really emerges from the writing. The sharp edge of his wit never really comes through and instead some scenes are laced with almost Tarantino-esque levels of provocation over race or disability which bait audiences rather than helping them to explore these issues. "
989,989,Ought To Be Clowns,30/11/2016,mag9l,The Children, Royal Court,"It’s interesting to see the things that make ruffles in the theatrical establishment and those which pass by without comment. Vicky Featherstone’s reign at the Royal Court has not been without its uneven moments but the fact that The Children will be followed on the main stage by the return of Escaped Alone is indicative both of the daring nature of her programming in forefronting stories about older people, and also its success. Lucy Kirkwood’s new play further ups the ante in making her protagonists sexual beings, her trio of retired scientists are battling not only the fallout from nuclear disaster but from the collision of their emotional lives. Nearly 40 years ago, Hazel and Rose were rivals for Robin and the play opens with the two women seeing each other for the first time since then. It’s a stilted, strange encounter, further complicated by Robin’s arrival.  For though Hazel may not have seen Rose, it seems like her husband has seen his former lover more recently. And combined with the realities of living on the edge of a nuclear disaster zone, Kirkwood thus explores probing questions about generational responsibility, placing questions about the legacy that we leave for those to come against the value of living one’s life to the fullest regardless of the consequences. James Macdonald’s production percolates slowly without ever really coming to the boil, but once you’re adjusted to the slightly off-kilter (literally so, in Miriam Buether’s set) and eerie atmosphere, there’s much to enjoy. Francesca Annis and Deborah Findlay contrast marvelously as the free-flowing Rose and the uptight Hazel, irrevocably connected by Ron Cook’s likable Robin – drunken dancing has never seemed quite so much fun, even on parsnip wine. The debate the play provokes is fiercely thought-through, holding baby boomers up to the light and finding them wanting (in a similar way to Bartlett’s Love Love Love) and there’s something admirable about the surefootedness of Kirkwood’s position, as uncompromising as it might seem. Definitely one to see and mull over – how far would you go for The Children?"
990,990,Ought To Be Clowns,17/07/2014,mag9l,Medea, National Theatre,"Euripides’ Medea has long been considered one of the greatest roles for a woman to play so it is a little surprising (or perhaps not) that it hasn’t been performed at the National Theatre before. But the winds of change blow even on the South Bank so it makes great sense that one of our finest living actresses, Helen McCrory, should take on the part in a production by Carrie Cracknell, herself responsible for making some of that change with recent shows like A Doll’s House and Blurred Lines. Ben Power’s new version relocates the betrayed Medea in a blasted contemporary setting (another ingeniously cracking design from Tom Scutt, evocatively lit by Lucy Carter) where she and her two children anxiously await news of the husband and father who has abandoned them for a newly politically expedient marriage. Trapped in a foreign land, having severely burned her bridges with her homeland, we watch helplessly along with a hefty Greek Chorus as grief inexorably transmutes into anger.  Cracknell has collaborated most interestingly cross-discipline in her production. The electro-organic score by Will Gregory and Alison Goldfrapp pulses and builds through the production most effectively, moments of choral singing portend ominously like storm clouds. These swells of music also hold the Chorus in their sway physically, Lucy Guerin’s choreography being used in a couple of striking visual sequences whose jerky movements seem set to divide audiences. I rather liked the theatrical effect it provided, suggesting perhaps a touch of divine or at least mystical manipulation. The 13-strong Chorus, replete with dancers such as Yuyu Ra, Clemmie Sveaas and Naomi Tadevossian as well as more familiar faces (to me) like Lorna Brown and Jane Wymark, speaks of something of the luxury casting here, like bringing in the lusciously bearded Dominic Rowan for what is little more than a cameo as Athenian king Aegeus. Martin Turner’s Kreon and Toby Wharton as a sympathetic attendant register strongly in their scenes though Danny Sapani’s gruffly distant Jason might do a little more to fully breathe as a character. And Michaela Coel’s searchingly compassionate nurse is a triumph, continuing a superb year for her.  For all else pales alongside McCrory’s excoriating presence as Medea, her rage and fury never far from the surface yet clearly much more dangerous when calm and still. Unafraid, even desperate, to use whatever she can to escape her fate, cold wheels of calculation are ever-turning in her mind, guiding her every action so that it’s never entirely clear when she is being genuine, indeed the all-encompassing nature of her shell-shocked self as McCrory plays it, means she might not even know herself. In a week when the gender (im)balance of the cabinet reshuffle has focused on so many of the wrong things, it is clear why Medea has endured as an undeniable classic. The presence of women in the political sphere was, and still is, a challenge to so many and Cracknell’s astutely updated production reminds us that though we have come some way, there is still much further to go – won’t somebody think of the children… "

992,992,Ought To Be Clowns,05/05/2011,Ian,Kingdom of Earth, The Print Room,"Terence Rattigan has received a lot of attention in his centenary year with productions of his shows filling theatres across the land, but it is also the anniversary of Tennessee Williams’ 100th birthday this year which has been generally marked by much more low-key productions of his lesser-known works, including this 1968 work Kingdom of Earth which is presented at the West London venue The Print Room. Set in the 1960s in an isolated ruined farmhouse in the Mississippi Delta, a sick young man Lot returns to his birthplace with his new wife, showgirl Myrtle. But he arrives to find that there is a huge impending flood about to engulf the region and his estranged half-brother Chicken is living in the house. As Lot retires to the comfort of his mother’s old bedroom and wardrobe and his illness takes a turn for the worse, Chicken seizes the chance to ensure that his legacy and claim to the family property is not affected by the presence of his rival’s new wife. Myrtle is thus caught in the power struggle between these brothers as they battle for ownership, and not just of the house. The flexibility of the space in The Print Room is clearly going to be one of its key selling points: Ruth Sutcliffe’s design here creating the dilapidated farmhouse feel from a few pieces of broken furniture scattered over a mound of earth in one corner of the auditorium, the ceiling continually leaking and the sounds of the tempestuous weather never far away. It makes for a highly atmospheric scenario and the precariousness of Myrtle’s journey up and down the muddy hill, in heels, cleverly echoes the trickiness of her situation, poised between these two half-brothers. Williams’ writing is rather typical here, there’s no great surprises and it is very much part of his canon with recognisable archetypes and themes all over the show. But it remains powerful and moving stuff, leavened by some nicely comic moments and an aching sexuality, all of which are served beautifully by the cast of three. The salacious language drips off David Sturzaker’s tongue as Chicken: “Don’t you like a man-sized instrument?” he leerily enquires at one point and he’s even to be found pleasuring himself downstage whilst a scene plays up top between Myrtle and Lot. He is a virile presence who commands the stage and as he seeks to gain possession, of both the house and Myrtle, it is hard to resist his masculine charms. Joseph Drake, fresh from his accomplished stage debut in Vernon God Little and the news of his casting in the Chichester Rattigan’s Nijinsky and The Deep Blue Sea, shows a real maturity as the deeply ill, transvestite-leaning and camp Southern gentleman Lot. But Fiona Glascott as Myrtle is the one working almost constantly throughout the show, whether tending to her sick husband atop the muddy mound or dancing around the negotiations and heavily sexual flirtations with his half-brother downstairs. She’s a woman all-too-aware of her position and what needs to be done in order to secure it, and there’s a canniness to her that Glascott portrays beautifully, even in her most vulnerable moments, as she employs her strongest assets to manipulate Chicken where she needs him. Altogether a fitting centenary celebration of a playwright who one feels really ought to be getting more attention this year. So what exactly is ""scenes of a sexual nature""? Just enough to make it a 15-rating, ie not for children."
993,993,Ought To Be Clowns,31/10/2015,mag9l,As You Like It, National Theatre,"For regular theatregoers, it can sometimes feel a bit hard to get excited about the umpteenth production of a play, so much so that I almost didn’t see the winning combination of the much-loved Blanche McIntyre and Michelle Terry until the very end of their run at the Globe this summer. So the news that Polly Findlay was also tackling As You Like It for the National was tempered a little (though it is the first time in 30 years it has played there) but as Rosalind was announced (Rosalie Craig poached from the cast of wonder.land to replace an indisposed Andrea Riseborough), the excitement began to build and the inevitable ticket was purchased and boy am I glad that I did.  For the transformation of the set into the Forest of Arden is a moment of genuinely breath-taking theatre, Lizzie Clachan pulling the rug from under us and her design to create a most singular vision. And it is one in which enchantment slowly grows with sylvan sound effects created by company members onstage and a choir singing Orlando Gough’s contemporary and complex score (akin if alike to the one he composed for Bakkhai). There’s a lovely conceit in which Alan Williams’ Corins, nominally a shepherd but here more like a forest deity, summons the music every time love is needed to cast its spell, enhancing the magical feel. Which is all the more impressive given where we start. Duke Frederick’s court is transposed to a corporate bullpen full of trader types, his duchy a bustling business empire (with wrestling amusingly posed as a 5pm distraction) from whence Rosalind and Patsy Ferran’s Celia are duly banished, but not before the former has tumbled head over heels for the equally tongue-tied Orlando, a marvellously puppyish Joe Bannister. And once all are in the forest, the transformative power of love takes hold as Rosalind disguises herself as Ganymede in order to test Orlando’s mettle and Craig and Bannister’s excellent chemistry takes flight. "
994,994,Ought To Be Clowns,13/06/2012,Ian,The Comedy of Errors, RSC at the Roundhouse,"The endless whirl of festivals continues apace with the return of the RSC to its adopted London home at the Roundhouse. As part of the World Shakespeare Festival, which in turn is part of the London 2012 Festival, the RSC’s Shipwreck Trilogy brings together one company and two directors over three plays which are bound together through their similarities, entitled What Country Friends Is This?. First up is Palestinian director Amir Nizar Zuabi’s take on The Comedy of Errors, a fresh and frenetic romp through the play which, whilst it may lack some poetry, has been invested with a great energy. Ruled over by a maniacal gun-toting Duke, it is instantly clear that this Ephesus is a dangerous place in which the threat of death is ever-present and a genuine reality. Onto a grim looking quayside, Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse are deposited as illegal immigrants in the elusive search for their twin brothers from whom they were separated in a shipwreck. Unbeknownst to them, they’ve alighted in the right place but almost immediately they are mistaken for their Ephesan brothers and brings into motion a hectic tale of misunderstandings and madcap capers. Nizar Zuabi has woven in an unmistakeably dark strand of thought into this production but though a constant presence, it rarely makes its presence deeply felt (initial water torture aside). Instead, it is the physical comedy that rises to the forefront, led by two excellent performances from Felix Hayes and Bruce MacKinnon as the Dromios, clearly of a pair but neatly differentiated too in their varying relations with their masters. Jonathan McGuinness and Stephen Hagan as the Antipholuses (Antipholi?) were more of the straight men against these performances though still strong in a large ensemble which swirled effectively across and around the stage. At times, it does feel like the compression of the play has reduced the impact of some of the supporting characters, though Jonathan Slinger’s grim, electrode-wielding Pinch stands out. But one further pleasing result of the cuts is to foreground the character of Adriana more than usual in this man-heavy play, and if Kirsty Bushell perhaps plays the shrieking harridan card a little too strongly at times, it is never less than entirely watchable, especially when counterpointed by Emily Taaffe’s sweeter Luciana. Jon Bausor’s staging, cranes are obviously his theme for the year following on from his Open Air Theatre design, makes inventive use of the space and the suspension of Adriana’s salon in the air is inspired. And the cumulative impact of the production is one which proves successful. Undoubtedly, there have been funnier examples (Propeller), ones with greater emotional impact (the National Theatre’s final scene) and there have been others which paid more thorough attention to the verse-speaking, but those three elements are still present here and skilfully combined to rambunctious, raucous effect.        "
995,995,Ought To Be Clowns,31/10/2012,Ian,NSFW, Royal Court,"I’m rarely lost for an opinion, but I am struggling to decide what I really thought of Lucy Kirkwood’s new play for the Royal Court, the search-term-baiting NSFW (not safe for work). In its 80 minutes, it rips through the way in which magazine industry portrays its images of women from two wildly differing perspectives, both equally entertaining but troubling. But after the attitudes from both ends of the spectrum are laid bare in all their misogynistic glory, the play ends rather than delving deeper into the world that allows this to happen. The journey there is interesting and insightful, even if I didn’t find it quite as funny as some of those around me (it is actually billed as a “timely new comedy”). In the garishly decorated offices of weekly lad’s mag Doghouse, a huge topless picture of Carrie – their Local Lovely 2012 – is given pride of place to celebrate an upturn in circulation. The mood quickly sinks though as it emerges that Carrie is just 14 and is unaware that her photo was submitted by her boyfriend and a serious damage limitation exercise is instituted.  Kirkwood astutely points out the impossibility of stereotyping the people behind the scenes, as in a world where print journalism is constantly under threat, any job as a journalist will serve the purpose, no matter what the title. So under Julian Barratt’s uneasily shifting editor, a mixture of blokish forced affability desperately trying to be hip and a predatory business-oriented mind unafraid of tearing an outraged father to shreds, there’s a surprising mixture of budding writers, including Henry Lloyd Hughes’ Sloaney trustafarian and Esther Smith’s bright young Charlotte, who lies to her feminist friends about where she works, a job is a job and they can each rationalise their decision to work there. And trying to make the best of a bad job, they close ranks in hideous self-justification, divorcing themselves of all responsibility and blaming the culture. We then get a different take on that same culture as we switch to the much more elegant surroundings of Electra, a women’s weekly (but not Women’s Weekly!), 9 months down the line. Sam, an intern who lost his job at Doghouse as the one responsible for the boob about the boobs, is having a job interview with editor Miranda (not Priestley), Janie Dee in fabulous full-on glamazon mode. Desperate for the work, he submits himself to the task that she sets of identifying the many ‘imperfections’ in a picture of a famous actress and when he can’t, or won’t, do it, she probes deep into his personal life to get him to do the same with the idealised image of the now-departed love of his life to prove to him that no woman is perfect. Sacha Dhawan plays Sam perfectly, weighing up his conscience against the need to work (even if he isn’t quite the image of the working class boy specified in the text) and the irony inherent in the attitudes at this new place is bitterly held, especially with the final image of the show, and buzzes with contemporary resonance.  "
996,996,Ought To Be Clowns,28/05/2016,mag9l,Folk, Watford Palace,"One day, Tom Wells will start writing about something other than misfits in the East Riding of Yorkshire but until he does, we’re still being blessed with minor-key gems like Folk (after Jumpers for Goalposts, The Kitchen Sink, and Me, As A Penguin), reaching the end of its tour here in this co-production between Birmingham Repertory Theatre , Hull Truck Theatre and Watford Palace Theatre. From the front room of her Withernsea home, Irish nun Winnie has been subtly changing the world for those around her. Her sweary, spoon-playing ways have long been complemented by Stephen, a mournful musical middle-aged man who counts her as his only friend and when the teenage Kayleigh comes crashing into their lives, it is music that proves the force that slowly bonds them together. There isn’t too much more story than that to be honest but with Wells, that really doesn’t matter a great deal. The pleasure in his writing comes in its subtleties and observational humour rather than great dramatic swoops, and as we come to know this trio better, discovering what the folk music that connects them actually represents to them personally, Folk builds into something most affecting."
997,997,Ought To Be Clowns,28/05/2016,mag9l,After Independence, Arcola,"The Papatango Theatre Company have long been at the forefront of new writing with their annual prize competition always one to look out for and now they’re expanding their territory, premiering a new piece from their first Resident Playwright here at the Arcola. Edinburgh-born May Sumbwanyambe’s family hails from right across Southern Africa and it is there, specifically, Zimbabwe, to which he has turned for After Independence. Set at the end of the last century when a majority black government first came to power in Harare, the play circles the contentious issue of land grabs, as white farmers and landowners have their property redistributed – sometimes forcefully – to the black population. But though their claims look to the future, they deny the past of a population who consider themselves just as African, and thus the horns of a terrible dilemma present themselves. In the midst of Max Dorey’s imaginative sun-bleached design, Stefan Adegbola’s government man Mr Charles thus does battle with Peter Guinness’ aching old soul and a fearsome Beatriz Romilly as his much more exercised daughter Chipo. The scenes tend to play out as two-handers in a remarkably even-handed manner, demonstrating the impossibility of the situation – generations of hurt on both sides, no easy answers in sight."
998,998,Ought To Be Clowns,17/10/2019,Ian,Tickle the Musical, King’s Head Theatre,"I probably shouldn’t admit this but I am extremely ticklish, to the point where even looking at someone getting tickled sends a little shiver down my spine. So naturally I booked in to see a musical about competitive enduance tickling (it’s a thing – I’d say google it, at your own peril…) but at a safe distance from any of the feather dusters lurking on the stage. Chris Burgess’ Tickle the Musical proves to be a rather good-natured, sweet thing that wisely takes itself not at all seriously and is all the more effective for it. A feather-light plot sees smalltown boys Chris and Callum offered fame and fortune (well, five hundred quid) by the calculating Davina Diamond to tickle each other on film, for her website – what on earth could go wrong?! After a slightly slow beginning, Robert McWhir’s production launches into life once it leans properly into its inherent campness. As Davina declares that two fit lads in short shorts tickling each other isn’t gay in ‘It’s Not Gay’, tongues are placed firmly in cheeks and the homoeroticism is allowed to soar off the chart. By the time we’re at the tickling world championship, you really will be asking what would Julie Andrews do…
  Burgess’ attractively tuneful score packs in 17 numbers into its action-packed hour and an up-for-it cast deliver it well under David Eaton’s musical direction. James McDowall and Ben Brooker generate a real chemistry as the tickling twosome with the kind of pleasingly robust male friendship you don’t see too often. Richard Watkins’ Tina Tickle is wonderfully unpredictable (she’s right, you can’t tickle yourself) and I was seriously impressed with Amy Sutton’s Davina, strong vocals and electric stage presence, she’s one to watch out for. So it’s all really rather good fun, slotting in nicely to the King’s Head’s late slot and wrapping up long before you’ll be wanting to cry out ‘enough’. "
999,999,Ought To Be Clowns,01/06/2011,Ian,Butley, Duchess Theatre,"The best laid plans oft gang aft and having pretty much decided not to bother with the Simon Gray play Butley, opening now at the Duchess Theatre, as I have been trying (and admittedly failing) to try and cut down on the amount of theatre I’m seeing, sure enough an offer I could not refuse popped up (courtesy of @bargaintheatre – a chap well worth a follow on Twitter for his ferreting around for some great deals) and so 10 English pounds for the best available seats in the stalls were spent for this first London review, the play having done a week in Brighton already. Ben Butley is an academic stuck in an English department in a university at some point in the 1970s and having a frankly horrific first day of term. His wife wants a divorce, he is struggling to write his book on TS Eliot whilst his colleague has got a publishing deal, his students expecting their tutorials are impinging on his time but most significantly of all, his protégé Joseph, with whom he shares his office, his flat and frustratingly vague hints of further intimacy, is seeking his independence both professionally and domestically, about to move in with his lover Reg. In response to this turn of events, he turns up the irascibility and petulance as he flails against a world moving on without him, masking his fear of failure through some thoroughly obnoxious behaviour and a scathing line in rapier-sharp wit. West is a delightful actor and there are moments of cracking entertainment here as he toys with everyone around him, displaying a great physical playfulness as well as an amusing gift for accents and his constant picking at the scab of his bleeding shaving cut is a nice physical manifestation of his approach to his relationships. But for Butley as a character, I found little to engage me with him and provoke any measure of sympathy in his predicament. He seeks to extend his self-destructive tendencies so far as to irreparably wreck the lives of all those around him too and whatever moral code exists in me protested against this, no amount of witty one-liners could excuse that, particularly as there’s no hint of any move towards self-awareness nor the sense of the man he might have been in the past (even if there was, I probably wouldn’t have liked him either…). And so I just didn’t connect with Butley, the man or the play, care what happened to him or buy the idea of his possible redemption. As his protégé, Martin Hutson is really rather good, neatly suggesting that his loyalties have not shifted completely as he struggles to hide his laughter at Butley’s barbs towards his new man, even though there is little to suggest why his devotion is so strong. And circling around them, there’s excellent support from Penny Downie as his rather daffy colleague and department rival and Paul McGann’s dour northern Reg, his rival in the affections of Joseph, has a wonderfully composed demeanour which Butley can’t help but try to provoke. As his wife though, I can’t help but feel Amanda Drew is too good an actress to be playing cameos such as these: I spent most of the second half waiting for her character to reappear, only to be frustrated when she did not!"
1000,1000,Ought To Be Clowns,02/04/2010,Ian,Beyond the Pale, Southwark Playhouse,"If you want to sit down whilst at the theatre, then you’re probably best keeping away from the theatres just south of the river at the moment: one can trek through the Old Vic tunnels, stand at the Young Vic’s recreation of a submarine space or explore the Southwark Playhouse in full at Beyond the Pale. This is an interactive theatre piece, so the audience is invited to participate in the drama by speaking to the characters at any point. Sometimes we’re observers in a scene; sometimes we’re active participants; either way, there are opportunities to find your own way through the story and influence the events that happen. It is set in a dystopian parallel world where violence in South London has swelled to epic proportions leading the government to build a wall around the borough of South Wark to try and contain the problems. Without proper government, anarchy soon came to reign and all connections were severed. 15 years later, the borders have been tentatively reopened and some charitable workers have made attempts to try and make a difference to these abandoned people. We come into the picture a further 5 years later as part of a new effort to recruit volunteers and to solve the ‘problem’ of South Wark. I can’t say much more as I don’t want to ruin it, and in any case, everyone’s experience ought to be unique as they engage in different ways with the performance. I found it huge amounts of fun. After the disappointment of Your Nation Loves You, this was altogether of a better class. Using the location to its fullest, areas behind the auditorium were utilised as well as the main theatre, and although we were in different groups witnessing different scenes, one could see how the threads were interlinked and connected ensuring that we didn’t feel like we were missing out on anything, which was my abiding feeling upon leaving the Old Vic tunnels. And there was a strong interesting story being told which the format supported, resulting in an entirely satisfying experience. It is well acted throughout, and certainly the actors with whom I engaged directly had a strong grasp of their characters, able to respond convincingly to the random questions I plucked out of the air and carrying their scenes forward with confidence. Special mention has to go to Ciaran McConville with whom I had my first interaction in the bar beforehand and whose whole demeanour completely sold me on the whole shebang before we’d even sat down: he also has a great stage presence as the Rescue Centre Manager. I also enjoyed Richard Atwill’s would-be philanthropist and Simon Nicholas’ manipulative businessman. I highly recommend Beyond the Pale: it has been cleverly conceived, but crucially also excellently executed. Put your reservations aside and plunge in as soon as you get the opportunity, you’ll regret it if you don’t and it’s the way to get the best out of the whole experience. Really? Really?  Might go, although I'd need to take you along to ask the questions I think. I'd be rather tongue tied. Although there is that bar beforehand, as you say… Is that your secret?"

1003,1003,Ought To Be Clowns,13/06/2015,mag9l,The Rehearsal, Minerva,"Chichester Festival Theatre has a long-standing tradition of staging works by the French writer Jean Anouilh, which is continued by this production of his 1950 play The Rehearsal, but it is not terribly difficult to see why he has fallen out of favour with the vast majority of British theatres. Jeremy Sams, directing his own translation here, has pulled together a lusciously talented cast and a sumptuous set and costume design by William Dudley for the Minerva, but it is all sadly just window-dressing, albeit of a very high quality. The play is set in 1950s France, in a chateau inhabited by the fabulously wealthy and the fatuously bored. To pass the time, they’re putting on a show – Marivaux’s The Double Inconstancy to be precise – but art is bleeding into life and vice versa. The feckless Count, the instigator of the whole affair, pressgangs their young governess into joining their company and soon finds his head turned by her fresh charms. This is to the consternation of his wife the Countess, who seeks solace in the arms of her own lover, and also of his official mistress Hortensia who sees her shakier position undermined.  Fortunately, life isn’t just a rehearsal, for a Marivaux play or otherwise – the novelty of these scenes soon wears off – but unfortunately, the direction the play takes is problematically dark, maliciously so, and not even the considerable talents of Edward Bennett can pull off this deviation. He plays Hero, an old friend of Tiger’s who is permanently sozzled and prone to periods of reflection in amongst the desperation and destruction he wreaks, guided to dastardly deeds by the manipulations of others but pulling too far from the world of the first act. "
1004,1004,Ought To Be Clowns,24/06/2012,Ian,Little Women in concert, Playhouse,"Louisa May Alcott’s tale of the lives and loves of four New England sisters may be set during the American Civil War, but there’s a homespun simplicity to their overlapping stories which remain firmly in the personal sphere. Walker’s music has perhaps a more contemporary feel than one might have expected but it attempts to evoke the right spirit across a number of genres. In some cases, he has hit the nail on the head with twinkling gems like First Impressions, Helena Blackman delivering comedy perfectly, and the soaring duet between Sarah Lark and Nikki Davis-Jones, both in gorgeous form. Elsewhere though, other songs felt like they needed to be much more tightly focused, Walker indulging in a few too many purely decorative vocal riffs and frequently allowing songs to drag on a little too long. Overall though, I found Walker’s music rather agreeable and most aptly for a show about sisterhood, he is most adept at writing beautifully for multiple voices. This kind of concert set-up has been used many times before but needs a little careful work to ensure that it is effective. There’s no doubting Mark Shenton’s lasting commitment to new musical theatre but employing him as the narrator-of-sorts wasn’t an entirely successful move, especially contrasted to the vivacity and humour that say, Sandi Toksvig brought to her similar role in Soho Cinders. And the structuring of the show feels a little off in its current state, the first half is considerably too long and any tinkering or cutting will need to take into account the musical balance of the show."
1005,1005,Ought To Be Clowns,21/06/2012,Ian,Utopia, Soho Theatre,"What is Utopia? Defining the hopes and dreams of a perfect world has occupied writers for hundreds of years and in this co-production between Newcastle’s Live Theatre and the Soho Theatre, contemporary writers have also been asked to explore their own takes on the concept, blueprints for future happiness, which have been woven altogether by Steve Marmion and Max Roberts in this ambitious, if unwieldy production. In a strange grey room, six pierrots work their way through the different blueprints, working through the various scenarios to see if any of them actually do lead to the promised land. Some are funny and satirical as in the warlord discovering the power of Facebook or the old-school stand-up whose jokes fall flat in a world of perfect harmony. And some are more serious, as the authors probe the idea of utopian ideals arising out of  less-than-perfect situations, acts of self-sacrifice and tender kindness coming out of the blue. There are twelve blueprints in total all mixed up in here and the combination is not always 100% successful. The first, overlong, half has a shonky, almost vaudevillian feel to it as there’s a little too much focus on the clowning around which threatens to unbalance the whole piece. But after the interval, the fragments of story coalesce in a much more effective fashion, not least in the transgressive power of Tobi Bakare’s rousing speech which leads in an unexpected direction. Perhaps predictably they save the best for last: two pieces intertwined beautifully as Michael Chaplin’s tale of a quiet, melancholy moment of connection between an elderly MP and her gauche young carer, Pamela Miles and Laura Elphinstone both excellent here, is contrasted with the gradual, thoughtful, progress through Simon Stephens’ almost chirpy The Sun Will Come Up. And there’s something movingly apt about the place that the final Utopian act comes from, which almost flies in the face of the impressive roll-call of names and grand ideals."

1007,1007,Ought To Be Clowns,17/11/2012,Ian,Constellations, Duke of York’s,"Due to its often fleeting nature, it is a real luxury to be able to properly revisit a show at the theatre. Not just to return to a play during the same run but to experience the same production anew in a different environment, and for those who were able to see Nick Payne’s sparkling new play Constellations upstairs at the Royal Court earlier this year, that opportunity now presents itself as it takes up residence at the Duke of York’s, with its original stellar cast of Sally Hawkins and Rafe Spall, to complete the Sloane Square venue’s highly successful season of transfers.  On paper, it is an intriguing if a little opaque prospect: Payne’s play takes scientific principles like quantum multiverse theory and uses them to explore the infinite possibilities of one relationship. In reality though, it is a highly moving account of the connection between beekeeper Roland and scientist Marianne, exploring different permutations and possible outcomes of their lives as scenes repeat themselves from different angles, different viewpoints, sending their relationship down a different path each time, even as they seem to be drawn to the same inescapable conclusion. (My original review of the show can be found here and to avoid repeating myself too much and to be a bit different from a regular review, this piece of writing will focus mainly on my experience as someone revisiting the show). Michael Longhurst’s production has been reconfigured for the new space, moving from the intimate in-the-round arrangement to the grander proscenium arch of the Duke of York’s. The helium-filled balloons of Tom Scutt’s design remain in their powerful simplicity but it is highly impressive how both Spall and Hawkins have amplified their performances without losing any of the subtlety. So the experience from row M of the stalls compared really quite well to having the actors mere feet from our faces, different for sure but in a good way and indeed it allows for a more complete worldview of this universe, and then the next, and then the next. It unquestionably remains impeccably acted. Spall’s blokish affability captures a gorgeous sense of modern metropolitan masculinity and Hawkins’ adorably dorky (adorkable?) persona holds the heart ever so tenderly, allowing her to play the more wrenching scenes with a devastating precision. With each synaptic flash of Lee Curran’s lighting, they flick between entire worlds of emotion: so a chance meeting is variously treated with cautious surprise, sexually charged anticipation or arch suspicion; a proposal is delivered with hesitant charm, with nervous energy, with seductive confidence. What struck me most though was how technically accomplished both performances are, in winding through the realm of seemingly endless options. The free-flowing energy that both bring to bear made it feel like they were practically riffing, improvising even when I first saw the show, but it soon became apparent how perfectly calibrated and precise it all is – a thrilling masterclass in intimately epic acting.  And knowing what was coming made it ultimately all the more moving for me on second viewing. I shed a tear or three back in January, but this time round something deeply profound stirred in me and I spent a good 30 minutes not even bothering to stem the tears streaming down my face and I couldn’t even look at my companion at the end for fear of bawling. Oddly enough, one of the few textual changes that I noticed was one of the things that moved me most last time, a stutteringly repeated phrase from Marianne poignantly threaded throughout the play, which Payne appears to have removed and which felt like a genuine shame as it provided a slightly stronger connective strand to hold onto in the labyrinth of shifting possibility.  Exciting, exhilarating, enthralling, engaging. Or stimulating, stirring, searing, spellbinding. Whichever way you look at it, this piece of intricately clever new writing is proof positive that no matter which universe we end up in, it will be a poorer place if theatre like this isn’t an integral part of it. I really can't wait to see this again, especially with the original cast. One of my favourite shows this year, and so much better than Jumpy."
1008,1008,Ought To Be Clowns,07/12/2017,Ian,The Box of Delights, Wilton’s Music Hall,"The nods to the occasional naffness of that design (a car that turns into an aeroplane!) were much appreciated but such is the warmth and wit of the theatrical invention here, that it is hard not to be won over by Piers Torday’s adaptation of John Masefield’s 1935 fantasy novel whether you’re familiar with it or not. And though it flirts with the odd sinister undertone, the abiding feel is one of adventurous derring-do and festive cheer, fit for whatever family you have around you. Set in the depths of Christmas 1938, we’re in the world of plum puddings and hot possets, where schoolboy Kay Harker finds his journey home from boarding school disrupted by falling into the middle of a battle between two mighty magicians. Given the precious Box of Delights by one of them, he’s charged with protecting it – and by extension, the very future of Christmas itself – but little can prepare him for the magical power that is contained within. Alistair Toovey is an engaging, wide-eyed lead as the rather prim Kay and he’s balanced well by Samuel Simmonds’ Peter (“be honest, am I an absolute plank?”) and Safiyya Ingar’s marvellously self-possessd Mariah (“a girl unafraid to wear a fake beard and throw a knife”). And the multi-roling company around them, covering mythological creatures, talking animals, nefarious gangsters and hapless policemen but name but a few of their characters, are well-delineated. Visually, it is often stunning – in the exquisite beauty of how a phoenix is manifested in Samuel Wyer’s puppetry design, or the simple but powerfully effective use of a giant sweep of fabric by designer Tom Piper to evoke a torrent of water and all the danger it poses (Simon Pittman’s movement work coming into its own here). And there’s much use of projections (by Nina Dunn) to portray some of the more fantastical goings-on. Audibert makes great use of music with composer and sound designer Ed Lewis, beautiful arrangements of carols interspersing the action. And when you have as superlative a singer as Josefina Gabrielle in your cast, why wouldn’t you let her fill this most atmospheric of rooms with the gorgeous sound of an unaccompanied ‘In The Bleak Midwinter’. Gabrielle doubles brilliantly as fruity villain Pouncer and somewhat ill-suited guardian Caroline Louisa, a feat matched by Matthew Kelly as the duelling sorcerers. So a suitably festive alternative to your standard pantomime fare, and a great way to get young people into and aware of this most special of venues. It’s also an alleviation to at least some of my childhood nightmares (although there’s still something creepy about the whole shebang – just watch these opening credits – and that’s not even including the talking disembodied head). And make sure you get a programme, it is a little piece of absolute genius."
1009,1009,Ought To Be Clowns,19/06/2017,Ian,Trinity, The Asylum Peckham,"So in their words, Trinity “explores the aesthetics of gender and female iconography in society’s visual culture, from pagan and religious artefacts to pop culture’s bedroom selfies”. |In mine, it exploits the visual representation of female roles to stunning effect but decreasing returns, as it offers little more that is tangible. Created by Valentina Ceschi, Guoda Jaruseviciute, and Kate Lane, who also perform the piece, it it undoubtedly deeply felt and there are moments of real beauty and emotion. But there’s also bafflement and frustration in there as you try to dig beneath the visual aesthetic to find…well, nothing there that you can take away yourself. Staged in the derelict remains of a gothic chapel in Peckham, the location also adds to this. It is a hugely atmospheric space but one hardly suited to the purpose at hand, the piece often feeling marooned in its fog of dry ice, what specificities there are swallowed up by unforgiving sightlines.  But still, but still, it lingers long in the mind with all its offbeat inventiveness. It is so effectively visual and Demetrio Castellucci’s ritualistic electronic score is haunting indeed – a real curiosity which you should probably make up your own mind about.     ."
1010,1010,Ought To Be Clowns,31/08/2013,Ian,Cabaret, New Wimbledon,"Perhaps with a nod to the fact that it isn’t that long since it was in the West End, the touring production of Kander and Ebb’s Cabaret directed by Rufus Norris is just playing a few days at the New Wimbledon Theatre before touring the country. It was a production that I enjoyed when I saw it back at the Savoy and crucially, it has made the one casting change it needed to really improve. Despite her best efforts, Michelle Ryan never felt really at home as Sally Bowles and the introduction of Siobhan Dillon is a clever one as she embodies the simultaneous fragility and strength of this most iconic of characters. Otherwise, there isn’t too much more to say about it that wasn’t already said in that previous review. Will Young is a genuine revelation as a chilling Emcee, Matt Rawle’s bisexual writer Cliff exudes chemistry all around and the older lovers torn apart by the encroaching regime hits a real chiming note – Lyn Paul taking over from Siân Phillips against Linal Haft. And Valerie Cutko is an inspired casting choice for Fräulein Kost, a character I always end up wanting to see more of."
1011,1011,Ought To Be Clowns,10/01/2003,Ian,Anything Goes, National Theatre,"Stephen Mears’ choreography which is played out on a relatively static set, the multi-level deck of the cruise liner, was probably my favourite element of the night, if pushed, the sheer imagination and skill on display is just breath-taking and magnificent to watch – the excellent tap numbers just make me want to learn to do it properly. But there’s no real weaknesses here and Porter’s music is just so full of classic songs that everything is just so irresistible, it really was one of those evenings where I didn’t stop smiling. John Barrowman – a man who has that kind of matinee idol looks that can only ever be described as handsome – makes a fine Billy, lovable and believable and very fine of voice, his skill at singing Porter’s songs making them feel fresh and new. He had nice chemistry with Mary Stockley’s Hope with whom he shares a number of duets but it is Sally Ann Triplett’s Reno Sweeny who emerges as the star of the night, combining great comedic skills with a belting voice that blows (Gabriel Blows) the show up to heavenly heights."

1013,1013,Ought To Be Clowns,09/03/2010,Ian,Once Upon A Time At The Adelphi, Union Theatre,"Phil Wilmott is clearly a master at directing large casts in tiny spaces and combined with Andrew Wright’s amazingly precise choreography, conjures more energy and life in the intimate space of the Union Theatre on a shoestring here with Once Upon A Time at the Adelphi than I saw at any point during that other show that I saw at another Adelphi recently. A Christmas Carol also by Wilmott and also produced by MokitaGrit, filled me with a whole Santa’s sackful of festive cheer and they are obviously doing something right as this show filled me with the joys of spring, even on this bitterly cold March evening. A huge success with its run in Liverpool, picking up some big awards along the way, this is the London premiere although the programme talks ominously of this being the final chance to see the show. It’s an old-fashioned love story, albeit one set in two different timezones, set against the backdrop of the Adelphi hotel in Liverpool, a venue that capitalised on its location as a major transatlantic port in providing an ideal stopping point for Hollywood stars en route to more glamorous locations. We follow Jo and Neil in the present day as he tries to tempt her into backpacking round Japan with him and Alice and Thompson in the 1920s and 30s with their on-off romance being constantly challenged by events and circumstances seemingly out of their control. And it tells this story so very, very well: simple but effective, moving yet never mawkish and ultimately entirely captivating. Mixing the time periods allows for a wide range of contemporary and classic musical styles to be utilised, but they fit seamlessly together as a pleasingly consistent whole: the highlights are undoubtedly the stunning group numbers, the choreography alone is superb but when one considers the limitations of the space, what is achieved is nothing short of magical. Of the leads, Jon-Paul Hevey will be a shoo-in for Mr Big if they ever create a musical version of Sex And The City: The Early Years, capturing the suave chancer that is Thompson but also giving him a believable softer side too and as the older and younger Alices respectively, Ally Holmes and Rebecca Hutchinson both breathed a nice vitality into our heroine, a woman simultaneously ahead of her time and as a big an old-fashioned romantic dreamer as you’ll ever meet. It has a real sense of warm affection for its location, a love song to Liverpool if you will, and being a child of the North West of England, there’s a smattering of references to places that brought a wry smile to my face: Sefton Park, Widnes, indeed I would wager I was the only person in the audience who could reply in the affirmative when one character asked “have you ever been to Crosby?”! But much like Edinburgh in Midsummer (A Play with Songs), knowledge of the place merely enhances the experience, it is by no means a prerequisite. In vain search of a criticism, there’s perhaps a little too much repetition of the main tune, but then it is a good one with a strong melody and I can still hum it today, which is more than can be said for any of the Love Never Dies songs, even the one I really liked. And given the strength of the earlier choreography, the slow-mo Blitz attack looked a bit clunky, but these are minor minor quibbles. Damn. Yet ANOTHER show to see. I would totally recommend it. But only if you can come up with some witty title and then create a media storm around it!"
1014,1014,Ought To Be Clowns,17/07/2016,mag9l,Beetles From The West, Hope,"Trapped inside a hospital waiting room that doesn’t even have a television in it – only a pile of battered games like Uno and Monopoly – Boyd and Jenny anxiously wait for news of his father. A veteran of Afghanistan, his son angrily tells us he’s a Crystal Palace man, the kind of man who never gets ill, but a severe seizure doesn’t lie and as Henry, his doctor, arrives to take a medical history, it becomes clear that this is a household where the health of both the body and the mind has been neglected. For it emerges that Boyd’s dad has prostate cancer and so James Hartnell’s Beetles From The West deals with the shattering news that a diagnosis can have on those around the patient. And at its elegiac best, the play delves into the memories of all three characters and dredges up their own experiences with their fathers, reflecting on how that has shaped who they are today. Ed Locke’s striking lighting design pulls us out of Kitty Hinchcliffe’s institutional design with poetic power for these sequences and they’re very well done. The play also ambitiously reaches for a world of other reference points – the overstretched nature of today’s NHS, the scandal of the junior doctors’ contract struggles, depression in young men, the progression of cancer itself – and here it is slightly less sure-footed. With a running time of just over an hour, there just isn’t the room to explore them all in the depth they deserve. And the initial writing of Boyd and Jenny as obnoxious types who won’t let the doctor finish a sentence and trust googled diagnoses over his own requires time for them to travel a redemptive arc.  And it is ultimately redemptive. Falling Pennies’ production reminds us that there’s no right way to respond to such news, no one way to deal with cancer. And Hartnell’s writing backs this up with the kind of hyper-real detail that is instantly recognisable – the numbing shock upon receiving bad news that sends the randomest of memories to the fore, the ease with which we slip into describing the “battle” against cancer to disguise its massive complexities, even the way in which the essential truth of your human nature is revealed through how you play board games. "
1015,1015,Ought To Be Clowns,12/01/2011,Ian,Wicked, Apollo Victoria,"As with last year, which saw my first ever trip to Wicked, the first thing that I booked from the Get Into London Theatre website when it launched was a return trip to the Apollo Victoria. As Mr Boycotting Trends had never seen it before and was so desirous, I booked and managed to get rather good stalls seats for £35. Ironically, lastminute currently have a similar promotion on which is something of a rarity for this show but it is a great opportunity to get good seats for a not-quite-as-eyewatering price. So I returned to Oz (although not as in Return To Oz, the film that was responsible for several recurring nightmares I had as a child but seriously, someone should make a show of that) to see the story of Elphaba and Glinda, 2 girls whose destinies to be the witches of Oz are not quite as clear-cut as one might think as an unlikely but deep bond develops between them. Knowing the story this time round meant that the surprise element of the way the show fits into The Wizard of Oz’s mythology was lost but it just meant that I appreciated the main thrust of the story more and admired both the message of tolerance for those who are ‘different’ that it preaches and the frankness with which the messiness and complexity of friendship is portrayed here. And I think this last point is key to its enduring success, there’s something so recognisable in the frustrations both women have with the other that is borne out of true friendship. I have to admit to being disappointed when we found out that Louise Dearman was off as Glinda and that we were getting the understudy, Lucy Newton, but Newton was extremely good with a very confident performance. Her acting was strong throughout, with the comedy bits not being too over-pronounced (despite a passing resemblance to Amy Poehler) and her singing, which started well, grew in confidence to really deliver the goods in the final scenes. I should also probably admit to having a bit of a dislike for Rachel Tucker, based purely on the way she came across on the BBC’s I’d Do Anything. To me, she is so much of a powerhouse that there’s no room for subtlety in her singing or performance, not that Elphaba is a particularly subtle role, but in a rare quiet song like ‘I’m Not That Girl’, I just didn’t get any real emotion from her, I find her occasionally soulless. But it does have to be said that she has a mighty voice and can belt impressively with the best of them and her chemistry with Lee Mead’s Fiyero was strong with a superb rendition of ‘As Long As You’re Mine’. Mead was good in what really is quite a small role, but rightly so as the love story is only a sub-plot in the grand narrative. He danced and sang well, his hair is a thing of wonder and the shallow part of me thought he looked really rather good in his riding boots. Clive Carter as The Wizard and Aileen Donohoe, filling in for Julie LeGrand as Madame Morrible were both solid and whilst I really liked Cassandra Compton’s Nessarose, it feels like too small a part for her immense talent which doesn’t really get to shine through sufficiently here. But as with Tucker, I bring my preconceptions here. So something of a guilty pleasure and I’m not sure that I will revisit the show that often to be honest (in the way Avenue Q and Les Mis have featured and will continue to feature in my life), but Wicked really is a spectacular experience that continues to pack its cast with talent to ensure its never-ending massive crowds and über-fans are not disappointed.   ridiculous programme prices… I wasn't as impressed with Wicked as I thought I'd be… see my review here: http://thoroughlymodernmilly5.blogspot.com/2010/10/wicked-musical.html"
1016,1016,Ought To Be Clowns,27/12/2018,Ian,The Tragedy of King Richard the Second, Almeida,"It’s tempting to think of this production of Shakespeare’s Richard II as specifically designed to rile up Billington and sure enough, he fell into the trap and reviewed the show he wanted to see rather than what was presented to him. He sees what Shakespeare should be; here, Joe Hill-Gibbins shows us what Shakespeare can be.  The Tragedy of King Richard the Second is undoubtedly a consequential adaptation. Compressed to 100 minutes without interval, spoken at speed and set entirely within a grey-walled cell, it is disarming and disruptive. But it also works beautifully once you’re attuned to its rhythms as it makes the blind pursuit of power its central thesis, underscored by the desperation of the elite to cling onto their political influence. What sticks most in my mind is the melding of all the supporting characters into an anonymised ensemble of six who often move as one amorphous huddle, tracking the way they see the political winds blowing. Deviating from the norm often comes at a cost but even their assumed unity can’t stop from pointless infighting breaking out. John Mackay, Saskia Reeves and Martins Imhangbe particularly stand out here.  But Simon Russell Beale and Leo Bill tussle magnificently as Richard and Bolingbroke, both exploring something of the humanity of their positions – the impossibility of being a divine ruler, the challenge of being the one to bring them down – especially in the shifting grounds of supporters on whom they can never truly rely. The contemporary parallels suggested are a delight to muse over, particularly as they’re never hammered home."
1017,1017,Ought To Be Clowns,05/12/2012,Ian,Hello, Dolly! Curve,"Dee’s Dolly Levi is a marvellous confection, making this professional matchmaker less of an overtly comic whirlwind than one might expect. Her performance is full of subtlety: a deep sincerity in her beliefs, a minor note of melancholy that creeps in every time she mentions her late lamented Ephraim, but also a wonderful wit which makes the glint in her eye all the more playful whether she’s teasing audience members or pulling the strings of her clients. And though not necessarily the strongest singer, the arrangements have been cleverly reworked to suit her rich contralto and there’s something touching in having these songs delivered with a modicum of vulnerability rather than being belted out in the manner one assumes Caroline O’Connor would have done, her being originally cast in the title role but later withdrawing. Laura Pitt-Pulford continues to prove that it won’t be long before it is her turn to start headlining shows such as these with a gorgeously warm performance as hat-shop owner Irene Molloy who delights in being swept up into the eager arms of Cornelius Hackl, and quite frankly who wouldn’t when he is played with such charisma as by Michael Xavier, adorably daffy and yet infinitely moving in his declaration that this is his happiest day, minute, second, moment. Ngo Ngofa and Jason Denton have great chemistry too as the similarly lovestruck Minnie and Barnaby and as the curmudgeonly Horace Vandergelder, Dale Rapley weathers the onslaught of Dolly’s attentions with wearied wit and appeal. There’s something really nice too about the way in which Kerryson appreciates the talents of his dancers and showcases them through David Needham’s choreography – the waiter number is a well-established tour-de-force for the male dancers and does not disappoint at all, but the extended dance break in Dancing is neatly choreographed in a number of small groups, keeping the stage uncluttered and really allowing the individual skills of the performers to shine. Likewise, I liked that Ben Atkinson’s 8-strong band are in full sight on the stage and there’s a lovely touch of a local brass band, to the obvious delight of several audience members, participating in the joyous parade that closes Act 1, it all feels so apt to the convivial, entirely cynic-free atmosphere that is curated inside the Curve. There will be other, more objective reviews that come once the show has opened and I can see that it won’t necessarily be to everyone tastes. But this is a big warm-hearted production of a big Broadway show and I just really enjoyed myself. The show was like a warm blanket of loveliness to snuggle against from the cold outside and my own ailing health and sometimes, that is more than enough. Running time: 2 hours 10 minutes (with interval)
Programme cost: £3.50
Booking until 12th January"
1018,1018,Ought To Be Clowns,12/05/2011,Ian,Shrek The Musical, Theatre Royal Drury Lane,"I hadn’t originally intended to go to Shrek The Musical, certainly not this early in the run, never having seen the films and having a somewhat mixed reaction to the lead casting. The Nigels, Lindsay and Harman, intrigued me but Amanda Holden (I’ve never seen Britain’s Got Talent either) and Richard Blackwood did not appeal. But when an offer appeared on the show’s Facebook page, for £40 tickets at the front of the Upper Circle at a ridiculously cheap price of £15, I snapped up a pair as a birthday treat. A big-budget production of the show had a relatively short run of just over a year on Broadway but a much-revised version went out on tour across North America last year and it is a copy of this scaled-down production that is now previewing in the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, directed by Rob Ashford and Jason Moore. It has a book and lyrics by David Lindsay-Abaire (also writer of the harrowing Rabbit Hole – talk about diversity!) and music by Jeanine Tesori, and according to my lovely companion for the evening, it cleaves very closely indeed to the first film in the franchise, right down to the same jokes being repeated. This is a review of an early preview, indeed there’s about a month of preview performances, so do bear that in mind as I have.  Following the grumpy ogre Shrek whose peaceful, isolated swamp is invaded by a large group of fairytale creatures who, as it turns out, have been banished from the Kingdom of Duloc by the dastardly Lord Farquaad. Shrek then journeys to the palace to reclaim his swamp but ends up being commandeered into a quest to rescue the Princess Fiona from a tower guarded by a dragon, accompanied by a talking donkey called, well, Donkey. As ever on quests, our protagonists find there’s more to each other than meets the eye which leads them in directions they do not anticipate. It’s a pleasingly direct story, and the audience around me were loving the many moments of recognition as scenes from the film are faithfully replicated. But the show is also full of multi-layered humour that means it will and does appeal to adults and children alike. Best for me were the countless cheeky digs and affectionate call-outs to other musicals: The Lion King, Les Mis, West Side Story and Wicked were my personal favourites, see how many you can spot! I still maintain that Nigel Lindsay is too good an actor to be covered so in prosthetics and make-up but even with these encumbrances, he made for a great leading man. Yes, there are better singers out there but very few of them would be able to capture the lumbering affability that grows into real charm as his quest draws out unexpected feelings, balancing the broad humour with genuine emotion. As Princess Fiona, Amanda Holden got to show off acting, dancing and singing skills which were all pleasantly surprisingly good, the song with her younger selves ‘I Know It’s Today’ was just lovely and I thought she made a great sparring partner for Lindsay in the second half as they discover they’ve more in common than at first sight. But it is Nigel Harman as the diminutive Lord Farquaad who is the show-stealer, performing entirely on his knees. He’s a great singer (probably the best of the leads) with excellent comic timing here, but also blessed the more energetic songs complete with hilarious choreography and sight gags that make his scenes an absolute pleasure. It does also mean that he is missed when not onstage. The ensemble is also exceptionally good though, full of recognisable faces from several much-loved shows (if ever there was a sign I see too much theatre it is here in how many of these people I was excited to see!) and they provide a great energy throughout the show, whether vocally in a number of songs or working through Josh Prince’s neat choreography. The dancing rats were fun, the guards accompanying Farquaad are excellent, but they are probably best when playing the other fairytale characters who force Shrek on his odyssey: Jonathan Stewart’s Pinocchio and Alice Fearn’s Gingy deserving special mention here, as does Landi Oshinowo’s powerful vocals behind the dragon. There’s only a couple of elements that could do with tidying up, like Lord Farquaad’s cape needs to hang closer to his legs when he is side on to the audience, especially when walking as it doesn’t look good, but otherwise the show looked in excellent shape, especially considering how early it is. The only issue I had was with Richard Blackwood as Donkey. Part of it was due to the structure of the show, the character of Donkey actually has little to do of genuine interest: Shrek and Donkey’s road trip action is rather dull, epitomised by a nice piece of stagecraft with an impressive rickety bridge emerging only to be barely used in a rather short scene; and once Fiona joins them, he is a constant third wheel in their burgeoning relationship, often to be found just lurking in the background. But he doesn’t help himself with a performance that could only be described as lacklustre at best: acting-wise, he was very flat, even something as simple as walking off the stage was poorly done – Lindsay broke hearts with his trudging off after harsh words with Fiona but when Donkey subsequently leaves after bitter words with the upset ogre, Blackwood brought no emotion and just walked off. He has a way to go to get up to the quality of his stage companions before opening night. All in all though, I had a good time at Shrek. There’s an infectious enthusiasm about the piece that was just hard to resist and there were countless moments of raucous laughter, most coming from Harman’s portrayal of Farquaad which will surely be a safe bet for nomination in the next award season. The set looks fine without being particularly elaborate or in tune with the available space at the Lane but there’s some great moments involving the dragon which the kids (both big and small) will love. As with most new musicals, it was hard to remember any of the songs the moment we’d left the theatre and I think the show could benefit from one or two stand-out hits, solid-gold musical numbers that linger in the mind long after the curtain has gone down. But I suspect this will weather whatever critical responses come its way, it is pure popcorn entertainment after all, and settle down into a strong family show. This musical is one of my Guilty Pleasures – I saw it on Broadway and although not perfect I really enjoyed it – agree it has a way of capturing the young in the audience…having not seen the UK version yet, I can't really compare but from what I have seen the Dragon is much improved (my big let down of Broadway)but I am sad to see Donkey Pot Pie as a song go. In regards to the music it is a real grower have a listen on spotify, It regularly keeps me entertained on a long journey!!!"
1019,1019,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,The Noble Nine, VAULT Festival,"Any play that starts with a face-off to ‘Mmmbop’ has to be worth your attention right? And Matt Parvin’s The Noble Nine proves to be pretty much just that with its frantic, scrappy charm filling the echoing chamber of the Cavern at the VAULT Festival. Matt Parvin’s offbeat comedy is a grown-up spoof of Enid Blyton’s tales of team-based, derring-do and even has its own catchphrase “leave it to the Nine!” (which does also feel like an incomplete Brooklyn 99 tagline…).  This Noble Nine are the grandchildren (plus a furry friend) of author Estelle West who took inspiration from their childhood games to pen a series of best-selling novels. Now they’ve grown-up and grown apart – “when was the last time that we were together” – but the news that Granny is on her deathbed and the promise of their inheritance brings them reluctantly back together. And what seemed like fun games to play take on a more sinister tone as some unchildlike truths begin to rear their head – what a caper indeed."
1020,1020,Ought To Be Clowns,09/10/2014,Ian,Henry IV, Donmar Warehouse,"Every time Harriet Walter speaks as the eponymous character, she utterly justifies (not that it needs any justification, mind) the all-female casting of the Donmar Warehouse’s Henry IV, such is the achingly rich poetry that she brings to the verse. Coming in second in what is being loosely termed a ‘prison trilogy’ after a cracking take on Julius Caesar back in 2012, the production reunites director Phyllida Lloyd with Walter and some others from that company to impose their institutional stamp on another of Shakespeare’s works (and yes, it does mean those chairs are back in the stalls!). Here, the scope of Henry IV Part I and II has been telescoped down to just two hours and in reality, could well be called Henry IV Part I+ as it focuses mainly on a raucously rendered take on that play and throws in excerpts from Act IV Scene V and Act V Scene V from its sequel to round off the stories of Henry IV, Prince Hal and the bounteous Falstaff. It’s an audacious approach but one that really pays off, suggesting that maybe Shakespeare could have done with an editor after all – others may disagree but there’s little that’s really lost in jettisoning a whole heap of supporting characters and their scenes in this instance. Rather, we get an intense rendering of the relationship between an ageing monarch and their upstart offspring as Walter’s magisterial King Henry IV looks on balefully as Clare Dunne’s wonderfully self-possessed Hal concentrates on carefree carousing rather than the duties of a good prince. Ashley McGuire’s Falstaff makes for a highly understandable distraction though, huge amounts of fun as she works in what must be the first Shakespearean reference to Pulp’s ‘Common People’, and as Hal’s nemesis Hotspur, Jade Anouka is a genuinely thrilling presence. Setting the show as a performance by women prisoners, as with Julius Caesar, again has its strengths and weaknesses. It allows for cleverness – Hal and Hotspur’s climactic struggle takes place in the boxing ring, the hints of tribalism in the ethnic groupings – but also has a restrictive sense about it too. The breaking of the fourth wall is deployed once again to little substantive effect and in these post-Orange is the New Black times, the bar has been raised in terms of telling nuanced stories about convicts and given this is the second time we’ve seen (some of) this group, I find myself wanting to know something, anything, about the women themselves – what crime has Walter’s perp committed?"
1021,1021,Ought To Be Clowns,07/07/2013,Ian,Masterpieces, Royal Court Surprise Theatre via YouTube,"Alongside the Weekly Rep season, another of the major innovations at the Royal Court as part of their Open Court summer is the notion of Surprise Theatre. Here, the upstairs space has been taken over on Mondays and Tuesdays and tickets sold without any information being given about what is to be performed. An ambitious move to be sure but one which clearly paid off as the run soon sold out – but even with the assurance of a quality programme, I have to admit to not being willing to take the risk. I like to be able to have the choice of how I spend my money and my time. Perhaps with an eye on this, or just acknowledging the limited number of tickets for the smaller theatre there, many of the pieces of theatre have been made available on their YouTube channel – the performances themselves filmed from a standing camera, and allowing many more people to experience the surprise. A good thing, one may think, but having watched one of them – the performance of Sarah Daniels’ 1983 polemic against pornography Masterpieces – I’m not 100% sure it is the most successful of enterprises. Not unreasonably, it takes the form of a semi-staged reading – I imagine Tim Hoare’s production was pulled together in extraordinarily quick time – and with actors of this calibre, it works. Stella Gonet, Lauren O’Neil and Laura Rogers, Harry Hadden-Paton, Geoffrey Streatfeild and Nick Fletcher, this is an incredible list of names to get involved in a one night only thing and demonstrates the pull that the Royal Court has, and looks likely to continue with, in the theatre landscape in London. But the necessarily ramshackle nature of the set-up, especially with the filming being done from a static camera placed near the back, lends a blurry home video feel to the whole affair. I’d go so far as to say that you’re better off treating it as a radio production and just listening to it as very little is really effectively portrayed visually on this recording. It does  make for a satisfying aural experience though – Gonet and Hadden-Paton have particularly sonorous voices, and Rogers and Streatfeild also fare well with their forceful characters. I suppose the other issue for me was with the play itself. Masterpieces is a powerfully uncompromising play on the ills of pornography, detailing its corrosive nature on the very fabric of society itself by exploring different scenarios in which a relationship with pornographic material has brought about some kind of wrong. It’s a bold argument but one which allows for little nuance in the debate and so its impact feels kind of muted, it rants rather than challenges. Maybe that is just how loud the playwright had to shout to be heard back in the early 80s and we’ve moved on a bit now, maybe its because I’m a man, maybe its just my own attitudes towards porn. But in making so much of Masterpieces so extreme, it feels that the importance of its message is lessened somehow and one could be tempted to take it less seriously which is terrible I know, but I’m just being honest."
1022,1022,Ought To Be Clowns,13/04/2014,mag9l,The Big Meal, HighTide,"The major stresses and ongoing strife of family life in all its messiness is at the heart of Dan LeFranc’s The Big Meal, the sole US input into the main HighTide programme, which has already played a short run at Bath’s Ustinov theatre. Taking the idea that much of importance happens around the dinner table, LeFranc explores 80 years of a couple’s life through five generations of a family in an ambitiously sprawling framework which sees time following an anything-but-linear path, swathes of dialogue overlapping noisily with each other and a ton of food. And through the cacophony, it does manage to become something rather exhilarating. It’s a dizzying experience though, and Michael Boyd’s direction manages to somehow embrace the audience into this strange world but keep us discombobulated within it. Sam and Nicole are the couple whose initial meeting in a diner is swiftly followed by the ‘ding’ that indicates passage of time and we see that they’re married with kids and so on and so forth, each ‘ding’ changing something which further complicates the ever-growing family and their troubled dynamic, which essentially boils down to life’s a bitch and then you die, during a silent Last Supper montage. Oh and yes, you will end up like your mother. "
1023,1023,Ought To Be Clowns,14/12/2016,mag9l,Dreamgirls, Savoy,"Part of the reason Dreamgirls can get away with it is that it has had a 35 year build-up. With book and lyrics by Tom Eyen and music by Henry Krieger, the original Broadway production premiered in 1981 and was a big success and though it may not have crossed the ocean, much of its music has, including cabaret staples ‘And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going’ and ‘One Night Only’. So it is hardly the risk of a new musical, though that it how is will be categorised, and thus it has been priced accordingly. Fortunately, the Savoy is not so big a theatre that the Grand Circle ain’t a perfectly decent to watch the show from. The show tells a rather thin tale of three singers, absolutely not based on the Supremes in the way that Gregg Wallace is an essential part of presenting Masterchef: the Professionals, who journey from gauche beginnings in Chicago to the heights of superstardom, experiencing all the cut-throat nature of show business along the way. Parallel to their story is the narrative of American music history and the rise of ‘black’ music (qv Memphis, Motown) and it is here that the show finds its real power, tracing the struggle of The Dreams and their management to battle the racial politics of the music industry, before finding that the industry has its own internal politics that they need to fit too. Here, the changing hues and sparkliness of Gregg Barnes’ costumes come into their own, as much part of the storytelling as Tim Hatley’s set, and Amber Riley’s Effie, Ibinabo Jack’s Lorrell, and Liisi LaFontaine’s Deena are a striking trio. Once the first big heartbreak moment comes, Riley comes into her own though with an astonishing ‘And I Am Telling You…’ that really lives up to the hype (I can’t quite bring myself to say ‘is worth the entrance price alone’).Post-interval gets a little plot-heavy as a whole lot of just desserts have to be set up and then served but ‘One Night Only’ offers another great set-piece in Casey Nicholaw’s production."
1024,1024,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Bat Out of Hell, Dominion,"I jest of course – there ain’t nothing subtle about Bat Out of Hell, apart from the slight price rises on the merchandise stall. Newly installed at the Dominion Theatre, after runs in Manchester, Toronto and at the Coliseum last year, it has lost little of the bizarre, baffling energy that saw it find a very devoted audience. And they’ll be pleased that leads Andrew Polec and Christina Bennington return, the new cast members slot in effortlessly, and the inimitable vocal prowess of all is still ear-splittingly breathtaking, under Michael Reed’s musical supervision. Rob Fowler and Sharon Sexton remain the show’s secret weapon, stealing the thunder like a punked-up Jack and Karen.  But issues remain, and some are exacerbated here. The thinness of the story means that despite the stage being filled with bodies, so few supporting characters actually stand out as they deliver the kind of choreography that Bonnie Tyler would have rejected for being too 80s. And director Jay Scheib seems to have opted to broaden the comic schtick to an overly knowing degree."
1025,1025,Ought To Be Clowns,11/12/2014,Ian,Pomona, Orange Tree Theatre,"Paul Miller’s reign at the Orange Tree looked to be an interesting one from the moment he announced his debut season as Artistic Director, mixing the classic revivals for which the Richmond venue has long been known with a more cutting edge approach to its new writing policy, inviting new directors too to open up the theatre to new eyes. But not even he can have anticipated the veritable Twitterstorm of good publicity that flew up among online reviewers when Alistair McDowell’s Pomona opened last month.  The various stories of people-trafficking, missing twins, RPG playing, criminal misdoings and much more besides are scattered throughout a fractured timeline which only slowly coalesces with a sinking sense of horror. Georgia Lowe’s pitch-perfect design turns the in-the-round stage into a sunken pit which acts as a springboard (or sewer) for the dark swirlings of the drama and there’s fiercely committed performances from the cast – Sam Swann, Sean Rigby and Nadia Clifford in particular – even if the whole thing isn’t quite the second coming promised by some."
1026,1026,Ought To Be Clowns,20/11/2017,Ian,Tiger Bay, Wales Millennium Centre,"So there’s coal men fighting to improve working conditions, African immigrant labour complicating the picture by undercutting them, racism emerging as an ugly thorn, child labour being abused, suffragettes agitating for the vote, and the richest man in the world (the Third Marquess of Bute) who has turned to crystal balls to try and find his missing son. What emerges is a prototype vision for a multicultural society in all its myriad complexities and inequalities, connected in an all-too-human way by circumstance and some stonking great choruses. Aiming for the epic, Tiger Bay certainly succeeds in terms of its scale. Director Melly Still fills her stage with a cast of nearly 40 and Anna Fleischle’s looming industrial design, whilst a 15-piece orchestra led by David Mahoney fleshes out Daf James’ bold score. Musically, it wears its influences proudly as well it might – original musicals have their work cut out for them well before they approach the levels of musical innovation of, say, London Road, and there’s something about the familiarity here that works on an innately comforting level, as earworms drill into the brain. Surprises are sprinkled through though, offering texture and contrast – the female harmonies of the shopgirls, the African and Arabic influences that occasionally break free of the melting pot (aided here by Melody Squire’s choreography). Dom Hartley-Harris’ South African widower Themba is a triumphant leading man and his duet with Vikki Bebb’s kindly Rowena, ‘Taste of Home’, is a real highlight as a relationship starts to grow between them. Naturally she’s engaged to someone else, Noel Sullivan’s villainous O’Rourke, who is in turn still taken by Busisiwe Ngejane’s lady of the night Klondike. The power in Sullivan’s voice is best served in the numerous polyphonic numbers, when the full company unites to great effect and Ngejane stands out pretty much every time she sings, such is the character in her tone. Ruby Llewellyn’s young whippersnapper Ianto is a gift of a part for such a talented youngster, Suzanne Packer delivers wonderfully as the comic relief and making a return to his native South Wales, John Owen-Jones is a striking, if slightly under-used, presence as the Marquess, his expansive tenor always thrilling to listen to. As it comes precariously close to reaching a third hour, there’s no doubting that Tiger Bay needs a keen edit though. At over 30 musical numbers, the score is a tad over-stuffed but narratively too, there’s work that could usefully be done. To tighten up the storytelling but also to completely excise some of the less involving subplots to allow more room for emotional engagement with the key characters and let the more of the plot breathe (I’m still not entirely clear how the labourers’ issues got sorted out). That said, chatting to audience members around me at the interval and at the end, I really got a sense of how much they appreciated the ‘localness’ of the show, pointing out some of the references I hadn’t got, filling in the gaps in my knowledge about Bute and his father – it is things like that that make me appreciate seeing shows with proper audiences rather than the artificiality of a press night crowd. It also got me to thinking how James and Williams have been rather canny with the writing of Tiger Bay, balancing local colour and just enough detail with a larger universality that will serve it well (after some editing), should the show to gain further life outwith this relatively short run.    "
1027,1027,Ought To Be Clowns,28/02/2015,mag9l,Yarico, London Theatre Workshop,"When a show openly acknowledges that it is a work-in-progress, you could be forgiven a certain degree of scepticism but on entering the London Theatre Workshop – perched above a Fulham pub – and seeing the size of their marimba, there can be no doubting the seriousness of the intent behind Yarico. A musical treatment of the opera Inkle and Yarico, itself based on the historical writings of Richard Ligon in A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados, it’s a fascinating look at an interesting time in a difficult piece of history. For though the slave trade forms the backdrop for the story, the opera came at a time when anti-slavery sentiment was on the rise and this sense of being on the cusp of the abolition era adds an thought-provoking texture to the production. Yarico, a young Amerindian woman with a yen for Shakespeare, has her life turned upside down when English ne’er-do-well Thomas Inkle washes up onshore. The only one able to communicate with him due to her studies, she pleads for his life against her hostile fellow islanders and they soon fall in love – so far so happy. But Inkle’s a gambling addict and when he raises the stakes unforgivably high, it is Yarico who must pay the terrible price. It makes for a compelling tale and one of much potential. Much of that lies in the strength of the casting here in Emily Gray’s production – debutant Liberty Buckland has a gorgeously yearning quality to her voice as Yarico, Alex Spinney handles the tricky twists of Inkle’s character well, and the ensemble is liberally sprinkled with eye-catching cameos – Tori Allen-Martin and Jean-Luke Worrell’s respective friends stand out as does Charlotte Hamblin’s Lady."
1028,1028,Ought To Be Clowns,07/03/2013,Ian,Man 1 Bank 0, Soho Theatre,"The sheer variety of shows available at the Soho Theatre these days means that it is unsurprising that some of them are genre-straddling and thus somewhat hard to define. Patrick Combs’ Man 1, Bank 0 is such a show, somewhere between monologue and stand-up comedy and rather incredibly, entirely based on a true story. With credit card debts mounting up and a dry sense of humour about his bank’s willingness to serve, Combs decided to deposit a random junk mail cheque that came through his letterbox and somehow, the $93,093.35 that it promised was cleared into his account.  What follows is Combs’ account of how both he and the bank dealt with it: his moral wrangling with what to do with the money and trying to find out the legalities of the issue by tracking down retired legal professors; and the bank’s heavy-handed response in trying to strong-arm the return of the money without admitting any culpability. He takes us on the many highs and lows of the journey, encouraging audience interaction where he can as the adventure keeps on rolling and showing that sometimes it is actually possible to stick it to the man. Combs’ ‘I know, me!’ schtick is relentless but there are enough wry touches of humour – the frankness of his family’s pronouncements on his fate, the responses from the general public once the story becomes public, the impressions of the various personnel of the story, the ‘gobsmacking’ anecdote – to pull the show through the occasional moments where it feels it might become self-indulgent. And there’s also enough gravitas to the story to stop it from just being lightweight fun – the bullying nature of corporations, the lack of transparency when it comes to exactly what obligations banks have to their customers, and modern society’s attitude towards money."
1029,1029,Ought To Be Clowns,25/01/2014,Ian,Rapture, Blister,"US writer Gina Gionfriddo’s play Becky Shaw was a bracingly funny hit at the Almeida back in 2011 and her latest hit to land on these shows is Rapture, Blister, Burn encouraging its own new debates about modern feminism at the Hampstead Theatre. Taking an intellectual look at competing feminist theories, the politics of pornography and examining just what we mean when we say “women can have it all”, she has created another intelligent comedy which given the audible reaction of one audience member at a key moment, seems set to provoke opinions here. Catherine is a forthright feminist academic who returns to the small New England college town of her past after her mother suffers a heart attack to teach a summer school. There, she encounters her former room-mate Gwen and they soon set about revisiting old memories. For neither is truly happy – Catherine’s career success has come at the expense of a husband and family, whilst Gwen is dissatisfied with the lack of stimulation that being a wife and mum-of-two has brought, supplanting her own aspirations which are renewed as she attends Catherine’s classes. Matters are further complicated by Gwen’s husband being Catherine’s ex and Don too has suffered his own frustrations after settling for a life of mediocrity, so when the skin-tight trousers and stiletto-wearing blast from the past arrives on the scene, the proposition of swapping their lives around to satisfy everyone’s urges becomes a tangible reality. The setting up of this scenario, and the differing feminist viewpoints they each possess, does become a little wordy but it is well worth it, for the turning of theory into practice is both engaging and illuminating. Returning to the stage after a 10 year absence, Emilia Fox is brilliantly sensuous and sensitive as someone just craving the intimacy of love, and Emma Fielding’s bitter unhappiness as recovering alcoholic and therapy junkie Gwen is vividly portrayed. Peter Dubois’ astute direction ensures that our sympathies never settle for long on one side or the other, reflecting the suppleness of the writing, thoroughly interrogating whether we really want the things we say we do or whether its better just to accept things for what they are. And careful to avoid making even her supporting characters just mouthpieces, Gionfriddo pleasingly makes all the generations conflicted in their words and deeds. So Shannon Tarbet’s frequently scene-stealing Avery, who attends Catherine’s class, abandons her feminist solidarity when she suspects that her relationship might be at risk. And Polly Adams’ patrician Alice, as conservative and conventional as they come, has no hesitation in urging her daughter to go after the married man that has loomed so large in her life, Adam James’ handsome slacker Don."
1030,1030,Ought To Be Clowns,30/06/2011,Ian,Dream Story, Gate Theatre,"Arthur Schnitzler’s Dream Story is perhaps best known as the novella that was filmed by Stanley Kubrick as Eyes Wide Shut and allegedly sounded the death knell for the marriage of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Anna Ledwich has adapted it for the Gate Theatre, also serving as director, turning the story into a “part odyssey, part freak out, part nightmare, part psychological thriller” as we delve deep into the sexual imagination of early 20th century Vienna. Well-to-do doctor Fridolin and his wife Albertine return from a party in high spirits and start to confess fantasies to one another, of imagined affairs with other people. But something is awry, he rejects her sexual advances and as he is summoned to a house call, he enters into a long dark night following his impulses as he is propositioned by patients’ daughters, visits a prostitute, attends a masked orgy, all populated by a set of characters whose faces seem to recur again and again, suggesting that the dividing line between real life and imagination has been significantly blurred. And this is where the production is very strong, mixing fantasy and reality so that everything seems to take place in a dream-world, Adrienne Quartly’s sound design expertly guiding the mood of this increasingly nightmarish scenario. Using a small cast and having them play multiple roles up, whilst a necessity, is very effective: several of the women Fridolin encounters look like his wife, etc. But because the whole piece is played at this same pace, of twisted ponderous surrealism, I found it just too vague and sluggish. One of the main problems was I felt that as the pair at the heart of the play, Luke Neal and Leah Muller were just too young, even bland, to really convince as a jaded couple, Muller in particular not able to give the sense of ‘experience’, rather veering closer to petulance for me. Thus, I didn’t find myself entwined in their dilemmas but rather exasperated with the whole thing. What taxed me the most was the fact that the marital bed was far too small for the towering Neal to have ever fit into with any degree of comfort, and when that is the thing that dominates the mind whilst sitting through a show, then something isn’t right (although whether it is the play or me, I don’t know…) I’ll be very interested to hear what others made of this. It was the pacing that was the biggest problem for me. I actually thought the slow pace worked really well in creating the dream atmosphere for the first 20-30 minutes, but once you start to realise that the entire nearly-two-hours is going to be done like wading through treacle with no variation whatsoever it starts to become incredibly tedious. And I think I was too busy wondering how Luke Neal could fit on the stage without banging his head on the lights, to worry about how he'd fit in the bed… He's a strapping young man to be sure 😉  Was talking to someone else about this at the weekend and the way he talked about the sheer daring of Schitzler's writing at the time makes him an interesting figure (although not necessarily the most entertaining…) "
1031,1031,Ought To Be Clowns,07/04/2019,Ian,Sunday Encounters – Anne Reid interviews Derek Jacobi, Theatre Royal Haymarket,"My first trip to the Theatre Royal Haymarket’s Sunday Encounters programme saw us watching Anne Reid interview Sir Derek Jacobi for a hugely enjoyable couple of hours. Co-stars on Last Tango in Halifax, their affection for each other was palpable from the off and clearly based in a shared wry sense of humour which kept the evening from ever getting too ‘luvvie’. But if anyone has had the kind of career that allows them to take that term and thoroughly own it, it is Jacobi. A stage and screen veteran with over 50 years experience, it’s a constant race to pick up the names he drops in passing when referring to Laurence, Maggie, Peter, Judi, Ian…such is the gobsmacking range of his collaborators from across the highest echelons of British cultural life.In many ways, it felt like a worthy sequel to There’s Nothing Like A Dame. What really strikes you though is just how humble he is. Throughout his questioning from Reid, he constantly referred to the luck that brought him so many of the opportunities that took him from Cambridge to Birmingham Rep to the new National Theatre and thence to stardom, rarely noting his extraordinary talents which got him through each of these stages. With such a varied career, film and TV roles scattered among his many entries into the classical theatre canon, he was full of bon mots, wry observations and deliciously barbed comments on co-stars with botox, fawning table-reads or a problem with the drink (I don’t have a tag for Peter O’Toole…). It was also fascinating to hear him talk about his desire to do some new writing onstage (he turned down The Father) as incredibly he’s only done the one (he reckons he’s done 28 of Shakespeare’s plays though!). "
1032,1032,Ought To Be Clowns,08/11/2017,Ian,Contractions, ND2,"I may not be a Deaf Critic but I am a critic who is partially deaf, a state of affairs positions me rather uniquely when it comes to appreciating Deafinitely Theatre’s latest production – a bilingual version of Mike Bartlett’s 2008 two-hander Contractions. Bilingual as a matter of course, as all of Deafinitely’s productions are in using British Sign Language and English but bilingual too as a provocation, in that director Paula Garfield uses neither language continuously. So as we sit through a series of business meetings between a brutally officious manager (who signs) and corporate wannabe Emma (who both speaks and signs), there’s an ingenious sense of dislocation, of delayed and incomplete comprehension, which is as incisive a theatrical representation of what it is like to be deaf in a hearing world as I could ever imagine. And it is a fascinating way to portray the brutal acuity that typifies much of Bartlett’s small-scale plays and their sharp dialogue. Nearly a decade down the line, Contractions has lost none of its relevance in its indictment of corporate culture, both in how it is exacted upon workforces and also how (some) people subscribe so fully to it, at the expense of anything else in their life. Fifi Garfield’s imperious manager is magnificent as she drips with disdain at having to deal with this underling and clearly relishes the control she is able to exert, taking care to cleverly implicate us all in the expectation of what is ‘reasonable’. And opposite her, Abigail Poulton’s Emma is an intriguing presence. Hauled up under a suspected breach of contract then sinisterly pushed to unimaginable limits, Poulton plays out the conflict of someone who knows the ground is being hollowed out from under her, distancing herself bit by bit even as she’s drinking the Kool-Aid. This comes to brilliant fruition in the final grace note of the production which suggests she might just have learned how to play the game.  Contractions also sees the public debut of ND2, the New Diorama’s new rehearsal room complex centred on the extraordinary space of the Atrium, a former trading floor for JP Morgan and a cannily site-specific location for this play, surrounded as it is by working offices looking down onto us. Paul Burgess’ design naturally works effectively here and Joe Hornsby’s lighting design does extremely well to provide interest in a space bleached out by strip lighting, enhanced by the atmospheric swell of Chris Bartholomew’s compositions."
1033,1033,Ought To Be Clowns,31/05/2015,mag9l,Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens,"Just a quickie for this one-off – a fundraiser for the Make A Difference Trust of this late 1980s song cycle inspired by the AIDS memorial quilt. The original London production of Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens actually transferred to the Criterion – where tonight’s show was – from the King’s Head but it’s a little difficult to see how this production with its nearly 50-strong company could ever have been scaled down to fit into that Islington pub theatre. But given how the show is made up of individual songs and monologues, each inspired by a different panel on the quilt representing the life of someone who has died from HIV/AIDS, its inherent flexibility shows how it can take whatever form is needed. Here, Stephen Whitson’s production takes on a new 21st century version of the book by Bill Russell, the updating of which has mixed results. Contemporary references clang a little awkwardly but there’s more of a problem in that neither the fast-moving world of medical advancements nor the changing nature of the epidemic itself are really reflected – the show is already a period piece in so many ways that it perhaps would be better to leave it that way rather than trying to chase a relevance that would be better served by a completely separate part two. That’s not to deny the enormous power of the writing or the absolute tragedy of the lives lost, which remain very moving, and Dean Austin’s musical direction does well with Janet Hood’s music to trace the highly emotional contours of a journey which must never be forgotten. For me, Madalena Alberto in her slinky red dress, Nick Hendrix in his skimpy orange CKs, Fra Fee’s curly locks and Cassie Compton’s powerful voice stood out but it really was a great piece of collaborative theatre, with so many giving up their time and their precious Sunday nights for a very well-deserving cause.  "
1034,1034,Ought To Be Clowns,23/03/2013,Ian,The Book of Mormon, Prince of Wales,"This is going to be less of a review than a jumbled thought piece coming out from the marketing campaign for The Book of Mormon which has seen unprecedented levels of saturation across London. The publicity for the show started way back, adverts on buses and in tube stations have been appearing for months now but the week leading up to last Thursday’s press night saw an absolute deluge of coverage which meant it was even harder to escape. Lengthy preview features which all but reviewed the show were printed in newspapers; the #LoveMormon twitter campaign went into overdrive, using many of those tweets as quotes in adverts which, following the gala opening night, included an incredible four page ad just featuring tweets from celebrities. One might have imagined such levels of hype would be hard to live up to but by all accounts, it has worked as a press release arrived yesterday trumpeting that The Book of Mormon had broken the record for the biggest single day of sales the previous day, taking in an astonishing £2,107,972 and this from a show which had already pretty much sold out until the summer. Of course, one could point to the ticket prices to explain some of the maths – the majority of the tickets are retailing at £74.50 and £127, £39.50 is as far as the cheap seats go (day lottery aside) – but nonetheless, the achievement shouldn’t be underestimated. But what has been fascinating to watch has been the way in which the mixed (but still largely positive) critical reaction was received. A near-evangelical note crept into the response to any review that wasn’t effusive in its praise, to wit the three star reviews from Billington, Spencer and Purves and their contention that this show might not actually be the second coming. In any case, I reckon Billington is displaying his own brand of subversive humour in rooting out a barely-known 1950s Royal Court play to which to compare its satirical element to unfavourably. But channelling the over-zealousness of such blind support, as this campaign arguably seems to be doing, leaves a funny taste in the mouth and ultimately all seems quite unnecessary. I don’t know how organically or otherwise the support for the show grew when it first started on Broadway but personally, I find such overbearing hype a real turn-off as I want to be able to see things on my own terms, make up my own mind about a show, free from any preconceptions manipulated by its publicity machine. And that’s how I feel about Mormon – sat there on Thursday (as I was graciously allowed to accompany a friend), I felt the heavy weight of expectation rather than excitement of seeing something with fresh eyes. For me, the biggest thrills in theatres come when they are not necessarily being expected, when one is able to find one’s way into falling in love with a show.   It happens in different ways for different shows – Avenue Q was instant, Matilda was more of a slow-burner – but being repeatedly told in advance that what you are about to watch is the best and the funniest and the most amazing and the most loved by celebrities, robs the experience of its spontaneity. And I’d much rather have a friend who knows what I like send me a recommendation to a show rather than a tweet in a newspaper from Kate Winslet (who did love it, I can confirm) or Jimmy Carr (who wasn’t sat anywhere near me). In the end, I suppose it doesn’t matter too much as far as The Book of Mormon is concerned. Its ticket sales, into the medium-term at least, suggest it will stick around for a good while, though it will be interesting to see how it fares long-term as its more adult content would seem to preclude too big a slice of the family market. And though I do want theatre to thrive and connect with as wide an audience as possible –which this show does seem to be doing – and there are clearly lessons here that can be taken on-board by others to incorporate into their own campaign, a big part of me hopes that this type of overhyped, ongoing marketing campaign is the exception rather than the rule – it ought to be the show doing the talking. "
1035,1035,Ought To Be Clowns,18/08/2012,Ian,London Road, National Theatre,"Technically speaking this is a re-re-review of London Road, which has made a belated transfer from the Cottesloe to the considerably larger Olivier at the National Theatre, as it is the third time that I’ve seen it. I saw it when it first opened and was blown away by its inventiveness and genuine originality as a piece of musical theatre, and then made a return trip when the show extended its initial run, a visit which coincided with the summer riots here in the UK last year, a time which magnified one of the key messages of the show, of the importance of community. The decision to remount this award-winning and critically acclaimed show, even after a considerable gap of nearly a year, may have seemed like a no-brainer but for those who were able to catch it in the Cottesloe like me, I suspect there may be a little disappointment as something of the magic has been lost in the move. A strong element to this could well be my own snobbery. As the ticket purchasing was up to someone for once, I ended up in the circle – for the first time in years! – and whilst it wasn’t as bad as I had first feared, the distance does make it a completely different theatrical experience. And ‘experience’ is the right word, for this is such a unique show in its hybrid of verbatim theatre, which replicates the speech patterns and intonations of interviewees, and freestyling atonal music, which forms an additional structure and texture as it layers, repeats and counterpoints the speech into something strangely hypnotic and beautiful. Because the tone of the show is so conversational, it suited the intimacy of the Cottesloe like a glove and the performances maintained a level of restraint that felt completely appropriate. But re-sited onto the Olivier’s vast revolving drum, there’s been a necessary element of scaling up which ends up robbing much of the nuanced subtlety from the show. For me, the production looked a little lost on the stage, the Lyttelton would surely have been a much better fit, and as others have pointed out, the opened-out space removes much of the sense of claustrophobic menace that was so key to building the correct atmosphere. What originally provoked shocked laughter feels too broadly comic here; what felt so powerfully real has become something more theatrical. Maybe it would have been all fine from the stalls, maybe I should have just left it at having seen it twice, who knows. London Road still remains a mightily original piece of theatre that shouldn’t be missed, and performed excellently by a cast – all but two are the originals, Linzi Hateley and James Doherty the newcomers here, both fitting in well – who remain sympathetic to the sensitivities of playing such horrific and recent real-life events. Kate Fleetwood and Nick Holder probably edge the honours, but Clare Burt, Nicola Sloane and Paul Thornley run them close, indeed the whole ensemble do. I’ve talked myself back around to liking it again now. Just book."
1036,1036,Ought To Be Clowns,28/02/2012,Ian,A Song Cycle for Soho, Soho Theatre,"Featuring the vocal talents of Michael Cantwell, James Gillan, Niamh Perry and Claire Moore, and showcasing the work of musical theatre writers both established but primarily up and coming, A Song Cycle for Soho marks yet another feather in the cap for Mercury Musical Development, Simon Greiff and their sterling support for the genre. MMD has long been an invaluable resource for British musical theatre writers and Simon Greiff through SimG Productions has been tireless in his promotion of younger names and so there is something very apt about their collaboration here. A Song Cycle for Soho developed out of Andrew Brinded’s original book which cast a bit of a sideways glance at Soho, an area of central London that is teeming with debauchery,history, character and a whole lot more besides. 16 set of songwriters were then invited to compose works that captured the multitudinous quirkiness of life in Soho and the result is a collection of songs that cover history, both recent and long ago, and the modern day; comedy, quiet tragedy and the whole gamut of crazy emotions inbetween. Though the leaps between songs may ostensibly seem huge, director Greiff along with Sarah Travis’ musical direction from the piano weave subtle connections between them to pull the 70 minutes together into a most satisfying whole, diverse but cohesive. We glide from the dark comedy of Alexander S Bermange’s corpse-wrangling ‘It’s Hard To Be An Artist’ to the lonely waitress of Christopher Hamilton and Susannah Pearse’s plaintive ‘Does Anybody Know My Name?’, from the alternative perspective on the Krays in Christopher Ash and Carl Miller’s highly witty ‘Self Respect’ to the quiet introspection of Dougal Irvine’s ‘The Ballad of the Horsely Brothers’. With such a broad canvas, it really is impressive how so many nuggets of neglected bits of story have been unearthed here to such interesting effect. Making it work too was the strength and flexibility of the ensemble of four. Whether in duet, trio or full quartet, their voices meld together beautifully time and time again, whether in the comic business of the Claire Moore-led cougar drama ‘Mummy Knows Better’ or the cabaret stylings of Pippa Cleary and Jake Brunger’s ‘Hey Beautiful People’, one of the evening’s highlights and not just because of the way in which Grindr was neatly inserted to a rhyming couplet! Claire Moore (soon to reprise London Road at the National) was superb throughout as was Michael Cantwell, evidently relishing the opportunity to stretch his comic muscle. Niamh Perry could have perhaps brought a little more volume to some of her numbers but somehow retaining the fragility that works so well too, and the gorgeously smooth-voiced (I loved his Stiles and Drewe number, I wish I wish) James Gillan sparked with obvious chemistry with everyone, including half the audience."
1037,1037,Ought To Be Clowns,25/05/2011,Ian,The School for Scandal, Barbican,"Commencing before the curtain ‘rises’ with a futuristic-Georgian fashion show, complete with gossiping fashionistas, it is clear from the outset that Deborah Warner’s production of Sheridan’s The School for Scandal is no stately Peter Hall-esque costume piece, but rather something completely different. Employing much of the same visual language employed in her 2009 Mother Courage for the National, the Brechtian feel is very much here in the deconstructed pieces of set lying against walls, stagehands visible onstage and placards announcing the scene changes. At a time of ever-increasing tabloid gossip, injunctions, superinjunctions and Twitter, Warner is clearly keen to draw direct comparisons between Sheridan’s Georgian London society (who presumably twittered rather than tweeted) and the shallower end of our own contemporary society obsessions with celebrity and consumerism. This is done in the most heavy-handed of ways, so the scandalous intrigue and politics that surrounds the plot of romantic entanglements, debated inheritances, saucy liaisons, unhappy marriages is dressed in designer shopping bags, a thumpingly loud soundtrack and all sorts of modernities. But against all of the distractions and frippery around the production, it is actually fairly conservatively played. Alan Howard’s irascible Sir Peter Teazle. Aidan McArdle’s manipulative Joseph, John Shrapnel’s swaggering Sir Oliver, even Katherine Parkinson’s frustrated young wife – though a beautifully heartfelt performance – could all slot into a regular production of this show and indeed as we move through the latter half, something approaching convention does creep in. Only Leo Bill’s booze-sodden but nervily energetic Charles feels like something of a reinvigorated character who actually could fit into the suggested modern context. That said, I loved the gossiping coterie of Matilda Ziegler’s Lady Sneerwell, particularly Harry Melling and Stephen Kennedy making a fine nephew/uncle combination. Ironically enough, looking back I think Warner could have afforded to be even more anarchic in her approach to the material and play up the moral ambiguity of all the characters to reflect the ebb and flow of fashionable society more. I wasn’t too clear on the morality on display here: Lady Teazle seems to get away with being quite hypocritical with her volte-face and Charles’ extreme bad conduct is easily overlooked in the face of his brother’s misdemeanours and I’d be ok with it if everyone were complicit in the acknowledgement of rum goings-on. But there’s a definite air of sanctimony to the older male characters which precludes this and so stretching credulity to the limit."
1038,1038,Ought To Be Clowns,14/04/2010,Ian,Oscar’s World, Above the Stag,"Born in France and brought up on Sartre and Beckett, Alex Fiori’s new play Oscar’s World is an existential treat A married couple and their son spend day after day sat on their deckchairs looking out at the ocean, eating tinned rice pudding and searching in vain for the spirit of adventure that sent them away from civilisation in the hope of something more. They talk of leaving, but never quite get round to it despite Oscar’s dreams of the world beyond the horizon. Carol Robb and Peter Saracen as Rose and Nono are very good as the ill-suited married couple who constantly “find themselves on the wrong side of the pond” and with Steven Serlin as the titular son form the dysfunctional family unit at the centre of the play, their character traits becoming more and more pronounced as the years roll by and eccentricities abound. But it is when Teresa Jennings’ French outsider joins the party that sparks begin to fly and the way in which Jennings plays the slow slide of Ziberline into the regular routine is excellently done, the emotion she brings to the final scene is remarkable. Christopher Mark completes the cast with a nice but tiny role. The sedentary nature of the play means that it is ideally suited for the intimate space Above the Stag. Individual beach huts created from the wreckage of their boat line the back wall and deckchairs lie in a sand-strewn pit from which the characters rarely stray. Realistic sound effects also add to the ambience and persist relentlessly throughout the show, constantly reminding us of the repetitiveness of the lives in front of us. Ben Blaber’s lighting design is effective but really comes into its own in the second half with a couple of neat shifts, culminating into a beautifully atmospheric twilight for the final scene, all the more impressive considering the limitations of the venue. The first half does go on for a little too long, once the banality of the family routine has been established, watching the cast endlessly observe it does drag a little, meaning that the second act plays much quicker and more excitingly. In an otherwise excellently directed (by Tim McArthur) play, I’d be tempted to suggest cutting maybe 20 minutes from the first act and running it straight through with no interval, taking us on the whole journey without break and I rather think it would have a greater impact that way."
1039,1039,Ought To Be Clowns,09/09/2009,Ian,Punk Rock, Lyric Hammersmith,"The company is made up of young people (thankfully there’s no 30 year olds dressing up embarassingly as schoolboys) with a combination of some experienced actors and some debutantes. This definitely adds to the freshness of the production, which is handsomely mounted, the library set looking very convincing. The action opens with new girl Lily meeting the somewhat kooky Will who is keen to impress the newcomer but finds his plans skewered by the arrival of other schoolmates into the library. 
As a wryly observed comedy, the opening few scenes do really well at setting the scene of fractious teenage relations and are well-written, with some genuine laugh out loud moments. Appearing to not take itself too seriously, the almost Dawson’s Creek-like speechifying is amusing, especially since it is mostly delivered to the audience with little interaction from the fellow cast members. But with the shift into drama midway through, the weaknesses of the play are sadly highlighted, as it becomes apparent that it is meant to be a realistic portrayal of teenage angst. One find it very hard to buy the sudden brutality of the villain, especially given the foppishness of his nature earlier on, and the passiveness of the other characters in this key scene was also hard to believe. For me, the main problem was the sheer disparity of the group of characters: without a real device to bring them together (c.f. detention in The Breakfast Club) it somewhat stretched the imagination to have this group meet time and time again, especially given the vileness of much of their behaviour towards each other. And whilst I am a fan of good plays running without intervals, the final coda felt like a very misguided addition, managing to both dissipate all the tension that had been built up in the preceding scene and add precisely nothing to the message of the play. A shame really as finishing 10 minutes earlier could have left a much greater impression. Acting wise, Tom Sturridge impressed as Will, reeling off some incredibly verbose passages with ease and benefitting from the one really well-drawn character in the play. Jessica Raine as the object of his affection Lily started off brightly with a superb performance, but soon finds her character sidelined and somewhat reduced to stereotype which was a shame. The rest of the cast did well, but due to their almost caricature-like statuses, struggled to make any real impact, since we are asked to stretch the imagination too much to really invest in any of them."
1040,1040,Ought To Be Clowns,27/03/2011,Ian,Naked Boys Singing, Charing Cross Theatre,"It’s a musical comedy revue loosely in the style of A Chorus Line, following 7 guys as they audition for and then perform in a show which requires them to be in the nude. Which they do, eventually. But before that, there’s an attempt at trying to add depth to proceedings by filling the back-story of some of the protagonists and philosophising about what it means to really get naked, but given that the height of humour here is men shouting as many different terms for male genitalia as they can, any level of sophistication is pretty much wasted. There’s 16 original songs here, boasting 13 writers and so whilst the attempt to impose a narrative to try and get us to care for some of these boys is a brave one, it is ultimately futile as the vast majority of the writing is so puerile in its humour about sex, masturbation and the endless cock jokes. A couple of the songs managed to rise above it with some witty wordplay especially in the circumcision song, which is delivered to one of the stronger singers here. The ensemble are enthusiastic but given it is a cabaret in all but name, a couple of them are painfully exposed as unable to inject the necessary star quality that might transcend the limitations of the material. Matters were not helped by the rather anaemic sound quality. By the time the big reveal is, well, revealed to the tune of a thumping 90s Eurobeat ditty, my eyes were firmly fixed on the door and whether an early exit was possible. Any pretence at subtlety is lost as admirably athletic dance routines are performed with a disarming frankness but to little effect in the end. In building up the anticipation by only having the nudity arrive in the final quarter of the show and trying to create something deeper with these characters, there’s something sad about how it is all then junked for a 20 minute pay-off. Admittedly the clue to this show’s appeal is in the title and I suspect anything I say here won’t impact on the people who want to go, but it is a shame that the audience is not being treated to anything more than a desperately weak piece of theatre."
1041,1041,Ought To Be Clowns,17/04/2018,Ian,Tina the Musical, Aldwych Theatre,"Mamma Mia has a lot to answer for. The jukebox musical is clearly the legacy project that people are looking to once music stars have retired or disbanded (or not even then, in some cases). But whether they take a fictional route (a la Viva Forever or Son of a Preacher Man) or go bio-musical (a la All Or Nothing), it really isn’t easy to make it work that well.  Newly opened at the Aldwych Theatre, Tina the Musical has the credentials to make you hope it can do just that. Directed by Mamma Mia’s Phyllida Lloyd, written by Olivier winner Katori Hall with Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins, and with the almighty back catalogue of Tina Turner to call on, there’s a thrilling sense of energy here which is perfectly encapsulated in the star-making performance of  a fricking amazing Adrienne Warren.    She’s phenomenal as she traces the development of Tennessee native Anna Mae Bullock into all-out megastar Tina Turner, accompanied by a score that varies from pure performance to contrived narrative (a la The Bodyguard). And it is a mixture that actually works, Ethan Popp’s orchestrations and Nicholas Skilbeck’s musical supervision making these classics sound a treat. The issues that Tina has lie in the darkness and complexity of the lifestory being told. This format doesn’t lend itself well to nuance and so the treatment of the considerable parental and domestic violence sits a little oddly here. From father to husband, Turner put up with a hell of a lot in her life and we’re not offered any insight into why. (One wonders what impact her association with this project had here, and also with some of the unnecessary detailing later on in the plot). Thus it can feel a little hard to enjoy Tina unproblematically, to soak up the joy of Anthony van Laast’s choreography or the revolving set and period-perfect costume designs by Mark Thompson. Kobna Holdbrook-Smith makes a decent fist of deepening our understanding of the violent Ike, and Aisha Jawando and Madeline Appiah do their best with the underwritten parts of Tina’s sister and mother. Simply the best? Not quite, though Adrienne Warren’s performance makes it worth the while.   "
1042,1042,Ought To Be Clowns,20/03/2019,Ian,Queer Trilogy, Drayton Arms,"Recent Mountview grads Jack Donald, Katie Paterson and Alexandra Christle have banded together to mount Queer Trilogy, a triple bill of shows at the Drayton Arms that probes interestingly at queer identities, how they’re shaped and formed by past and present but also complicated by the mere act of being. They’re further challenged by being bound together in this format which doesn’t necessarily suit them so well. For they are three disparate, diverse pieces. Christie’s Crystal Bollix Presents The Bitch Ball is a drag act that delves into the social construct of the word bitch and how its continued cultural significance filters down to the individual. Through the use of lip-syncing and some very game audience participation, Bollix’s personality shines through but the piece doesn’t quite have the emotional resonance to achieve the depths it wants. Paterson’s Minor Disruptions also feels like a work in progress, though one with much potential. Adopting an almost music hall-style persona, a series of sketches guide us through a complex portrait of childhood which, she argues, can be as emotionally challenging a time as any, especially for a queer kid (or a hamster…). Teething problems with the production can be smoothed out but a stronger through-line would also be useful to pull it all together. Those two shows make up a raucous second act, which sits in direct contrast to the poetic languorousness of Donald’s A Sticky Season. Drawing on the histories of queer icons Joe Orton and Gaetan Dugas, it follows a young queer man trying to determine the butterfly effect of their experiences on his own life as he searches for a meaning that isn’t always immediately apparent."

1044,1044,Ought To Be Clowns,29/03/2014,mag9l,Dark Vanilla Jungle, Soho Theatre,"In a shock development, Philip Ridley’s latest work is a conventional rom-com of a show with a happy ending… As if. It doesn’t even seem credible does it and without fail, Philip Ridley’s Dark Vanilla Jungle exists in the dystopian, fractured worldview of Andrea, a young woman whose desire for love, family and a sense of home crashes hard into an unloving society that sees her exploited and abused with tragic results. What is different is that it is Ridley’s first monologue for over 20 years and in Gemma Whelan’s hands, it becomes a hugely exhilarating and exhausting experience even just to watch it. The emotional resources she must have to draw on, alongside the technical demands of an intricate, layered 35 page script, result in a sensational performance that strips things back right to raw emotion and impassioned feeling. Damaged by a disruptive childhood and mercilessly groomed for sex by a gorgeous older man she meets out one night, Andrea’s tale is one of endless mistreatment at the hands of others mostly, but not exclusively, by men. It starts off intense and fierce and desolate but we soon come to see that things are only just beginning to kick off, there’s so much more in this Pandora’s Box of despair that just keeps on spewing forth. Dark Vanilla Jungle is full of Ridley’s customary poetic imagery, diamonds glitter and orchards sway gently in the breeze as pain and horror wreaks its path through Andrea’s life. But it is not without humour too – her take on depictions of the Nativity is singularly unique and wittily observed, and the way Whelan interacts with the audience has (sometimes) a charming touch to it which draws us right in as listeners, to be spat back out again with considerable venom."
1045,1045,Ought To Be Clowns,18/03/2012,Ian,The Laramie Project, De Montfort University at the Curve," Is a homophobic murder more significant than a ‘straight’ one? Whatever the answer, if indeed there is one, the brutal attack and subsequent death of Matthew Shepard in the small Wyoming town of Laramie in 1998 became a hugely significant touchpoint on the issue. The murder and its ensuing aftermath focused attention, both national and international, on the insufficient nature of hate crime legislation – of which there was none in Wyoming – specifically around homophobically motivated attacks and eventually set in motion, changes in US law. To try and make some sense out of the tragedy and to document its impact on the community in which it had happened, Moisés Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project travelled there to conduct a series of interviews with residents affected both directly and indirectly by the events and constructed this piece of verbatim theatre from those conversations – The Laramie Project. The result is a patchwork quilt of emotion and prejudice, of horror and hope, of devastating emotional impact. As sixty characters are represented here by thirteen actors, the focus ends up being the community of Laramie rather than Shepard himself as everyone is given the chance to air their view. The immediate point of comparison for me was with London Road, another verbatim project that similiarly examined a community’s response to a horrific event and didn’t shy away from the variety of responses, not all of them quite as palatable as one would hope for. So alongside the heart-wrenching stories of Shepard’s friends and relatives, we get the vitriolic Fred Phelps; the compassionate clergyman whose world-view is altered is contrasted with ranchhands who don’t much agree with what those gay fellas get up to; and the responses of the theatre-makers themselves are also documented in excerpts from their journals as they process what they are hearing and learning. Upcoming young director Josh Seymour handles the weightiness of the subject with an assured hand which ensures the utmost clarity as the kaleidoscope of responses keeps on changing. Spotlights on chairs are effectively employed to distinguish scenes with just enough hints of costume change to take us through the roll-call, fuzzy clips of radio and television reports take us through transitions and add another layer to the storytelling. And in a cast that has been recruited from all years of the De Montfort University drama programmes, there are performances of piercing integrity, heartfelt honesty and understated precision which captures the different rhythms of such a diverse community. There are no caricatures here, which ratchets up the constricting sorrow at the conviction with which so much prejudice is held, even if it is not overt: the relief of the mother whose daughter hasn’t got AIDS, the parents of the drama student who are ok with him play a murdering Scottish king but not a gay man, the list goes on. (I couldn’t name names here but if we were judging on hair colour, the gingers would win my acting plaudits.) The Laramie Project is undoubtedly a remarkable play and this production of it should certainly be commended for its quiet beauty and resonance. But it is also a play that provokes complex emotional responses, especially now that we’re more than 10 years down the line, that are rather disturbing. There’s a crushing relentlessness to the play which follows the authentic timeline rather than a conventionally neat dramatic arc, so the sense of catharsis that one yearns for never really materialises, even with the convictions of the accused. Rather, the emergent message lies in the hope for the future, in the change that this horrific event will inspire, the equality that will arrive. It is true that some significant progress has been made, the Matthew Shepard Hate Crime Prevention Act was signed into law in 2009 (though my limited understanding of US state vs federal law means I’m not sure if it is actually in place in Wyoming), but in so many depressing ways it feels that little has actually changed."
1046,1046,Ought To Be Clowns,08/10/2020,Ian,The Off Key, White Bear Theatre,"Some relationships just f*ck you up. Such is the one between Sam and Olivia that lies at the heart of new musical The Off Key. Friends on the singer-songwriter gig circuit, he’s long been in love with her but can only tell her (inadvertently) through the medium of song, specifically his newest song ‘I Like You, Break Up with Your Boyfriend for Me’. Thus starts an intense affair that is destined to only ever end one way… Writer and performer Scott Mackie utilises the gig format well to inform his musical, packing worlds of passion and pain not only into the bluntly confessional songs but also into their brief introductions, the gig patter here is some of the most brutally funny I’ve heard in a good while. And as they shag and split, cheat and come back together, the emotional toll of this tumultuous relationship shapes their creative response. Musically, Mackie runs the gamut of the guitar-based singer-songwriter, from plaintive emo through folk inflections to something angrier and rockier. I particularly loved the influence of The Civil Wars on some of the duet numbers, the combination of Mackie’s voice with Molly Glynn-Whitehead’s sparkling tone as Olivia works so well to explore their differing perspectives on the same situation. Where The Off Key needs a little more work is dramaturgically. The timeframe of the show is a little murky and initial references to lockdown don’t help. And Mackie suffers a little from Jason-Robert-Brown-in-The-Last-Five-Years-itis in fleshing out his male character more than his female. There’s an extraordinary moment midway through the show in which we learn so much about Sam, and Mackie absolutely nails it, seizing the chance to deepen this man beyond the confines of the central relationship. Olivia is granted no such similar room for development and it would be good to see this balance redressed to fully round out the world of the show, especially given how refreshingly forthright the character is written by Mackie and performed by Glynn-Whitehead."
1047,1047,Ought To Be Clowns,12/03/2014,mag9l,Good People, Hampstead Theatre,"As if there was any doubt that Imelda Staunton wouldn’t be excellent in Good People… Though the way that she inhabits the part of Margie, a hard-bitten, working-class Bostonian single mother is simply quite astonishing. From the opening moments of this David Lindsay-Abaire play as she faces the prospect of losing the job that is barely keeping her afloat due to the desperation of forlorn hope etched on her face at the end, it is a sensational performance in the midst of a sensational production. Jobs are few and far between in the tough neighbourhood of South Boston and the demands of caring for her disabled daughter mean Margie needs to seize the bull by the horns to get alternative employment. When she hears from a friend that Mike, an old flame is back in town – someone who has definitely gone up in the world to become a doctor – she batters down his door and procures a birthday party invite where apparently somebody might have something for her. Naturally, it doesn’t quite unfold like that, Margie’s spiky determination leading to a blistering second act confrontation which is just magnificent and is that rare thing, a dissection of American class politics. Staunton brings an unerring conviction to her idea of what makes a ‘good’ person and it transpires Lloyd Owen’s excellently blinkered Mike has fallen short. Faced with the evidence he has whitewashed from his past, the difference in their lives could not be any starker. Their debate is brilliantly drawn, incorporating the reality of social mobility, the importance (or otherwise) of remembering your roots, the role of the family environment in one’s upbringing, the desperation that financial hardship brings that the well-off can never truly understand. Mike’s college professor wife Kate adds additional levels, coming from money and of African-American descent, showing that the class system in the US is just as mutable and complex as in the UK. Lindsay-Abaire also fills the stage with an astute portrayal of the coping mechanisms and rituals that working class life. So Margie has two pragmatic but loyal friends in the shape of June Watson and an excellent Lorraine Ashbourne, the local bingo hall is presented as a refuge from the realities of life and a place of modest dreams, and the whole thing also crackles with a fiercely sharp sense of humour."
1048,1048,Ought To Be Clowns,12/09/2010,Ian,Punk Rock, Lyric Hammersmith,"Returning to the Lyric Hammersmith for a two week run before a national tour, Punk Rock premiered a year ago to great success and introduced me to great performances from the likes of Tom Sturridge and Henry Lloyd-Hughes, but particularly Jessica Raine who is tearing up the stage at the National in Earthquakes in London and is my tip for great things in the near future. It is the same production team here but with a rejigged cast, three originals remain with a sea of new faces, two of whom are making their professional stage debuts. Set in a private school in Stockport and following some sixth-formers over a few months as they deal with the pressures of mock A-Levels and the tantalising glimpse of university and the freedom from their current life it offers. It sweeps over a range of teen issues, bullying both by text and physically, inappropriate crushes, fears about the future and university, sexual confusion, self-harming, in an impressive manner, never lingering too long on any but not patronising them either as the relationships between them become the focal point as we reach the shocking climax. Looking back at my original review, it’s interesting how much I was influenced by the audience. It was full of teenagers and even now my abiding memory of the show is just being appalled at their behaviour, so it was nice to experience with a (sadly quite small) well behaved crowd at Saturday’s matinée. Paul Wills’ design is highly atmospheric: a dark imposing circular library with towering shelves and remarkable depth, the action is played on tables and chairs upfront but it is a most effective backdrop with bursts of music by the likes of Sonic Youth and the White Stripes punctuating the scene changes. Rupert Simonian did an excellent job as William, shepherding us through this minefield of hormones and unexploded tensions, capturing his quicksilver mood swings well and delivering the climax most effectively: at times, he reminded me of a young Martin Freeman. Laura Pyper as Lilly was all kinds of brilliant with an intriguing performance full of energy and curiosity: it just annoys me that her character is given so little to do in the second half of the play. Edward Franklin as Bennett didn’t quite capture the requisite convincing menace as bullyboy Bennett but I couldn’t get Henry Lloyd-Hughes’ performance out of my head so I’m probably unfairly comparing them. Of the returnees, the ridiculously good-looking Nicholas Banks as Nick and Katie West as the sweet Tanya remained strong supporting presences and the debutants Ruth Milne and in particular Mike Noble were very good. The show felt pretty much note for note the same but it was really interesting to see it again: knowing how the finale plays out, one sees the hints and clues much more clearly, the sociopathy, the homoeroticism, the sense that any adolescent crisis feels like the end of the world. However, I found the decision to insert an interval curious: where the break hits give the last line of the first half a much more ominous feel which was unexpectedly good, but I feel the play benefits from the unrelenting tightening of the screw that playing straight through offers."
1049,1049,Ought To Be Clowns,22/05/2020,Ian,The Sound of Music Live (The Show Must Go On),,"In some ways, turning to the series of live TV musicals to continue The Show Must Go On now that Andrew Lloyd Webber has exhausted the content he is willing to give for free, for weekends at a time. The problem is, its opening salvo – The Sound of Music Live from 2013 – really isn’t a good example of the form.  Directed by Rob Ashford and Beth McCarthy-Miller, it has all the requisite component parts and as a piece of live entertainment, it is all very competently done. There’s an impressively capacious set, slick camerawork and a well-drilled ensemble who barely put a foot wrong throughout the 2 hours plus of the show. The problem, and it is a massive one, is in casting singer Carrie Underwood as Maria, whose lack of acting experience is cruelly exposed in practically every frame, and who shares zero chemistry with Stephen Moyer’s Captain. The pair are a black hole at the heart of this broadcast, sucking life and enjoyment from the whole thing."
1050,1050,Ought To Be Clowns,19/02/2018,Ian,The B*easts, Bush,"There’s a temptation to raise an eyebrow when a well-known actor gets a writing commission. 2013’s The Herd was a perfectly decent play but would it have got the same attention were it not written by Rory Kinnear? Who knows. Also at the Bush, we now have Monica Dolan’s The B*easts but over an intense hour, there’s little doubt about the quality here. Dolan’s monologue takes a long hard look at how the increased sexualisation that has seeped into the very marrow of Western society and how not even our children are immune from its effects. She plays Tessa, a psychotherapist who has been called in to assess a mother who has been placed under the spotlight for allowing her daughter to have breast implants. Her daughter who is eight years old.  It’s a canny format as the very nature of Tessa’s intervention is one of a desire to probe into the issue, understand it rather than race to judgement.  It turns out the young Lila actually was the one who wanted the surgery and that emerges as a fascinating thread – who is responsible for the awakening of such desire. Clickbait-chasing journalists have alighted on the ‘easy’ victim of Lila’s mother Karen, issues of class factoring in too as vitriol and opprobrium are hurled her way. But Tessa guides us through the hypocrisy of a media who profit so much from promoting borderline-criminal sexual imagery at every opportunity from music videos to magazine covers.  Dolan also layers in Tessa’s own life experiences with the device of an ever-ringing mobile phone, through which the role of breasts as a sexual signifier and the weight that a patriarchal society accords them is further explored. This varies the rhythm of John Hoggarth’s production, not by much but enough to stop the piece from feeling too static. And with Dolan in scintillating form with her effortless naturalism, this proves an intelligently provocative play. "

1052,1052,Ought To Be Clowns,24/09/2011,Ian,The Baker’s Wife, Union Theatre,"The Baker’s Wife with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Joseph Stein is a musical that managed to develop something of a cult following despite flopping in the West End in 1989 and never actually having run on Broadway. Director Michael Strassen has now given it a rare outing at the small-scale powerhouse that is the Union Theatre. Based on the Marcel Pagnol and Jean Giano film La Femme Du Boulanger, the show is all about what happens in a rural French community when Geneviève the young wife of the village baker leaves her husband Aimable for a sexy piece of rough. He loses his baking mojo which sufficiently outrages the villagers to put aside their multifarious squabbles to come together and try to reunite the couple. There is usually a reason that shows are left on the shelf and true to form, The Baker’s Wife pretty shows us why. Schwartz’s score is largely strong with some genuinely sublime moments but the book is stolid, unimaginative and fatally fragmented. Too much time is spent on the villagers around the love triangle but there’s so many of them, all contributing to the larger metaphor of the show, that none get a fair crack of the whip. And consequently, there’s not enough room to really focus on the main protagonists either. Indeed, Geneviève’s story doesn’t come across as particularly sympathetic at all, it is so hurried: it is revealed that she married Aimable on the rebound from being rejected by her married lover but she’s going to put up with him. Having left him shortly after singing this, she then dumps her new paramour after five minutes on the run and a roll in the hay – one can’t help but feel the baker is better off without her! Matters are not helped by an additional horribly overdone metaphor of her cat running away and returning contemporaneously, subtle it is not. But Strassen’s production doesn’t always help itself either. Michael Matus, available due to the early closure of Lend Me A Tenor, is canny casting as the baker with his rumpled good looks and excellent voice but, and being as gentlemanly as I can about it, Lisa Stokke as his wife just does not seem to be sufficiently younger than him to cause all the comments. If every other line from a villager weren’t “My God, she’s so young for him” one would be hard-pressed to notice. Stokke does act superbly and sing beautifully though, so is well cast in every other respect. And then there’s Matthew Goodgame as Dominique, the sexy villager for whom she tumbles. He’s caught a little bit between a show that can’t decide if its protagonist is just after an illicit liaison with something hot or whether something deeper in her has been awakened by this man: Goodgame’s Colgate smile and tanned abs fulfilling the first quite easily but never really convincing that the second is an option. And then there’s the villagers, a set of ‘characters’ all with their own little character traits, mainly bickering, which tiresomely run on throughout the show – indeed they end up being the focus of the second act – adding little but trying the patience considerably. Ricky Butt’s Denise is the best here, given something of a narrator role and the warmth with which she passes commentary, especially on the foibles of men, is one of the show’s highlights. But elsewhere odd pieces of staging and ill-advised moves into choreography and meta-theatre fall flat and given such caricatures by the material, the company struggle to make us care for their concerns. And why is the bread all wrapped in cling film? Given that a pint of milk is thrown onto the floor later on, I’d’ve said it was worth sweeping up the crumbs at the end rather than the odd image of people caressing shrink-wrapped rolls and baguettes.  "
1053,1053,Ought To Be Clowns,01/04/2011,Ian,The Children’s Hour, Comedy Theatre,"After her (somewhat surprisingly) Olivier-nominated turn in The Misanthrope, Keira Knightley has returned to the same West End stage at the Comedy Theatre to further stretch her dramatic wings in a production of Lillian Hellman’s The Children’s Hour which also features the London stage debut of Ellen Burstyn, plus Carol Kane, Elizabeth Moss and a host of UK actresses in a rare play full of meaty parts for women. I hadn’t originally intended to see this show, the inflated ticket prices proving a step too far for a desperately uncomfortable theatre, especially in the (now no longer) cheap seats, but the offer from a kind soul to do the queuing for the £15 day seats meant that we ended up on the front row (A2&3) on a rainy Wednesday afternoon to be quite pleasantly surprised. Set in 1930s New England at a small boarding school run by Karen and Martha, two women who after years of hard work and building up the school, are finally secure enough to begin looking at other things in life, in the case of Karen, marrying her patient fiancé. The only cloud on the horizon is problem child Mary, a massively disruptive influence and constant troublemaker who after yet another punishment is doled out to her, decides to run away to her grandmother’s house. But when an argument between Martha and her dippy aunt turns particularly rancorous with accusations of unnatural feelings towards Karen and is overheard by some of the other schoolgirls who pass on the tidbit to Mary, the malevolent child accuses her teachers of being secret lovers. It’s a charge which the grandmother takes deadly seriously, encouraging all the parents to withdraw their children and thereby threatening the very livelihood of the two women as they battle to clear their name. Bryony Hannah works the same sort of tomboyish feel that she employed in Earthquakes in London to create a really rather vicious portrayal of the accusatory, manipulative Mary. It is astonishingly effective but almost too good though, too sharply defined as a demonic troublemaker as it makes it hard to believe that anyone, even Ellen Burstyn’s doting grandmother, would believe her stories. Burstyn is superb as the ageing grande dame, so convincingly blinded with love for her ward that she believes her unquestioningly. She also delivers the pre-show mobile phone advisory message which, although a small thing, was a really nice touch. I was less keen on Carol Kane’s kooky teacher, a little too overdramatic and over-egged in her performance for my liking. But the real interest of the show for me was in the relationship between Karen and Martha and the way it is impacted by the accusations and it is excellently done by Elizabeth Moss and Keira Knightley. I’ve always liked Knightley anyway, despite what so many others think, but Ian Hickson really does tease something out of her here that I think would silence a large proportion of the naysayers with a devastating extended final scene as relationship after relationship finally crumbles under the strain, her work with Tobias Menzies here is the best, though most painfully heartbreaking, moment of the show, Knightley finding a truly tragic depth as her world collapses. And Moss is also strong with the more inscrutable Martha, whose hidden depths suggest that nothing is quite as clear-cut as it seems here, hinting at secrets with her ever-so-subtle nuances and half-hidden movements."

1056,1056,Ought To Be Clowns,22/07/2017,Ian,Fiddler on the Roof, Chichester Festival Theatre,"Though my life has long been filled with musicals, Fiddler on the Roof has never been the one. I’ve only ever seen it the once (2013’s touring version) and though I quite enjoyed it then, I can’t say I was hankering after seeing another production. And though Daniel Evans’ hands are sure indeed when it comes to classic musicals, I found something rather uninspired both about the choice of programming it for his new Chichester home (although it is an absolute banker) and in his production. It is perfectly decent, and the quality is solidly good throughout. Omid Djalili is an effective presence as Tevye, Tracy-Ann Oberman is very good as Golde, and it is always nice to see Louis Maskell onstage. But Evans is a director (and artistic director) who has made my heart sing with glorious revivals such as My Fair Lady and Show Boat (and Company and Me and My Girl) and I missed that kind of magic emanating from the unforgiving vastness of the Chichester Festival Theatre’s main stage."

1058,1058,Ought To Be Clowns,08/12/2019,Ian,Whistle Down the Wind, Union Theatre,"Do miracles happen in Burnley? You might not have immediately thought so but Whistle Down the Wind begs to differ. Russell Labey and Richard Taylor’s adaptation, as distinct from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jim Steinman’s, draws variously on Mary Hayley Bell’s novel, Willis Hall and Keith Waterhouse’s screenplay and Richard Attenborough and Bryan Forbes’ film to tell its own version of Jesus appearing once again in a stable, kinda sort of maybe.  Cathy, Nan and Charles are three Lancashire schoolkids who one day find a strange man in their barn. Rumours of a convict on the loose are swirling around their village but Cathy immediately clocks him as our Lord Jesus Christ and swears her siblings to secrecy. Sure enough, word soon spreads around the other local kids but as they all decide to keep the secret too, delighting in the rapturous devotion he, or He, inspires in them.   Ultimately, the show is a rather slight thing but given as tender a production as it is here by Sasha Regan, it has a twinkling grace about it. Led by a stonkingly good professional debut from Sadie Levett as Cathy and supported by the equally effective Tara Lucas and George Hankers, a world of childlike wonder is sensitively evoked without ever seeming icky, their youth played with a real integrity. Juan Miralles also impresses as the man who has enraptured them all. "
1059,1059,Ought To Be Clowns,29/09/2018,Ian,Hogarth’s Progress, Rose Theatre Kingston,"The oft-misquoted George Santayana once said “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” and taking a glance at Nick Dear’s Hogarth’s Progress, you can’t help but feel it is most apposite for the folks at the Rose Theatre Kingston. Once again, they’re tackling a slice of English history in a multi-play format and once again, they’re doing it with a lily-white cast – diversity be damned!  It’s a bit exhausting to go over the same arguments but they still hold true. The notion of historical verisimilitude holds no water, not least because Dear has talked about employing dramatic licence with history itself, but because once again we’re not talking about German actresses being employed to play Queen Caroline (it is Susannah Harker, with an accent). We’re talking about directors not trusting that audiences will accept actors of colour in such roles, but also not doing enough to challenge such audience-held perceptions. At a moment when British theatre seems to be heading in the right direction (Emilia, Sylvia, Queen Margaret, Wasted), this feels misguided by director Anthony Banks. In a theatre that was mired in a similar controversy just a couple of years ago, it feels wilfully ignorant. A regional theatre does have to take the conservatism (small c) of its patrons into account but equally, this is the 21st century and if theatre ignores the shifts in the social fabric, it can’t hope to survive and thrive.  With all this in mind, Nick Dear’s double bill Hogarth’s Progress, combining his 1986 play The Art of Success with a world premiere in The Taste of the Town, thus has a lot to do. Tracking the life of painter William Hogarth at two crucial points in his career, thirty years apart, they each stand alone but can be enjoyed as an all-day marathon. Both are slight comedies though, revelling in his predilection for a drink, so altogether it can feel like a lot. The Art of Success was my preferred of the two, anchored by its own version of BDE (Bryan Dick energy…what else?!), as he rattles between his wife and numerous lovers, all the while spearheading a movement to secure copyright law for artists. Under the giant screen that dominates Andrew D Edwards’ set design (video and projection by Douglas O), Dick is well supported by strong turns from Ruby Bentall, Emma Cunniffe and Jasmine Jones as just some of the women in his life. Plus there’s a bawdy Sylvestra Le Touzel, she’s very good. The Taste of the Town felt less successful to me, relying a little too much on Keith Allen being Keith Allen for my tastes. 30 years down the line, the Hogarths’ marriage has remained intact, his career going from strength and strength, and yet he remains unsatisfied. There’s little of the same energy here, so much less at stake, and more of a self-satisfied railing against critics. Striking work does come from Mark Umbers’ as a foppish David Garrick. "
1060,1060,Ought To Be Clowns,08/06/2015,mag9l,Teddy, Southwark Playhouse,"Not quite a musical, more a play with songs; and not quite a play, more free verse. The Southwark Playhouse’s Teddy may defy simple categorisation but it is easy to say that it is one of the more adventurous shows opening in London this week and consequently one of the more exciting. Not only that, get to the theatre 15 minutes early and there’s a pre-show gig from in-house band Johnny Valentine and The Broken Hearts – it’s all kicking off down the Elephant and Castle. Tristan Bernays’ tale ducks and dives through the Saturday night experiences of Teddy and Josie, teenagers in a 1950s London still bearing the scars of a decade before but one in which an exciting, if dangerous, new scene is emerging. Coming out of a time of real austerity – 14 years on rations – the subculture of Teddy boys and girls spoke of rebellion, liberation and the determination to shake up the social order, all soundtracked by the newly revolutionary music of rock’n’roll. Joseph Prowen and Jennifer Kirby crackle with real electricity as this pair, caught up in the excitement of something new but also increasingly tangled in something much darker. Their incipient romance is sparky and sweet, lending the later twists a poignant gravitas, but real atmosphere comes too from Dougal Irvine’s songs. They don’t just sit alongside the action but thread their lifeforce through the story and the show as much as any traditional score."

1062,1062,Ought To Be Clowns,15/04/2010,Ian,Rufus Wainwright’s Prima Donna, Sadler’s Wells,"I’m not much of an opera-goer it must be said, but I have been a fan of Rufus Wainwright for a long time now and I have huge respect for people who fearlessly stretch their creative boundaries: names come to mind like Juliette Binoche taking on Akram Khan and dance in in-i, Damon Albarn’s own opera Monkey and even Graham Norton assuming the role of Zaza in La Cage aux Folles, these are artists willing to take risks in the face of harsh critics and a judgemental public, and I applaud them for following their creative instincts. To add to this list now is Rufus Wainwright, whose opera Prima Donna plays at Sadler’s Wells for four shows after its premiere in Manchester last year. It arrives in London though with a new director and a substantial redesign. Prima Donna follows a day in the life of an opera singer, Régine Saint Laurent, who was the grande dame of Paris opera yet has not sung a note in six years after a crisis when performing Aliénor d’Aquitaine, a piece written for her especially. Sequestered away in a reclusive life with just a long-serving butler Philippe and a new maid Marie for company, she is struggling to face the demons that haunt her, yet a journalist André coming to interview awakens her desire to recapture her life on the stage. The concept is more interesting than the execution to be honest, the idea of what an artist becomes once their talent has deserted them is hinted at but not mined in any great detail and the first half does begin to flag somewhat in the face of little action. The second act though is much livelier as it becomes a bit of a mystery and we are genuinely engaged in discovering what lies behind the diva’s pain. The staging reflects the fading grandeur of its star, her crumbling apartment peeling at the edges, paint fading, furniture battered and worn and it is beautifully lit throughout. Musically, it carries a lot of different influences and is quite reminiscent of Wainwright’s ‘pop’ music in this respect. There are some beautiful moments, an early duet between Régine and Marie is exquisite (I would have personally liked to heard more group and less solo work, the climactic love duet from Aliénor is nicely dramatic and also wonderfully staged, I found it entirely captivating. Ironically, Prima Donna is at its strongest when at its simplest: Régine and André singing along to the piano; a haunting, spare number from Philippe about his long-held devotion to his mistress; even the final number is all the more effective for being tenderly gentle. I found all the vocal performances to be good, Rebecca Bottone’s higher register was excellently deployed in her second act opener, Jonathan Summers gruffly humourous butler was nicely characterised and as the Prima Donna herself, Janis Kelly was superb, being an enchanting singer but also squeezing out every last drop of drama and emotion, especially when her voice failed her. Sometimes though, there is just too much going on with the music, with little thematic consistency emerging from the evening, it can get a little bit wearing. And for me, I found the balance was sometimes questionable. The Royal Ballet Sinfonia, conducted by Robert Houssart, played extremely well, dealing with an often densely complex score but the orchestra was often the dominant sound in the mix at the expense of the vocal work, even sometimes with two singers and it really felt at times like Wainwright was more interested in the score rather than the vocal line. Matters are not much helped by a libretto which is hardly complex. My evening was hugely enhanced by a chance conversation with the lady next to me, who turned out to be the repetiteur (the programme says Annette Saunders) and she won me over completely with her passion for opera in general and her explanations of several key points I quizzed her on (including a little backstage gossip!) and if she ever reads this, I like to thank her for her time and her suggestions. One of the key reasons I don’t see much opera is my lack of keen opera-going friends, I think I need to go with someone who is passionate and can carry me along with their enthusiasm, explaining the nuances and intricacies that escape my uneducated ear, so this encounter made this a special evening for me. I suspect aficionados of opera will find this too much of a vanity project, not matching up to the works it is influenced by, and I can see why some would argue that the publicity and resources being made available could have been more fairly allocated to more established full-time upcoming opera writers, but I feel that that would be unfair to Rufus Wainwright’s efforts here, an engaging night out and one which will pull in an audience who might not otherwise have bothered with opera and could be inspired to discover more. Interesting review. I wasn't a fan to tell the  truth, stylistically it's all over the place and even the basic story is not one worth telling really. But still, a good first effort at creating a new opera from someone outside the field, which is a hell of a lot more than what most critics have achieved."
1063,1063,Ought To Be Clowns,27/02/2018,Ian,Curtains, Rose Theatre Kingston,"Stephen Bill’s 1987 play Curtains feels at once a curious choice to revive and yet an appropriate play for the Rose Kingston, a theatre that often seems to be searching for its audience, or at least the right material to put in front of it. Curtains has a play-of-the-day feel to it as it seeks to deal with its big issue and in some ways, achieves a measure of success. The issue at hand is euthanasia. Ida’s family is celebrating her 86th birthday around her but it’s her party, she’ll cry if she wants to, for old age has ravaged her pain-wracked body and dementia is starting to take its toll. And as her three daughters and associated friends and family members gather round, cracks begin to show in their determination to have a good time.  
There’s more than a whiff of sitcom about the first half but there’s also a scorching insight into the infantilisation that accompanies old age, as best displayed in the utter condescension about where a new thermometer should go. Sandra Voe shows us all the isolation and desolation that comes with being that comes of being stripped of dignity – by family members as much as illness. After the interval, after a grisly deed is done, the writing becomes a little more didactic as the conversation switches to a debate on the morality of euthanasia and more generally, the way in which we treat the elderly in this country (an issue as pressing 30 years ago as it is now). And with the accompanying lack of subtlety or any real dynamism – Curtains never leaves the front room of Ida’s Midlands terrace – a little of the play’s power dissipates.    Lindsay Posner’s production is very well cast though and this level of quality papers over several of these cracks. Saskia Reeves (in full-on Lady Di garb and ‘do) and Wendy Nottingham as the elder two daughters are both fearsomely good as familial solidarity crumbles under pressure. Caroline Catz also impresses as the youngest, returning from a long period of estrangement to the family home, dressed perfectly in clashing patterns and overstuffed with knick-knacks by designer Peter McKintosh."

Michael Longhurst’s production was first seen in Chichester last May (here’s my review) and whilst it is a shame that that original cast aren’t all present here (the glorious Nicola Hughes, Gloria Onitiri, Jennifer Saayeng all now elsewhere), it holds on to the titanic talents of Sharon D Clarke as Caroline Thibideaux.  Words can barely to justice to the way she inhabits the role of this African-American maid in a white Jewish household in 1963 Louisiana, suffused with melancholy at the hopelessness of her situation, even while society promises to shift around her. For her world doesn’t seem to be able to change at all, particularly when the (monetary) change of a child gets involved."

1067,1067,Ought To Be Clowns,15/01/2010,Ian,Six Degrees of Separation, Old Vic,"John Guare’s Six Degrees of Separation receives its first revival in 18 years with this David Grindley directed production at the Old Vic. Based on a true story of a conman finagling his way into the lives of wealthy Manhattan socialites by pretending to be the son of Sidney Poitier, we see the lives of two New York art dealers, Ouisa and Fran Kittredge turned upside down after they take an injured Paul into their home and he wreaks havoc on their lives and those of them around them as he challenges their comfortable existences. It is kept in its original 1980s setting, presumably as the issues around financial greed are as pertinent today, even if those around race and homosexuality are less so. Onstage narration seems to be the flavour of the month and it is a tricky thing to get right: Innocence fails, Midsummer gets it right, here is somewhere in the middle. There’s a mixture of Ouisa and Fran, and indeed other characters, narrating the events and the action being played out, and I’m not sure the balance is wholly there: it is just so much more entertaining when the actors are engaging with each other and I was frequently left wanting to see more of that.
Anthony Head suffered the most from this structure, his rather one-note performance doesn’t really have anywhere to go, and his only character progression is to rediscover a love for art, but due to him spending a fair amount of time narrating, his initial disaffection just isn’t shown sufficiently. Obi Abili as the duplicitous, seductive cuckoo in the nest Paul is better though not as convincing as he should be in the one scene as his ‘true’ self and there’s some good comedic work from the actors playing the spoiled children with their laconic sense of entitlement and ennui. As the central Ouisa, Lesley Manville is very good, artfully playing the awakening from her complacency and the growth of the character. But, and I hate people who do this yet here I am, I couldn’t escape the lingering feeling that it owed too much to Stockard Channing’s original performance or perhaps that it wasn’t distinct enough. Manville is far from bad, I was just hoping for more from an actress whom I love."

1069,1069,Ought To Be Clowns,26/03/2015,mag9l,The Three Lions, St James,"With the fallout of FIFA’s decisions of where to have the 2018 and 2022 World Cups still percolating around footballing bureaucrats even now, one could probably find more than enough material for a verbatim play full of high drama – alleged bribery and corruption, the tragedy of migrant working conditions, war-mongering presidents, seismic calendar shifts from summer to winter. William Gaminara’s The Three Lions wisely sidesteps that potential controversy though, by imagining a behind-the-scenes farce involving the trio spearheading the English bid to host the 2018 competition – three blokes by the name of David Cameron, David Beckham and Prince William. In representing three such well-known figures, Dugald Bruce-Lockhart, Séan Browne and Tom Davey have to tread a fine line between impersonation and inhabiting their characters more fully and Gaminara’s script doesn’t always allow for this. Davey’s lanky Prince William becomes an improbable japester as he desperately tries to shake off his inbred stiffness and grammatical pedantry and be one of the lads. And Bruce-Lockhart gets the PM’s blustering and patronising tone just right, matching it with the overcompensatory physical language that belies innate insecurity. But they both get overshadowed by a work of comic genius in Browne’s footballer. The constant look of bemusement as his brain tries to catch up with the events that go on around him is just brilliant, one can see just how slowly but steadily his thought processes work and Browne nails the timing on every occasion. It is (mostly) affectionately done too, his simple logic not always easily dismissed, and it is a performance that lifts the whole show. Concerned with the backroom shenanigans that accompanies securing the votes of the FIFA committee members, Gaminara imagines a series of increasingly farcical goings-on in a Zurich hotel room in 2010 which require no footballing knowledge to enjoy and fitfully prove most entertaining."

Director Ian Rickson is looking to address that with Conor McPherson’s adaptation of The Nest, first seen in Belfast and now playing at the Young Vic, with music provided by the estimable PJ Harvey.  It’s a sparsely intense two-hander starring Caoilfhionn Dunne and Laurence Kinlan as Martha and Kurt, a young Irish couple starting a family and wondering how they’ll cope with the financial strain of it.

1072,1072,Ought To Be Clowns,24/03/2015,mag9l,Return to the Forbidden Planet, New Wimbledon,"Early 2015 is turning out to be something of a nostalgia-fest for me as following the Royal Exchange’s superb revival of Little Shop of Horrors is another of the first shows that I came to love as a child – Return to the Forbidden Planet. I can’t recall exactly how many time my sisters, Aunty Jean and I must have seen this show but every time its tour came near us we were there, reversing polarity and loving it every time. Consequently, I have huge affection for the show, even though it is many years since I last saw it, and so naturally the notion of a 25th anniversary tour was one I could not resist as it came into my orbit at the New Wimbledon. For those without such prior knowledge, Return to the Forbidden Planet is a schlocky sci-fi B-movie version of The Tempest, complete with a rock’n’roll jukebox soundtrack. Not only that, there’s video narration by Brian May. cod-Shakespearean dialogue and any number of quotations lifted from other plays by the Bard and repurposed to intergalactic effect. So a routine space mission led by Captain Tempest gets diverted to a mysterious rock called D’Illyria (“what planet, friends, is this…”) after getting caught in a meteor storm (“goodness, gracious, great balls of fire…”) where they meet the mad Doctor Prospero, his robot servant Ariel and his innocent daughter Miranda. From thence, a typically Shakespearean tangle of all-consuming love, misplaced affections and space monsters spills forth with not a single opportunity to shoehorn in a song missed – when Miranda falls for the Captain, she laments being ‘A Teenager in Love’; when the feisty Science Officer faces misogyny onboard the ship, only ‘It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World’ can express how she feels, etc etc. With a hugely talented actor-musician ensemble – some playing up to 8 instruments – delivering the music, it can be a thrilling piece of theatre to behold (especially to as impressionable a teenage mind as was mine). Equally though, there are longueurs in writer, creator and director Bob Carlton’s production when he lets the energy slip too much, the comic zest giving way to a somewhat bloated feel wherein trimming a chorus or two or a laboured quote or three might sharpen up the whole affair. For when it is funny, it’s very entertaining – Mark Newnham’s hapless Cookie is a scene-stealing delight, his exit through the airlock a definite comic highlight, Jonathan Markwood’s crazy eyes as Doctor Prospero are to die for, Steve Simmonds is an endlessly reassuring presence as the reliable Bosun, and Christine Holman’s Science Officer-with-a-past also impresses."
1073,1073,Ought To Be Clowns,04/11/2010,Ian,Macbeth, Song of the Goat at the Barbican,"Pulling together elements of Corsican chanting, poetry, Korean instrumentation, dance, Japanese-style robes, movement inspired by martial arts training and much manipulation of wooden staffs, Song of the Goat’s hypnotic and mesmerising retelling of Macbeth plays in the Pit at the Barbican after a UK tour which will also see them visit Brighton after this residency. It is an immersive experience suffused with a primal energy that takes you to the heart of the show, revealing new layers with a piercing emotional directness. To be sure, it isn’t a straight retelling of the play as it is known, indeed it is more accurate to describe it as something like a rhapsody on a theme of Macbeth: it is probably not one for the purists given the amount of editing and cutting here and the occasional dip into obscurity that results, one needs to approach this almost without prior expectation or knowledge in order to just embrace what they are trying to achieve.There’s a beautiful blend of the interpretative sequences with the more recognisable moments which really works: it always feels like Macbeth with familiar scenes and lines of dialogue coming into focus yet it also delves down into something more, a stronger essence of dark magic and tragedy that somehow feels compellingly authentic. One of the key starting points for this exploration of Macbeth has been the deep interrogation of the musicality of the text, its pulsing rhythm and cadences and their deep understanding of this allows them to jettison so much of the famous prose in favour of a leaner approach focused around music. Accompanied by Rafal Habel’s accomplished kayagum playing, a Korean string instrument sounding akin to the sitar with its tremulous rippling of sound, the haunting polyphonic Corsican folk songs that are sung throughout play the hugest part in transporting us elsewhere during the running time. Quite where I am not sure, it is at once otherworldly and magical, yet all-too-human in its evocations of impassioned, wailing grief, familiar to so many cultures if not the English. Gabriel Gawin’s potent Macbeth is excellent, sketching out a persuasive viciousness to his relationship with his wife and the clear-sighted brutality of their chosen path. And Anna Zubrzycki’s Lady Macbeth is just outstanding: her ‘out out damn spot…’ is one of the most haunting things I’ve seen all year, the way in which she modulates her voice in the descent into madness a particular highlight and the choice to keep her onstage ‘til the end makes perfect sense here, her wailing and keening over her husband’s body making a lasting final visual and auditory impact. Ian Morgan’s Macduff is also beautifully played and Anu Salonen’s ululations as a witch highly affecting. The Barbican really does have a knack of identifying European companies who are really challenging the way in which Shakespeare is presented: last year Toneelgroep Amsterdam’s presentation of The Roman Tragedies was hands down the most innovative and exhilrating experience of the year and this year Song of the Goat have come very close to achieving the same in their novel reimagining of this classic. Perhaps it is not a fair comparison, but ultimately I found this a much more truthful example of the distillation of Shakespeare’s works than as seen in Cheek By Jowl’s Macbeth or even Filter’s Twelfth Night both of which tended towards the self-indulgent for me: I honestly believe that this is a production that the Bard himself could have envisioned, in its utter commitment to the ensemble and to the integrity of the vision behind this interpretation. Running time: 70 minutes (without interval)
 Programme cost: free
 Booking until 20th November Agreed. Having let it soak in for a few days I can honestly say it is one of the most affecting productions I've seen this year. A real shame that this won't be seen by as many people as it should (though quite pleasing to be one of the few to witness it). Can still hear Lady Macbeth's wailing! i couldn't decide whether it was mesmerisingly brilliant or absolute gash. the more i think about it, i'm leaning towards the latter. to have lady macbeth onstage, mourning at the end, reimagining of the shakespearean text or not, just did not work. moreover, lady macbeth was entirely unconvincing. a shame – there were some superb moments; the killing of macbeth is the best i've seen, and the musical accompaniment was glorious. but it still fell short. That's a shame, as I do think it was much better than you give it credit for and personally I thought Zubrzycki’s Lady Macbeth was incredible. The trick is to dissociate it from what you know of Shakespeare's narrative and just embrace what they are trying to do for itself: it took me ages to work out who was Banquo but ultimately it didn't really matter and as a meditation on grief, I thought the final scene was just stunning and entirely appropriate."
1074,1074,Ought To Be Clowns,17/09/2018,Ian,Flowers for Mrs Harris, Chichester Festival Theatre,"I had much love for Flowers for Mrs Harris when it premiered in Sheffield a couple of years ago, and so I was delighted to see Daniel Evans deciding to revive it at his new abode over in Chichester. My only cavil came with the placing of this most heartfelt musical in the vast space of the Festival Theatre rather than the intimacy of the Minerva where it might perhaps have been better served. So much of the beauty of the show (book by Rachel Wagstaff from Paul Gallico’s novel, music & lyrics by Richard Taylor) comes from the fact that it isn’t a bells and whistles epic. It is something far more subtle that truly celebrates the ordinary in extraordinary, as Clare Burt’s charlady Ada Harris dares to dream of owning a Christian Dior dress and in working to achieve that dream, illuminates the lives of those around her.   Largely sung-through, the cumulative effect of Flowers for Mrs Harris is like a ripple billowing through a length of silk fabric, flipping it over – beguiling and beautiful, gentle but ultimately transformative. As Ada’s hard work takes her from Battersea to Paris, some nifty doubling in the cast sees her meeting contrasting figures to those for whom she toils. So Louis Maskell switches from accountant to dreamy photographer, Laura Pitt-Pulford from struggling actress to top model, Joanna Riding aristocracy to couturier, and all impress with their clear delineation.   And Burt is just magnificent the unassuming Ada, slowly coming to realise her place in the world, her worth and her right to a greater happiness than she ever dared dream of in the drudgery of post-war Britain. Lez Brotherston’s design looks superb under Mark Henderson’s well-observed lighting choices, and the conclusion is a thing of real, gentle wonder. Don’t just talk about wanting to see new exciting British musical theatre, go and see it now!"
1075,1075,Ought To Be Clowns,24/01/2013,Ian,Port, National Theatre,"He’s here, he’s there, Simon Stephens is everywhere. Between a prolific rate of new writing, adaptations of other texts and revivals of his older work, Stephens has been a remarkably constant presence on our stages for the past year or so and now it is the turn of the National Theatre to get in on the act as Marianne Elliott revives his 2002 play Port. Set in his native Stockport, it visits Racheal at roughly two-yearly intervals from the ages of 11 through to 24, as she grows up in a rough world.  A victim of domestic violence, her mother leaves the family; a juvenile delinquent with a taste for robbing, her younger brother just can’t keep out of trouble; disillusioned with his lot, her father is still present but has checked out emotionally; against all of this Racheal plots to escape the narrow world of Stockport through hard work, through marriage, through whatever it takes but of course, life is never that easy as cold reality comes a-knocking at the door every time. The role of Racheal is a huge ask for an actress, on stage throughout the entire play and ageing 13 years in the process, but fortunately the winner of the 2012 fosterIAN for Best Actress in a Play – Kate O’Flynn – was available and proves more than up to the part. Her natural ebullience carries her through the younger scenes well but there’s a gravitas, a grittiness which underscores her every action so that when her plans invariably go askew, the pragmatic clicks in automatically and the way O’Flynn conveys this enforced spiritedness is astounding and highly affecting. Mike Noble as her brother Billy is also persuasively powerful as a portrait of disaffected youth in whom the damage has struck deeper than his older sibling, unable to escape the world in which he has found himself. There’s some clever doubling in the supporting roles too, which further pushes the feeling of insularity in this world. Liz White (sadly under-used for my liking) is desperately affecting as the struggling mother, so it is a delicately touching moment when she reappears as the ailing grandmother. And likewise, Jack Deam makes a chillingly authentic domineering father so that when his second role turns out to be of a less-than-ideal husband for Rachael, the cycle of abuse seems doomed to repeat itself.   For me though, the episodic nature of the play resulted in an unevenness across the whole play even through the killer soundtrack of Mancunian tunes. Some of the scenes are much more affecting than others (one wonders if some sharpening may still occur before opening night as it ran a full 20 minutes over the advertised running time) and there wasn’t always quite the coherence between them, in the sense of building up into a dramatic whole that is bigger than its constituent parts. Lizzie Clachan’s design doesn’t always help here either, the intimacy of so much of what is happening is lost in the cavernous open space of the Lyttelton and no amount of stage trickery, however impressive, can mask that."
1076,1076,Ought To Be Clowns,14/06/2015,mag9l,Oresteia, Almeida,"I saw Robert Icke’s extraordinary new version of Oresteia on the same day that I watched episode 9 of series 5 of Game of Thrones [here be spoilers] and gods alive, that was a brutal day of dead children. It was also a day of some sensational acting – Stephen Dillane and Tara Fitzgerald both doing excellent work in the North, and Angus Wright and Lia Williams in blistering form in North London in the first show of the Almeida’s Greeks season which on this evidence, looks set to be a thrilling highlight of the year. Described as an adaptation by Icke of Aeschylus’ trilogy of plays detailing the fall of the House of Atreus, the reality feels more all-encompassing, a transfiguration of the drama(s) into something genuinely new that really examines the nature of Greek tragedies in light of contemporary theatre. Appropriately, Ivo van Hove was in the audience having spoken on a panel discussion earlier in the day, and it was clear to see that Icke is in part paying homage to the Belgian with influences both specific and more general clear to see in the direction here. 
The moments of characters’ death are time-stamped as in The Roman Tragedies, a howling wind gusts as strongly as it did in Antigone, the ominous rumbles of Tom Gibbons’ sound design echoing so many Toneelgroep Amsterdam productions. There may well have been wider references too but the point seems that they come from a place of respect and are elevated by their inclusion here, like music samples being layered to create a new, if slightly, familiar tune. And what new music this is, shattering and reinvigorating at the same time.  We get a dramatisation of the sacrifice of Iphigenia and crucially, a real sense of the family dynamic that existed before Agamemnon gave up his daughter’s life to the gods in order to win the Trojan War. Angus Wright is agonisingly raw as a father who cares so much for his daughter but cannot see past what he considers his higher duty. And Klytemnestra’s ferocious rage is thus given real context – it’s easy to lose sight of the fact it is her husband knowingly killing their child that Electra and Orestes later object to – and in Lia Williams’ hands, there’s no doubting the driving force behind her fury, so powerfully portrayed here in all its blood-curdling tragedy.  And because Icke has conceived this as a family drama, we keep coming back to the dinner table, to the rituals that bind people together, even as the world is falling apart. Jessica Brown Findlay makes a stunning theatrical debut as Electra, humanising her loss as a girl just longing for her father, and Luke Thompson’s Orestes is wonderfully anguished as he continually tries and fails to process his place in this cycle of violence. He’s aided by a questioning figure, a thoughtful Lorna Brown, whose role becomes clear in a final act which has a fiercely thoughtful energy to it, rooted in the very establishment of a system of justice for the first time. "
1077,1077,Ought To Be Clowns,07/04/2016,mag9l,Long Day’s Journey Into Night, Bristol Old Vic,"There’s a lot of activity planned around the celebration of Bristol Old Vic’s 250th Anniversary but it is hard to imagine it being bettered than this stunning production of Long Day’s Journey Into Night. Eugene O’Neill’s emotionally gruelling autobiographical masterpiece of a play sees director Richard Eyre reunited with Lesley Manville whose last collaboration was the superlative Ghosts which was reason enough to visit Bristol, even before the small matter of Jeremy Irons being cast against her. And so it turned out that, along with Rob Howell’s exceptional set design, is was Manville with the magic here. She plays Mary Tyrone, the matriarch of a family blighted both by the curse of addiction and an inability to talk about anything important. Her demon is morphine, her older son’s is alcohol and her younger son is seriously ill with tuberculosis but such is the rod of iron with which father James rules the roost, that these uncomfortable truths are rarely, if at all, confronted. It is a deeply moving play and in such assured hands as it is here, it is a most affecting production. Aching with deep-seated disappointments that come from as much love as rage, their confrontations ultimately as affectionate as angry, their inability to prevent the past from shaping their present becomes a fateful crutch over the passage of a long summer’s day. Irons makes James a cantankerous patriarchal figure raging against the very stasis he imposes on his household and Manville’s glorious Mary responds by sinking into the deepest denial, her final ‘triumph’ of revealing her secret one of the most heartbreaking things you will ever see."
1078,1078,Ought To Be Clowns,27/02/2011,Ian,Drowning on Dry Land, Jermyn Street,"Drowning on Dry Land is the third Alan Ayckbourn currently playing in London (Season’s Greetings and Snake in the Grass being the other two) just opening at the Jermyn Street Theatre. Written in 2004, it is a look at the curious nature of Z-list celebrity, of people who are famous just for being famous, following professional celebrity Charlie Conrad, universally adored as a grand underachiever, whose security is revealed to be paper-thin as his wife is terminally unsatisfied, his jaded agent is looking for a way out and as it turns out, he is all too aware of the precariousness of his position. Things come to a head at the birthday party of one of his children in the grounds of their country mansion when he is caught in the most compromising of positions with one of his adoring fans who has her own agenda. Part of the problem that I had with this show was ironically acknowledged in the show itself – one of the characters even says “six years is a long time in showbusiness” – and the way in which celebrity coverage through various forms of media has saturated the market means that there’s countless ‘real-life’ dramas in our day-to-day lives, should we wish to engage with them. Ayckbourn’s subject matter for this play has been overtaken by reality and resultantly presents little that is acutely observed or revelatory to us here, especially as we are all complicit in the understanding that so much of what is considered ‘celebrity’ these days is purely vacuous and talent-free.  The way in which the central Charlie is presented to us is also problematic. Ayckbourn keeps him a quite enigmatic character: sometimes gormless but essentially kind-hearted and a victim of circumstance beyond his control, he is also sometimes much more of a calculating player, fully aware of and able to work the game. Christopher Coghill plays the dim-witted side well but rarely convinced at the latter and thus there’s a strange unevenness to the play as so much of it is about how the others interact with him and by and large they all did well. Emma Swain did well at demonstrating the conflicts of a talented woman struggling with her too-tightly-defined role as society wife and mother, Siobhan Hewlett’s manic and manipulative media type was brightly done, Les Dennis’ agent had a calm placidity and I rather liked Helen Mortimer as Marsha, the tongue-tied children’s entertainer whose own manipulations after the fatal fumble causes Charlie’s downfall but simultaneously launches her own media career. The unevenness was exacerbated by the way that the opening to the second act feels shoe-horned in: it is essentially a court-room cross-examination scene but set in the same garden where the events of the first half took place, an unlikely contrivance but allows for the single set to kept in place for the show. It is brilliantly driven by Mark Farrelly’s oily manipulative big-shot lawyer Hugo, expertly needling the defendant, and a quieter but still effective turn from Russell Bentley as Simeon, her own rather dim lawyer and a schoolboy chum of Hugo’s. The real star for me though is Georgia Lowe’s set design which is strikingly effective, transforming the limited space into an ivy-covered private garden complete with Victorian folly tower which looks tremendous (and I bet it didn’t break the bank either) although as a metaphor for celebrity, the staircase leads you back to where you began rather than taking you to the top, it felt a little overwrought. So mostly entertaining, thanks to some great performances which manage to overcome some of the clunkiness of the writing and construction, but ultimately a curious choice of revival given its nature. Running time: 2 hours 20 minutes (with interval)
 Programme cost: £2
 Booking until 19th March Fair critics review! but very entertaining.Plot might be dated but still relevant to lots out there.Very believable cast,Hugo could have a position in our Law practice anytime,loved the Clown.Les Dennis played himself and provided a good anchor……..Well worth a visit!

1079,1079,Ought To Be Clowns,20/12/2006,Ian,The Seafarer, National Theatre,"Aptly, the play is set on Christmas Eve in an anodyne suburb somewhere north of Dublin and focusing on the return of Sharkey, an alcoholic recently returned to live with (and look after) Richard, his suffering older brother who went blind after a drunken incident with a skip. Two of Richard’s hard-drinking buddies drop by for a game of poker, bringing with them the temptation of drinking and unhappy memories as one of them is now shacked up with Sharkey’s wife. They also bring the mysterious Mr Lockhart with them whose presence poses an altogether different challenge. McPherson’s writing is sheer genius here, deceptively simple and comedic but overlaid with an acuity to cuts right to the heart of the middle-aged Irish man and what makes him tick. Which is namely the booze, as we come to discover the bitterness and frustration of all these men as anecdote after anecdote layers these characters up with beautiful precision. But on top of that is the relationship of Sharkey and Lockhart, the latter of whom turns out to be the devil in something of a twist which still feels more of a natural progression than anything. And in this battle, Karl Johnson’s down-trodden Sharkey plays beautifully against Ron Cook’s enigmatic Mephistophelian figure, both impressing as the stakes of the game of poker turn out to be Sharkey’s very soul. I really enjoyed Conleth Hill’s performance as one of the friends too, no-one in the cast really disappointed in the end."
1080,1080,Ought To Be Clowns,20/03/2018,Ian,The Secret Garden, The Barn Theatre Cirencester,"After three years renovation and development work, the Barn Theatre in Cirencester opens its doors with a fresh and spirited actor-musician take on The Secret Garden. A passion project of artistic director Iwan Lewis (who once appeared in a youth production of the musical in the town), the 1991 Tony-winning musical adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s 1911 children’s novel (book and lyrics by Marsha Noman, music by Lucy Simon) has been curiously under-served in terms of major revivals (I saw a fringe version back in 2013) and so proves a canny choice for a new venue seeking to attract an audience.  It is clear to see that time and thought, and resources, has been invested into the Barn to make it to help it succeed. So Sam Rowcliffe-Tanner’s lighting design, with all its delightful hidden surprises, benefits from a properly swanky lighting rig that would be the envy of pretty much any off-West-End theatre; so too PJ McEvoy’s projections looking highly professional as they move us around Misselthwaite, from dusty, disused ballrooms to briar-filled nooks. But for all the technical strength, this Secret Garden blooms because of the creative work that has been ploughed into it. The physical aspects of McEvoy’s design have a deliberately rustic feel, suiting time and place well, reflected in the nature of Elliot Ditton’s puppets. The evocation of an inquisitive robin is gorgeously done but it is the way in which Simon’s score has been thoroughly reinvented that reinforces how this production, and the venture at large, is about about mimicking the Great White Way than creating a new Cotswolds Way.  Musical supervisor John Quirk has overseen a thorough reinvigoration of the music which sees it sit squarely in the contemporary folk scene with ukeleles, violins, clarinets, acoustic guitars and more being wielded by the cast as they sing and dance their way to the heart of the story. Sue Appleby’s onstage musical direction keeps things lively and in a talented ensemble, Alex James Ellison’s puckish Dickon stands out as one to watch, And if the musical credentials here were at all in doubt, spend a little time in the auditorium during the interval to see them jam through a whole raft of audience requests. Naturally, it helps that the source material is so strong. Hodgson Burnett’s deserved classic of a novel remains remarkable in the way that it deals uncompromisingly with death and disease. And director Dominic Shaw doesn’t shy away from any of the pain of raw grief – David Haydn’s starched Archibald is near-paralysed by the loss of his wife, Daniella Piper lashes out wildly as a precocious Mary uprooted from all she knows with the loss of her family and her Indian home, Celeste de Veazey’s bed-bound Colin is no less vicious as his twin terrors of abandonment and illness hold him prisoner.  But guided by ghosts of the past (imaginatively staged as puppet shows, and led by the piercing beauty of Jaimie Pruden’s voice as Lilly) and the awakening of Mary’s huge generosity of spirit (a highly charismatic turn from Piper), the household painstakingly transforms into a place where a family might flourish once again. Shaw has a clear eye for visually stunning tableaux and as a result, the show is full of gorgeous images that sear themselves onto the mind – the way Colin’s health comes back, a cellist in the spotlight, the discovery of the garden…"
1081,1081,Ought To Be Clowns,21/10/2015,mag9l,A Streetcar Named Desire, Curve Studio,"I’ve only been to the Studio at Leicester’s Curve Theatre a couple of times but I’ve never seen it done up this much like a proper theatre with a balcony and all but such it is for Nikolai Foster’s production of A Streetcar Named Desire, his first at the venue where he is now Artistic Director. Tennessee Williams’ classic receives a rather traditional, if youthfully inclined, interpretation here which thus can’t help but pale a little in comparison to Benedict Andrews’ extraordinary reimagining for the Young Vic last year. The challenges of the space are clear though in the sometimes challenging acoustics of the studio which, combined with an unstinting commitment to heavy accents, poses audibility issues throughout the production. Which is a shame as it really does look good – Michael Taylor’s set design perfectly evokes the faded grandeur and stifling intimacy of the French Quarter and Guy Hoare’s lighting suggests all of its carnivalesque atmosphere with its twinkling fairy lights and sultry red hues. And where youth is on its side is in showing the intensity of Stella and Stanley’s relationship, emphasising the generational shift that their marriage, represents. The gleaming bright eyes and chiseled musculature of Stewart Clarke’s Stanley is full of swaggering possibility and teamed with Dakota Blue Richards’ poised Stella, resplendent in a nifty pair of slacks and pragmatically forward-thinking, together they infuse sense and sensuality into Williams’ world. Charlie Brooks has a more difficult job in the iconic role of Blanche DuBois, her flighty portrayal engaging but not quite digging deep enough and so the cracks, when they come, aren’t quite as affecting as they could be (memories of Gillian Anderson are still strong but so too Rachel Weisz and Amanda Drew). Patrick Knowles’ buffoonish Mitch is inspired though, his relative youth positioning him more part of Stanley and Stella’s world despite his obvious affection for Blanche and there’s great work too from Sandy Foster’s rational neighbour Eunice. "
1082,1082,Ought To Be Clowns,05/09/2014,Ian,Medea, National Theatre,
1083,1083,Ought To Be Clowns,18/07/2010,Ian,Bent, Tabard," Andrew Keates’ production of Martin Sherman’s play Bent was a big success at the Landor Theatre earlier in the year and so its transfer to the Tabard Theatre in Chiswick makes sense. Both spaces share an intimacy that feels appropriate to the intense emotion of the play and Keates is clearly attuned to the full range of human experience that lovers Max and Rudy are forced to go through. In 1930s Berlin, the pair flee persecution after witnessing a murder but when the Nazis catch up with them, they’re shipped off to Dachau. What follows is an exploration of just how viciously homosexuals were treated by the Nazi regime and a testament to the immense spirit shown by those who were unfortunate enough to be oppressed. This lends the Dachau scenes an air of slight unreality, almost of idealism, but it is one that is indubitably well-earned as these men search for the tiniest bit of tenderness, humanity, even love, in the most horrendous of surroundings. The brutality of Freya Groves’ design of barbed wire and swastikas never lets us forget where we are though."
1084,1084,Ought To Be Clowns,25/10/2012,Ian,Dangerous Lady, Theatre Royal Stratford East,"I’m a big fan of crime fiction but somehow Martina Cole has passed me by: none of my book-sharing buddies ever press her work into my hands, the TV adaptations didn’t grab me and the previous two Cole stage adaptations failed to tempt me to Theatre Royal Stratford East. But TRSE are clearly happy with how they went and it seems to be turning into an annual event there, so this year one can take in a version of her first novel, Dangerous Lady. Cole seems to occupy similar ground, if not subject matter, to the Jilly Coopers and Jackie Collins of the world, the story has an epic sweep over several decades but an intimate focus in the struggles and self-empowerment of a ballsy lady. Here it is Maura Ryan, born into a family of gangsters but determined to do the right thing by avoiding the family business. An ill-advised liaison with a cop ends up in pregnancy but he swiftly departs and the subsequent back alley abortion leaves her broken-hearted, infertile and hardened to the world. She then joins her brothers and together they come to conquer gangland, but at considerable sacrifice. Patrick Prior has adapted the story for the stage, as he did with the previous two, with a great deal of condensing of plot and conflation of characters, but there’s still a hell of a lot to get through and so the narrative rips along. Or rather, it would if it could.  The production is largely crippled by the sluggishness that comes from the design. Jean-Marc Puissant’s set uses a double revolve which moves at an inexplicably slow pace as we wind from scene to scene but director Lisa Goldman does little to cover this, indeed her actors frequently just dash off-stage. Consequently, this makes the transitions rather laborious as time and time again, we watch props move slowly round an empty stage, where a bit more directorial flair might have used these opportunities in a more inventive manner.  Matters aren’t helped by a performance style which repeatedly tends to the overstated and overwrought. Cole’s story and Prior’s adaptation whips through the decades so quickly that there’s little time for any real characterisation to come through with the supporting players who often appear for the briefest of moments, so the broadest of brushes are applied to ensure we’re left in no doubt as to whether this is a “GAY!” or “FOREIGN!” character, or else emotions are broadcast with a clumsy hamminess – “NOOOOOOOOOOOO!” (the response to finding a head in a box). At the centre of the play though, there is interesting work which goes some way to redeeming the production. Claire-Louise Cordwell invests Maura with a core of inner steel, which means her shift from good girl to hardened gangster isn’t quite as far-fetched as one might imagine. James Clyde’s gay head of the family, her brother Michael, combines fraternal charm with his implacable professional demeanour to icy effect and Veronica Quilligan spits and snarls with the roughest humour as their embittered mother, who of course is not above taking back-handers whilst despairing of her children’s activities. But as with so many of these authors, we’re expected to root for the central character, empathise with her plight in ploughing her own way through a patriarchal society, and to do so here is to endorse violence, murder, arson, robbery, all in the name of making money. There’s not even a decent love story as Paul Woodson’s cop, who was apparently the love of Maura’s life, reappears for too brief a time for them to work on their barely-there chemistry, and the note of redemption on which the story ends leaves quite a sour taste.  Perhaps I’d feel differently if I was more familiar with Cole’s writing, but I doubt it. In a post-Gomorrah world, the glamorisation of gang life just feels dated and wrong-headed, no matter how well performed by Cordwell. Still think you're being far too kind. This was an embarrassing mess from start to finish, Woodson's over-emoting was particularly cringe-worthy, and I've never heard so many people laughing so much and so loudly at a performance for ALL the wrong reasons."
1085,1085,Ought To Be Clowns,28/02/2016,mag9l,Beyond the Fence, Arts,"For all the hoopla surrounding the genesis of Beyond the Fence – “a musical conceived by computer and substantially crafted by computer” – one does have to wonder would any of us have noticed had we not been informed in advance. The show is the product of a wide-ranging experiment to use artificial intelligence (including a computer system called Android Lloyd Webber) to crunch actual intelligence (about well over 1,000 musicals) to come up with the ideal book, music and lyrics for a machine-tooled West End hit. Naturally, it isn’t quite as simple as that as the extensive credits (included below for your convenience) demonstrate, the results of all this considerable data analysis actually being shaped or curated into fully fledged musical theatre form by human hands, specifically those of Benjamin Till and Nathan Taylor (they who made their nuptials into Our Gay Wedding: The Musical). Thus Beyond the Fence was born, the response to the statistically-most-likely-to-come-up-with-a-winner scenario “what if a wounded soldier had to learn how to understand a child in order to find true love?” So we find ourselves at the Greenham Common peace camp, among the assorted women of Green Gate – the political campaigner, the mouthy lesbians, the fat northern one, the bookish Asian, the kindly empty-nester, the sexually liberated hippy and the mother fleeing a violent relationship with her daughter who was rendered mute by witnessing the incident. And because the computer says so, we also get US army captain Jim whose sensitive soul and slightly gammy knee makes him apparently irresistible, even to the hardest-held of feminist credentials. Beyond the Fence really isn’t that bad at all but crucially, it really isn’t that inspired either. Despite the intriguing possibilities of the set-up, the default position of the data analysis is always predictably straight down the middle and so nothing makes the pulse quicken, nothing fully engages our emotions. Director Luke Sheppard has cast his show astutely though and where they can, the company elevate the material into places that no algorithm can account for – the wry humour of Laura Jane Matthewman’s Helen a delight to see, Rebecca Brewer’s intelligent warmth as Kim frustrated by conflicting agendas, CJ Johnson’s Mary a forceful presence even as the plot twists her character too far by the end. Likewise, Candida Caldicot’s musical direction has a job to break out of the middle of the road where the vast majority of the songs end up but occasionally, as in the graceful harmonies of full company number ‘We Are Greenham’ or the powerful control of Llio Millward’s riffs, something of the real magic of musical theatre is conjured. Ultimately though, the formulaic nature of Beyond the Fence is its undoing – the rhymes that plucked from a thesaurus, the romance that has to be shoehorned in despite no real dramatic evidence for it, the pick’n’mix approach to character which really never dares to delve beneath the surface.   Is computer-generated musical theatre the way of the future? On this evidence, not so much as it doesn’t achieve anything here that couldn’t have been done by humans alone, and done better too. But it is an interesting development in the intersection between theatre and technology that I suspect we haven’t heard the last of. To follow more about the show, you can watch the TV series Computer Says Show on Sky Arts which will culminate in a broadcast of Beyond the Fence. Archie Baron"
1086,1086,Ought To Be Clowns,25/10/2015,mag9l,Hey, Old Friends,"Theatreland does like to make sure every anniversary gets marked somehow and so following on from the celebrations around Les Misérables’ 30th birthday earlier this month is a similar hoohah for Stephen Sondheim’s 85th year on this planet. As is de rigueur for these events, a gala concert has been put on for the occasion with the kind of rollcall you could only normally dream of and naturally, Hey, Old Friends! had the price tag to go along with it. As with Les Mis (which donated to Save The Children’s Syria Children’s appeal), the show benefitted charitable purposes, specifically The Stephen Sondheim Society and telephone helpline service The Silver Line, harnessing the major fundraising potential of such events. That said, these tickets tend to be so expensive that there’s a nagging feeling that they’re serving a limited audience with few opportunities for regular theatregoers to be a part of them. Then there’s also the fact that it’s hard to make these events truly special when they happen fairly regularly. I mean it’s a nice problem to have but it is getting harder to get excited about similar ground being retrod every few years or so, even when it is celebrating such musical theatre talent as Sondheim himself – ‘Being Alive’ is undoubtedly a very good song and Michael Xavier did a fantastic job here but on the larger scale, it just feels like it’s been done before, many times.  A birthday tribute is the wrong time to complain about retrospectives but I’d love to see a company of this calibre tackling new musical theatre writing and shining a much-needed spotlight on composers who might yet achieve a modicum of the success that Sondheim’s career has accrued. Which all makes me sound rather grumpy I know, and ungrateful for having been lucky enough to attend, but I’m just being honest.  And when all is said and done, there was lots to enjoy and appreciate, not least Rosie Ashe’s powerful ‘Last Midnight’, Daniel Evans and Anna Francolini’s soaring ‘Move On’ leading into ‘Sunday’, Bonnie Langford’s every acrobatic movement and the final sequence which saw Tracie Bennett, Haydn Gwynne, Charlotte Page and Kim Criswell take on the oddly named “11 O’Clock Numbers” (ie the most famous ones) – ‘Broadway Baby’, ‘Send In The Clowns’, ‘Losing My Mind’ and ‘I’m Still Here’ respectively. "
1087,1087,Ought To Be Clowns,04/11/2013,Ian,Unscorched, Finborough,"The Papatango New Writing Prize is now in its fifth year and continues its excellent working relationship with the Finborough Theatre in offering a month’s full run to the winning play. And following on from such interesting works as Dawn King’s Foxfinder and Louise Monaghan’s Pack, Luke Owen’s Unscorched feels a worthy winner, an intriguing debut play which navigates its intensely serious subject matter with a supremely deft touch. That subject is child abuse, but specifically how it impacts those whose job it is to investigate the images and films that are flagged up as crimes against children. Owen’s play follows Tom as he starts a new job in such a digital analysis team and explores how the pervasive effects of what he has to watch permeate into every aspect of his life. Echoes of what he sees and hears taint his sense of normality, the challenge to his faith in human nature threatening his burgeoning relationship with the sweet Emily.  There’s fascinating insight into the way in which a convivial office environment is cultivated to help the workers decompress – daytime TV, video games and Simply Red CDs on tap for comfort breaks – and a subtly clever examination of the way in which we all find our own ways of avoiding discomfort in an increasingly graphic world. But what is most impressive in Owen’s writing is the way in which he suggests the world of horrors on the screens without resorting to shock tactics – the mere mention of ‘category five’ chilling the soul more than sufficiently. Justin Audibert’s production is blessed with some stellar performances – Ronan Raftery is excellent as the increasingly disturbed Tom; John Hodgkinson superb as his senior colleague Nidge who loves nothing more than a celebratory Wagon Wheel but whose cheery bonhomie scarcely hides the corrosive long-term effects of the job; and Eleanor Wyld as the girlish Emily brings a lovely quirky warmth to their speed-dating and later scenes of abortive courtship."
1088,1088,Ought To Be Clowns,11/11/2011,Ian,Henry V, Propeller at Yvonne Arnaud,"After the phenomenal success of their pairing of Richard III and The Comedy of Errors which toured considerably this year, all-male Shakespeare company Propeller are riding on something of a high. The company has evolved once again with some departures, some new faces and several stalwarts remaining in situ to take on Henry V (which will be accompanied by The Winter’s Tale from next year) which will tour the UK and the world once again, even heading over to Australia and New Zealand in March. A history play that has war at the very heart of it, Henry V perhaps lends itself more easily than most to updating, the enduring nature of conflict meaning that resonance is sadly never too far away. Propeller, with Michael Pavelka’s design, have adopted a modern feel – costumes point towards early-twentieth century – but one that generally feels more timeless rather than particularly anchored to any specific period with scaffolding units and crates forming a flexible set. The company bring their customary level of reinvigoration to the play, breathing a new physical life into the work and letting their imagination take it to new places. That said, there’s a sense of disparate elements being brought together here that haven’t quite necessarily melded into an organic whole yet, this is the premiere of the production after all. This is particularly evident in the highly eclectic mixture of songs which is threaded throughout the production, although mainly in the first half. From the gorgeous arrangement of ‘Te Deum’, written by company member Nicholas Asbury, to raucous renditions of the Pogues and the Clash; the comedy of ‘Chanson D’Amour’ to the solemnity of ‘Requiem’, another in-house composition this time from Gunnar Cauthery. We are effectively transported from location to location, vaulted cathedrals to testosterone-filled war camps but it also lends a slightly schizophrenic feel, perhaps suitable for this production but lacking a sense of thematic unity. Elsewhere, there are flickers of inventiveness that don’t feel quite fully realised, the stagecraft too clunkily evident. The way in which the fights are done and the gore portrayed came across as a bit fussy and not altogether necessary and especially so, compared to the powerful imagery that Ed Hall creates when relying on simplicity – torchlight is used devastatingly well at one point and using crates as shields provides another arresting visual. And it is the company that is always the main strength of the production: splitting the lines of the Chorus between them is a masterstroke, hooking the audience into the storytelling beautifully, and there’s a cohesive physicality on display – the preparatory military combat training has paid dividends there. As the titular Henry, Dugald Bruce-Lockhart makes an intriguing leading man. Presumably through design, to remind of human vulnerability, his delivery is pitched rather oddly, too often using a voice with little heft to it that proved to be rather disarming. It might make him a more human character, reminding us of the man beneath the crown, but it also robs him of much of the charisma necessary to become the inspirational leader he needs to be, especially when there’s so much powerful verse-speaking going on around him. Looking back, it does actually emerge as a layered portrayal of a complex character, but in the moment, it felt a little as if something isn’t quite there yet. Everyone else doubles, if not triples up, to great effect: Vince Leigh’s England football-shirt-wearing Pistol is excellent as is Robert Hands, Chris Myles’ stern-faced Alice, guarding the Princess’ honour hilariously, is a hoot and Gunnar Cauthery makes a strong impact as both an Archbishop and a highly physical Dauphin, forever doing press-ups and sit-ups. But Tony Bell and Karl Davies emerged as the most effective actors for me and in both the roles they inhabited. Bell makes a delightfully coarse but all too brief Mistress Quickly, finding some real emotion even in the midst of such bawdiness, and makes a superb Fluellen. And Propeller newcomer Karl Davies handles the comic business of Princess Katherine’s English lesson like an absolute pro, getting the second half off to a cracking start, but he also finds a touching inner strength and ultimately heart-breaking depth to his scared young soldier."
1089,1089,Ought To Be Clowns,07/02/2015,Ian,The Real Thing, American Airlines Theatre,"Arcadia aside, it does appear I have my Stoppard issues but in the running theme of my Broadway booking, (relative) star casting trumped common sense. In this case, it was Maggie Gyllenhaal and Cynthia Nixon that tempted me (plus Ewan McGregor and Ronan Raftery) along to this most lauded of his plays. And whilst I was glad of the opportunity to see this company, and be suitably impressed by both Gyllenhaal and Nixon, I couldn’t help but feel that I just don’t get the thing about The Real Thing. >Seeing it for the second time, the sucker punch of the metatheatrics is necessarily lessened. Knowing the layers of the Russian dolls are just that didn’t really bring anything new for me in my feeling for the play (or the play-within-the-play, or etc etc) and I think Sam Gold’s production is mostly responsible for that with a whole lot of theatrical fussiness that adds bulk but not genuine substance – musical interludes drag, David Zimm’s set distracts with its open blandness, so much of it just feels flat.  Which in turn throw focus on the writing and for all the trumpeting of Stoppard’s astuteness about matters of love and betrayal and art and life, it’s not immediately apparent to me that he’s saying very much that is particularly insightful. Play-acting is play-acting and real life is better – it ain’t rocket science but there’s a whole lot of energy being expended here to say not a whole deal more than that as far as I can see."
1090,1090,Ought To Be Clowns,13/05/2008,Ian,Rosmersholm, Almeida,"Rosmer, a former pastor, is oppressed by a whole series of factors: his conservative ancestry, guilt over his wife’s suicide and loss of religious faith. But, aided by his companion, Rebecca West, he believes he can set out on a new path of missionary idealism. This, however, turns out to be a fantasy as he is not strong in his new path, society turns against him and his new democratic ideals, his closeness to West makes them become a subject of scandal, and as Rebecca has her own demons too, sets them on a path where the weight of the past threatens everything.  Helen McCrory is pleasingly brilliant as Rebecca West. Dressed in a blonde wig, I’m not sure if this is a hangover from her recent filming of Harry Potter as Narcissa Malfoy or an attempt to make her look more Norwegian (if so, it doesn’t work). Fortunately McCrory’s acting is so wonderfully subtle and restrained that it is easy to ignore her hair(!), it is her passion and desire that drives so much of what happens but it is all presented in such an understated manner, it is hard not to be crushed by the way in which her dreams are destroyed. Malcolm Sinclair is convincingly sinister as the outraged conservative schoolmaster, artfully indiscreet in pursuing the downfall of West and Paul Hilton is also good as the directionless pastor Rosmer, nervously unsure of himself and his newfound course of action. It looks absolutely beautiful. Hildegard Bechtler’s design and Peter Mumford’s lighting combine to starkly suggest a Munch-like painting. And the contrasting of the light and dark is so effectively done, especially when played against the darkening of the moods of the protagonists."
1091,1091,Ought To Be Clowns,07/10/2011,Ian,Sweeney Todd, Chichester Festival Theatre,"Imelda Staunton is ideal casting for Mrs Lovett: younger readers will certainly recognise her as Dolores Umbridge but may not be aware of her outstanding musical theatre credentials which formed a major part of her earlier career, including an Olivier award winning turn as the Baker’s Wife in Into the Woods, also by Sondheim. The comic business of the first half with her discovery of the first body and the later ‘A Little Priest’ is as good as you would dare hope it could be, but where she really excels is in the second half as she delves into the darker side of this woman. The desperation exposed by Todd’s lack of enthusiasm for her seaside dream cuts deep but then as her young charge edges ever closer to the truth of what is going on, the ugly truth rears its head with a frankly terrifying rendition of ‘Not While I’m Around’ – don’t make eye contact with her at the end of the song, it will scar you for life! And Michael Ball as the titular Demon Barber is also terrifically good, he’s undergone quite the makeover and is virtually unrecognisable, looking more like a brownshirt than anything. He captures the laconic cruelty and the glowering menace of a man shorn of his moral framework and his rich voice swoops around Sondheim’s score with consummate ease. With such strong leads performing so superbly, the supporting cast have to try their hardest to prevent being overshadowed. In some cases there’s no problem at all as in James McConville’s determined young Tobias – superb when duetting with Staunton – and Luke Brady’s Anthony who invests his oft-repeated Johanna with passionate yearning. I felt Lucy May Barker needed crisper diction, her speech and singing both sweet but neither ringing with the requisite clarity or demonstrating much character, likewise John Bowe’s Judge Turpin didn’t make quite enough impact for such a pivotal role. The sizeable ensemble feels a little extravagant given how little they have to do – making them put creepy clowns masks on for a flashback seemed a little unnecessary – but they do sound glorious, especially when Nicholas Skilbeck’s 15-strong orchestra is in full flow and it was particularly nice to see the fabulous Anton Stephans in there too. Anthony Ward’s design is excellently put together with much kinetic energy: the central box atop which Todd carries out his dirty business allows for his barber’s chair to deposit his victims down a chute and is constantly revolving; Mrs Lovett’s kitchen and living room are compact but beautifully mounted and there’s some effective use of lifts, people sinking out of sight on a regular basis. But the star of the show is Mark Henderson’s lighting design, or rather his shadow design, as the whole production is suffused with a darkness, the gloom only occasionally pierced by shafts of light and the resulting shadows that play all around are highly atmospheric. The only minor point would be that it does feel like a set designed for a proscenium arch theatre – perhaps a nod to the likely London transfer – much of the action is played out to the front, the garret atop the stage curves round quite tightly and so though one wouldn’t miss too much, I’d advise against booking on the far sides."
1092,1092,Ought To Be Clowns,09/11/2015,mag9l,A Wolf in Snakeskin Shoes, Tricycle,"Marcus Gardley’s The House That Will Not Stand was something of a triumph for the Tricycle last year so it is little surprise that Indhu Rubasingham has returned to the playwright for a new production there, A Wolf in Snakeskin Shoes. An adaptation of Molière’s Tartuffe, it shifts the action from seventeenth century Paris to modern-day Atlanta and the world of mega-churches but maintains the air of hypocrisy around its lead character, here renamed Tardimus Toof. Toof’s church is in a parlous financial position and having long sold himself as having healing powers, turns to fried chicken tycoon Archibald Organdy to lay his hands and fleece his pockets. His lascivious eye, which has wandered over many a female parishioner as he “undresses sin”, turns to Organdy’s mistress Peaches – a never-better Adjoa Andoh – even with Sharon D Clarke’s imperious wife a considerable presence both in church and at home. Conscious of Molière’s style, Gardley splices his narrative with verse monologues and gospel interludes and Rubasingham invests these with considerable energy and real panache. This does lead to a certain unevenness with the scenes inbetween which sometimes fall a little flat, the move to a broader and broader sense of farce testing the boundaries of my sense of humour a little too much. But then I’ve never much loved farce even despite the name of the blog."
1093,1093,Ought To Be Clowns,29/01/2016,mag9l,PLAY, VAULT Festival," PLAY is a new writing initiative that aims to inspire collaborative working by bringing together writers and directors and giving them two weeks to come up with a short play. And here at the VAULT Festival, there’s two sets of four plays, or PLAYs, bringing together a rather exciting set of creatives to produce some spankingly fresh theatre. The second set takes place mid-February but I’d urge you to book for this one now (you’ve got until Sunday) as I reckon it’s the best tenner you can spend this week, with some seriously impressive work going on here. Play 9, written by Chloe Todd Fordham and directed by Polina Kalinina, felt like a bit of a riff on Shallow Grave, three university pals skirting around an uncomfortable truth about their (unseen) flatmate. Starting off with a well-choreographed sequence of fighting over a remote, Fordham’s writing quickly slipped into its structure of three differing accounts of what happened, slightly complementary, slightly contradictory, full of detail fleshing out the complex relationships herein, slowly but surely moving the place of real revelation. A couple of right-up-to-the-minute references perhaps overplayed their hand but I did mostly enjoy the shifty evasion of this guilty trio.  Play 10, written Sam H Freeman and directed by Dan Pick, was one of my favourites in its sheer unexpectedness and audacity. A pair of women trapped in a toxic, possibly emotionally abusive, relationship go back and forth with hilarious and humanistic results, Pick pulling an astonishing intensity from both Molly Vevers and Thalissa Teixeira that brought an exciting uncertainty about what might happen next. The running gag about a lactose-intolerant person working in a cheese shop was also excellently worked. Play 11, written by Afsaneh Gray and directed by Oliver Dawe, had a beguiling quality as three 27-year-olds met up for a drink, each tiptoeing around a slightly disillusioned portrait of young adulthood, their interior frustrations spilling forth in asides to the audience. Gray’s writing taps into very real fears about today’s job market, loneliness in an ever more social media-obsessed world and latterly, a darker twist into racially-defined politics and the dangers – and ease – of simply being too complacent. An engaging cautionary tale well acted by Anyebe Godwin, Lowri Palfrey and Rosie Sansom. Play 12, written by David Mumeni and directed by Kirsty Patrick Ward, was another two-hander and another extraordinary success. Lewis MacKinnon (“a Scottish Owen Jones” and Assad Zaman (“the Asian persuasion”) play two young men negotiating their way through the minefield of modern masculinity in the dating world, their monologues spliced together in their separate but linked journeys. Touching on what it really means to be a feminist, how to deal with societal expectations of being a ‘real’ man and its sexual politics too, this was a deeply considered piece of writing, intelligent but scorchingly funny with it, a job very well done."
1094,1094,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2019,Ian,Macbeth, Watermill,"Circumstances prevailed against me getting to see the Watermill’s Macbeth before its final day so I’m cheating by just firing up a mini-review. Truth be told, I only really booked for Paul Hart’s production on the strength of his track record in re-imagining Shakespeare so successfully – I had no real desire to see this particular play again, so soon after two major disappointments at the National and the RSC."
1095,1095,Ought To Be Clowns,21/01/2010,Ian,Three Sisters, Lyric Hammersmith,"According to the programme, Christopher Hampton’s version of Three Sisters at the Lyric Hammersmith directed by Sean Holmes and the Filter theatre company, is here to raise “the audience’s otherwise sluggard pulses in a revivifying revival”: what more introduction could we possibly need?! Three Sisters opens with Irina Prozorova’s name-day celebration, in the provincial Russian town where their late military father had been stationed. Irina and her sisters Olga and Masha make half-hearted attempts to put up with life in their adopted home, but cannot stop longing for their birth town Moscow. We then follow the sisters and a group of acquaintances over a 3 year period as the sisters learn the hard lessons of life. Filter are known for their use of sound and in parts of the first half, this approach was quite effective. I loved the use of microphones dotted around the stage to allow us to eavesdrop on whispered conversations in dark corners and permitted full use of the stripped-back stage. I was less sure about the use of an amplified boiling kettle to represent a passing storm, and quite why a violin case had to be used to pop a balloon to imitate a gunshot (and unsuccessfully I might ungentlemanly add, the actor had to just slam the case in the end), I do not know. The second half had much less of this, an imbalance which ended up giving the impression that they could have gone quite a bit further with this sonic creativity to be honest. Perhaps the best known name in the cast is Romola Garai, and she is very good as the unhappily married Masha, but Poppy Miller as Olga and Clare Dunne as Irina match her nicely and they form a strong triumvirate at the centre of this play. But although they are titular, there are many other characters with as much import in this play and they were supported well by John Lightbody’s dashing and poetic Vershinin, Jonathan Broadbent’s foppish Baron and Paul Brennen’s bookish and really quite amusing Kulygin. Ferdy Roberts and Gemma Saunders also did well as the Prozorov brother and sister-in-law taking over the house and the lives of the sisters. My heart sank when I saw the running time of 3 hours as we entered the auditorium (it actually came in at a shade under) and the bare staging that evokes the NT’s recent Mother Courage, but to its credit, I never felt it drag at any point. It is engaging enough and well-acted but not one that particularly moved me or my sluggard pulse, a comment on the play more than the production I feel. Absolute rubbish, they've ripped the heart and soul out of this play. A poor attempt at ripping of Mother Courage as you say and pointlessly done. I have to agree too.  Chekhov can be one of the most powerful and moving writers, and this production, I felt, mocked him.  It has a smug, knowing air, for very little work, from some of the actors too (notably Vershinin and the Baron we felt), and we left disappointed (but stayed til the end unlike the couple to our right who didn't return after the interval on Wednesday). It was a curious one for sure. Looking back on it, I felt no emotional contact with what was happening on stage, but even so I wasn't bored.I'm still waiting for a Chekhov experience that completely blows me away though, I've not had that yet (although I did enjoy The Cherry Orchard at the Old Vic last year) It did nothing for me either, I'm afraid. And the couple next to me left in the interval too. Oh dear. I struggled on but was really quite relieved when it finished. Go and see Midsummer at the Soho Theatre instead – its ace! I disagree. It's the first time I've seen a Chekhov that makes sense. I thought it was brilliant. Very sad, and very true."
1096,1096,Ought To Be Clowns,11/09/2014,Ian,Reptember – Triple Bill B, New Diorama,"And so to complete the set of triple bills at the New Diorama, Programme B of The Faction’s Reptember saw my third trip in quick succession to this most friendly of theatres, tucked away near Warren Street station and possessing some of the loveliest people working there. My mood was further enhanced by this proving to be my favourite of the three shows, demonstrating the greatest variety of style and mood in the solo performances that have made up this rep season. Programme A was also strong and if Programme C wasn’t quite my cup of tea, any issues I felt it had were more than compensated for here. First up is Lachlan McCall in The Man With The Flower In His Mouth written by Pirandello and adapted and directed here by Faction AD Mark Leipacher. McCall is the perfect choice from the ensemble for this ruminative piece, his ruffled everyman demeanour suits the gentle rhythm of this late night interaction between his character and a man who’s missed the last train. The role of the other guy is taken by a video camera into which McCall speaks, the image being projected onto the back wall thereby co-opting us all into the reveal of the depths of his melancholy soul. It’s subtle but becomes most moving. That’s then followed by a fierce riff on Euripides’ Medea by Emily Juniper, handing associate artist Shakuntala Ramanee a gem of a reinterpreted role as we see the scorned woman in the midst of creating the fatal wedding gift that will seal the fate of so many. Juniper completely reshapes in the narrative to create something fascinatingly different, even the dress itself has a say in the matter, and Ramanee revels in the jagged spikes in temperament that make this an extraordinary piece to watch (through some nifty lighting) and to listen to (in the gorgeous timbre of Ramanee’s voice)."
1097,1097,Ought To Be Clowns,08/09/2015,mag9l,Parade, London Theatre Workshop,"Bringing a 13-strong company into such a small space is something of a challenge but a necessary one in order give the real sense of the full scope of a community at odds with each other. Tranter manages it well though with a fluid sense of pace swirling around Harry Johnson and Justin Williams’ inventive set design and ably assisted by some ingeniously conceived choreography from Adam Scown, bringing a real intricate power to the ensemble numbers. And at the heart of the group is Ross Barnes’ Leo Frank, the Brooklyn Jew now resident in Georgia who finds himself wrongfully accused of the death of a child at his factory, and Lily de-la-Haye as his long-suffering wife Lucille. The gradual reigniting of their passion in the face of an increasingly hysterical media commotion around the case is beautifully done, with both performers excavating powerful emotional depths, especially recent graduate de-la-Haye."
1098,1098,Ought To Be Clowns,27/02/2017,mag9l,Lizzie, Greenwich Theatre,"I’d be fibbing if I tried to claim that rock is my kind of music. Although even as I say that, I’ve a residual fondness for the big hair and tunes of Heart from my childhood, Skunk Anansie figured large in my teenage years, and seeing Peaches live at the Astoria is one of my all time live music highlights, so evidently I’m more partial to (female) rock than I instinctively realise.  And maybe it’s just my frame of reference but elements of all three intermittently came to mind in Lizzie, written by Steven Cheslik-DeMeyer, Alan Stevens Hewitt and Tim Maner. The storytelling of opener ‘The House of Borden’ is rooted in melodious soft rock, Eden Espinisa’s extraordinary vocal can’t help but bring to mind Skin at her fiercest and the chants of Somebody Will Do Something’ felt but a breath away from ‘Fuck the Pain Away’. So Lizzie proved to be considerably more interesting than I thought a rock musical would be, presented as something between a semi-staged musical and rock gig, it’s a striking thing indeed. That’s not to say that the score might not benefit from just a touch of tonal variety – the scintillating four part vocalisations sounded amazing but would have brought the house down if they’d been unplugged even just for a bar or two – and sonic bombast doesn’t always make for lyrical clarity.  But this way of presenting the story of Lizzie Borden, a woman tried and acquitted of the axe murder of her father and stepmother in late 19th century Massachusetts, is actually quite clever. Forgoing conventional storytelling for the purer passion of belted-out rock music connects powerfully with the intense feelings of Bjørg Gamst’s societally repressed Lizzie and the way she interacts with older sister Emma, the glorious Eden Espinosa, her friend and sometime lover (Bleu Woodward) and maid (Jodie Jacobs). It may not be entirely clear what is happening all of the time but there’s never any doubt as to what these women are feeling and in that respect, Victoria Bussert’s production possesses a real gut-wrenching power. Greg Daniels’ choreography is stronger when it moves away from posing around the mike stand as its angular poses produce striking silhouettes and interplay with microphones suggests something of the torrid relationships here. Fierce and surprisingly good fun."
1099,1099,Ought To Be Clowns,04/05/2015,mag9l,As Good A Time As Any, Print Room,"It’s often that the mind thinks to compare Peter Gill with Simon Stephens but sitting through the former’s self-directed new play As Good A Time As Any in the surroundings of the Print Room at the Coronet cinema in Notting Hill, one couldn’t help but wonder what a different director might have made of it. The playtext for Stephens’ Carmen Disruption allows for, even actively encourages, directorial innovation, offering up a world of theatrical potential (in this case, ingeniously realised by Michael Longhurst) but there’s little of that imagination spilling forth from Gill. Which is not to denigrate the quality of the writing here, which has a hypnotically compelling quality that transports its naturalism to a higher plane. The play consists of eight women sharing their everyday thoughts in all their banal humdrumness, divided into five choruses that break up the rhythm and interweaving with each other to demonstrate that no matter how different we think we are from the person across the street, the stranger sat opposite on the tube, the seatmate in a never-changing waiting room, we’re all pretty much the same, thinking pretty much the same thoughts. A simple premise it may seem but it is powerfully, profoundly, explored here, beautifully eloquent in expressing the different struggles that people in articulating the true depths of their own truths, whether the pain of the loss of a child or a loved one, troubling divorces or painful pasts – the crippling fear of loneliness underscoring so many of the revelations that finally come to light as the monologues wind their way to the point that they need to make, in order to show they’ve survived and by extension how we can survive too. "
1100,1100,Ought To Be Clowns,06/09/2016,mag9l,Ghost, New Wimbledon,"Where to begin… I was a big Girls Aloud fan back in the day and so I was definitely intrigued to see Sarah Harding onstage in this new touring version of Ghost the Musical. And being a Girls Aloud fan I’m allowed to be affectionately mocking of her as per this clip, which is far far removed from the opprobrium she has been facing since opening last week at the New Wimbledon. It’s quite a shocking level of scathing criticism that has been levelled her way and one which speaks deeply of nothing less than societal misogyny. For there is no denying that this is an embarrassingly bad production at the moment but the fact that she is shouldering the blame for it is hugely unfair. Director Bob Tomson and producer Bill Kenwright simply have to take the responsibility for putting something that just isn’t ready on the stage and asking people to pay money to see it. I’ve seen dress rehearsals that were better than this and one can just cannot imagine the irresponsibility of the decision-making that led them to go ahead instead of delaying by a week or so. Money clearly rules. There’s no escaping the fact that Harding doesn’t look or sound ready yet, her movement is awkward and her projection a little too unreliable but as evidenced by opening number ‘Here Right Now’, her co-star Andy Moss is equally unprepared – I don’t think I’ve ever heard something as embarrassingly mis-sung in a theatre as harmonies, timing, pitching all went spectacularly awry. And with the original set design reimagined by Mark Bailey (on a budget), the show’s illusion game becomes very weak and Moss is singularly unable to hide the fact he spends a lot of time wafting into thin air and emoting badly like the Hollyoaks teenager as whom he made his name.  So point the finger at Harding if you will, but you’re ignoring the real villains of the piece in Tomson and Kenwright who clearly couldn’t contemplate any change to the London date of their tour and to whom the responsibility of any complaints about celebruity casting should ultimately fall. A bit more time may well see both Harding and Moss improve, though one has to feel for Harding whose confidence will have been severely shaken (she can sing you know), and there’s a half-decent cast around them, Jacqui Dubois’ Oda Mae doing her best to enliven the scenes she’s in. But for a show I have enjoyed in the West End and also on previous tours, this is a most undignified state of affairs. Believe? More like unbelievable."
1101,1101,Ought To Be Clowns,06/06/2014,mag9l,All My Sons, Open Air Theatre,"Ivo van Hove’s revelatory approach to Arthur Miller’s work has set the bar almost impossibly high for other directors and so it’s perhaps a little unfortunate that Timothy Sheader is first up with All My Sons, the opening production in this year’s season in the Open Air Theatre in Regent’s Park. It’s not that it’s a bad production, not at all, but rather it just feels a little pedestrian, too traditional to really make the heart beat faster in the way brilliant theatre should, and in the way previous productions have done. There are elements that work well – the span of the play over a day is perfectly suited to the night that slowly falls over the park, the planes that fly noisily overhead add a piquancy of their own and the well-cast company are excellent. Tom Mannion’s Joe Keller is the patriarch whose collusion in a terrible fraud hangs ominously like a cloud over his family, Charles Aitken and Amy Nuttall are moving as son Chris and his intended (with strings) Ann and Bríd Brennan is fearsomely fantastic as the delusional Kate."
1102,1102,Ought To Be Clowns,03/05/2015,mag9l,The Verb, ‘To Love’,"For the last two years, Aria Entertainment’s From Page 2 Stage season has been a showcase for new musical theatre writing, providing opportunities for shows like The Route To Happiness and The Return of the Soldier and also allowing writers to get feedback on their work. At the first festival in 2013, writer and composer Andy Collyer noted the positive reception one of his songs – ‘Me and my Chlorophytum’ – received and filing that information away, later returned to it to develop a full piece of musical theatre, The Verb, ‘To Love’, directed here by Jonathan O’Boyle. Taking the form of a song cycle, almost entirely sung-through, Collyer explores the romantic affairs of a 40-something guy called Simon. Reeling from the end of a 23 year relationship, his attention soon lands on a young colleague Ben who is showing a keen interest and we follow them from the heady days of lustful flirtations through changing Facebook statuses, getting a flat and a dog and other such joys of a long-term relationship to the more challenging times of mistrust, selfishness and Facebook stalking. Collyer’s writing is deliberately universal, taking pains to point out in a programme note that we’re all a “potential Simon or Ben” and it is true – who hasn’t made demands of a partner hoping for their sacrifice, or made such sacrifices hoping they’ll paper over the cracks. There’s amusing diversions through online dating and taking up new hobbies, moving sequences of not knowing how to deal with being alone and crying on the phone, all delivered with unflagging conviction by Martin Neely’s achingly brilliant Simon, blending both emotional frailty and strength through his personal odyssey which sees him not leave the stage once. Gareth Bretherton does double duty as musical director from the piano – disguised under a romantic tumble of flowers by designer Nik Corrall – and also as Ben, interjecting vocally at key moments in the piece. It’s an intriguing decision from Collyer and one that I’m still pondering – whereas it’s good to get this different voice (and it works extremely well in the telephone conversations they share), at other times it is more awkward as the piano prevents them from sharing the scene effectively. I suspect I’ll need to see the show again to make up my mind and it’ll be no hardship at all to hear them both sing again. "
1103,1103,Ought To Be Clowns,15/12/2016,mag9l,Mary Stuart, Almeida,
1104,1104,Ought To Be Clowns,23/07/2011,Ian,Four Nights in Knaresborough, Southwark Playhouse,"Four Nights in Knaresborough takes a rather unique look at events around a significant moment in medieval English history: the assassination of Thomas à Becket in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. Paul Webb’s play, presented here by co-producers Rooster and MokitaGrit at the Southwark Playhouse, looks at the four knights of Henry II’s court who carried out the murder of the troublesome Archbishop and follows them as they hole up in a drafty castle in deepest Yorkshire, visiting them four times over the course of a year as they wait, and wait, unsure of just what is going to happen to them. The promotional material cites a modern day sensibility that has “more in common with Tarantino than Cadfael” but what the play put me most in mind of, particularly in the first half, was Sam Mendes’ film Jarhead in its portrayal of military men driven stir-crazy, frustratingly forced into an extended waiting game rather than doing what it is that they do best. And so we see the knights here dealing with the mundanity of killing time with tales of constipation, horniness, hunger, sword-polishing, even love, and the funniest scene of emergency medieval dentistry I’ll wager you’ll see all year. But through all the swearing and dick jokes, moments of depth emerge as more serious subjects are also touched upon: the homoerotic ties that underscore notions of chivalric brotherhood, the aching losses they have experienced in the grim reality of a medieval England wracked by years of conflict in The Anarchy, the gravity of the crime they have committed and where it places them on the game-board in the titanic battle between church and state. We come to see the four distinct characters that make up this motley crew: Brito, the youngest of the lot, bristles with a roguish self-confidence and sexual swagger as played by Tom Greaves; Alex Hughes’ Fitz seems borderline-psychotic with his fierce intensity; Morville’s nervy manner betrays his guiltiest of consciences, Lee Williams’ overly foppish portrayal teetering on the edge of mania; and Traci, the most noble of the lot and the most tortured, unable to surrender to his deepest desires, given beautiful life here with a richly nuanced performance from David Sturzaker. The modern aesthetic, emphasised here with Anthony White’s punchy contemporary soundtrack, ensures we’re never in the realm of dusty historical documentary and the use of modern language in all its varied profanity works well when the play wants to be a comedy. But Webb’s writing can’t quite seem to settle and so we lurch to a more serious examination of the spiritual crises that begin to afflict the men, robbing the production of some of its energy yet failing to fully exploit the opportunities to delve into more of the sprawling imperial ambition of Henry II that lies behind the original act. Perversely, his evident desire for this to be also taken seriously as a historical drama act also works against it in the second half: the shift to a more serious tone crucially exposes the anachronisms that we earlier forgave because we were laughing, the importance now accorded to them suddenly makes these modern attitudes much more glaring in this medieval context."
1105,1105,Ought To Be Clowns,29/09/2012,Ian,Mademoiselle Julie, Barbican,"Lyn Gardner recently wrote an interesting piece in the Guardian theatre blog about her desire to see more British directors taking a radical approach to classic plays. She used as her prime example for them to take inspiration from as Benedict Andrews’ modern take on Three Sisters at the Young Vic which has been by and large rapturously received, whilst I found it a highly problematic interpretation. And ever the contrarian, I was surprised to find that the critical reception for Mademoiselle Julie – whose run at the Barbican has just finished – was decidedly lukewarm, given that I thought it was excellent. Between directorial innovations, re-readings of the texts and the behaviours of our own critics, it strikes me that there’s something odd about such a dichotomy. I ought to begin by confessing my complete love for Juliette Binoche. Way back last year when this was first announced (along with Cate Blanchett, that was a good day!), I didn’t hesitate to fork out considerably more money that I am used to in order to get some great stalls seats and it was well worth it, for me at least, and not just because of the thrill of seeing Binoche acting in her mother tongue. Frédéric Fisbach’s production was first seen at the 2011 Festival d’Avignon and re-stages Strindberg’s play in the coolly modernist setting of a swanky penthouse, superbly designed by Laurent P Berger. Terje Sinding has translated the text into French but without updating it, so there are undoubtedly moments where a literal reading of the words creates tension – the nineteenth century references at odds with this contemporary world – the questions of gender hypocrisy, the transience of sexual desire as the basis for relationships and the potentially transformative power of love remain at the heart of the play.  And the strength of Fisbach’s directorial approach means that to focus on the incongruities of the text vis-à-vis a classical interpretation is to miss the direction that this production is taking. This is a heightened world of vivid emotion and enthralling strangeness – Binoche literally sparkles in a luxe gold dress and traces the giddily dancing highs and bruisingly visceral lows of the lady of the house whose dalliances with the household staff are shattering the certainties of the world around her. She flows around the stage with ease and dramatic purpose and gives a spell-binding performance throughout. Nicolas Bouchaud’s arrogant Jean is a languorous presence and Bénédicte Cerutti’s cook Kristin, Jean’s partner, is full of quiet dignity. But Fisbach is also concerned with portraying the environment in which these people live. A company of extras dance the night away at the staff party that forms the backdrop for the first part of the play, playing out their own little dramas including one exceptionally long gay kiss, but as the drama progresses they become a Greek chorus of sorts, their masked figures advancing on Julie and Jean in a striking visual. And as the relationship between them is irrevocably changed, so too is the world around them. Interludes that wouldn’t be out of place in a Fever Ray video pop up unexpectedly; Berger’s lighting comes into its own as blood-red darkness suffuses the stage to be later replaced with blinding light; the actors turn to speak to us instead of each other as the intensity of feeling becomes too much. It’s non-naturalistic, unconventionally imaginative, different – all the things Gardner seems keen to encourage.  So it is thus a little surprising that the weight of critical opinion has swung so firmly against this, yet for Three Sisters. Chekhov’s text may have been thoroughly modernised by Andrews but if one is being picky about inconsistent details as reviewers have been about Julie, I don’t think I’ve read a single review that explains the sisters’ paralysis in a modern context, ie why don’t they use their iPhones to check the next train to Moscow and just take it, their tragedy is so rooted in the role of women in turn-of-the-last-century society that fast-forwarding a hundred years yet keeping their problems the same just didn’t make sense to me."
1106,1106,Ought To Be Clowns,20/07/2018,Ian,The White Rose, Brockley Jack,"How do we make the choice to resist? At what point do we decide that enough is enough in the creeping erosion of our democracy? When former foreign secretaries rip up ministerial codes or chief whips ignore Commons voting conventions? When presidents attack their own FBI and defend despots? Some 250,000 bodies may have thronged the streets of London last week to register their disapproval of the US Commander in Chief but what happens when the ‘other side’ has won, when the act of peaceful protest becomes civil disobedience. It is into such a world that The White Rose throws us. It is 1943 and having insinuated their way into every level of German society and instituted a systemic indoctrination of much of the population, the Nazis have been in power for a decade. But the tectonic shifts of World War II have finally started to fall in the Allies’ favour and finding safety in like-minded numbers, students of the University of Munich have coalesced into an underground movement, publishing anti-Nazi leaflets and distributing them across the Fatherland. Could such amazing courage go unpunished?  I don’t think it is too much of a spoiler to say no, no it couldn’t. Ross McGregor’s production (of his own script, from Richard Hanser’s A Noble Treason) opens with Sophie Scholl under interrogation on discovery of some of this literature. And as she’s questioned on her role in the group, which includes her older brother, flashbacks take us into the history of its formation, its growth, its development into a countercultural touchstone. What the play also does is to locate the movement in a nuanced depiction of German society, in a world full of people just doing what they have to do to get by. As tragic as the story of the White Rose rebels is, and take tissues – you will need them, I found these subplots to be infinitely moving. We might like to think of ourselves as freedom fighters to the core but the grim reality is is that the vast majority shut up rather than putting up. And so the mini-tragedies of the man who finds himself an interrogation officer (“Just because I’m Gestapo doesn’t mean I’m a monster”) or the soldier in the Wehrmacht (“If the captain of a boat is bad, that doesn’t mean the boat is bad”) cut incredibly deeply since we can’t help but judge, with the rich benefit of hindsight and the luxury of believing we’d never make such a compromise.  But for all the weight of the subject, The White Rose is engagingly and captivatingly staged, losing none of the visual inventiveness that has characterised so much of Arrows & Traps’ previous work. Even something as simple as the transitions from past to present are faultlessly effective thanks to Ben Jacobs’ lighting and Alistair Lax’s sound work. Contemporary video excerpts set the scene chillingly, flashes of movement work capture something of what must have been the nightmarish reality of living life through this, and a late move to simple reportage underscores the essential humanity that is being explored here, the real lives offered up in hope of a better world. An assured company do the material justice. Lucy Ioannou’s Sophie is a mercurial delight, utterly convinced of the rightness of her actions even as the shadow of its consequences looms ever larger. And in the group around her, Conor Moss’ hugely charismatic Alex and Will Pinchin as zealous older brother Hans stand out and the humour they all bring (check the joke which manages to skewer both Trump and grammar nazis…!) offers a reminder of the resilience of community spirit even in the darkest times. Recommended. "
1107,1107,Ought To Be Clowns,30/09/2009,Ian,Showstopper! The Improvised Musical,,"On this night at the Leicester Square Theatre, we were treated to T-Rexctasy, a tale of love and dinosaurs, featuring songs in Disney, Sondheim and country and western styles amongst others. It was extremely silly, and lots of fun, and you soon realise that the story, such at it is, really isn’t that important and the joy of this is in watching the performers interact and bounce off each other in entertaining and often hilarious ways. Lucy Trodd was the star of this particular show, but Ruth Bratt and Adam Meggido as a double act and Pippa Evans made a very funny group of villagers and all of the performers were on fine form. NB: If you do go, do make lots of suggestions as it makes it more fun, and they thrive off responding to the curveballs people throw at them, plus you only get to make suggestions at the beginning. This is the third time I have seen this show and can vouch that it has been different each time. It really is an impressive spectacle and one comes away from the show with great respect for all of the performers."
1108,1108,Ought To Be Clowns,07/12/2016,mag9l,Strictly Ballroom, West Yorkshire Playhouse,"Hoping for a ten from Len and to avoid the dreaded dis-sah-ter from Craig, Baz Luhrmann’s Strictly Ballroom arrives for its UK premiere at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. Best known in its 1992 film version, it actually began life as a play in the mid-1980s when it became big in Czechoslovakia as well as Luhrmann’s native Australia and perhaps appropriately, it is now Drew McOnie who takes the directorial chair, the choreographer-director’s rising star an ideal fit for a musical all about dance. And what dance it is. We’re in the world of competitive ballroom dancing and we’re treated to a wide range of routines from rehearsals to all-out performances and much inventive work in-between, especially where mirrors are involved. And in all this freedom of expression, there’s a crystal-clear distillation of the story’s message in the sheer joy of dancing for fun and the power of following an individual path. But the show isn’t just dance, it’s words and music as well and there, it is less sure-footed.  The book, originally by Luhrmann and Craig Pearce and adapted here by Terry Johnson, is lacking in the humour it needs to fly, the sharpness to make the camp work. And the emotional beats that should elevate the plotting from Hollywood schmaltz rarely land – in its quieter moments, you can’t help but notice just how dully conventional it all is. The score also misfires, mixing together 80s classics with original songs by Eddie Perfect in a manner that perplexes just as much as it pleases."
1109,1109,Ought To Be Clowns,27/07/2011,Ian,There is a War, National Theatre,"When he is being sharply satirical, Basden is at his best and it shows in the great opening third of the show and the way he skewers the group mentalities that emerge. Whether it is the meaningless bureaucracy of the military, the lengths some people are driven to to avoid certain things, the hypocrisy of the peace protestors, or the sheer ridiculousness of a conflict that no-one is 100% sure about – exactly how different is blue from grey anyway… – yet they all take part in it anyway, he mines a brilliantly dark shaft of humour through the brief appearances of some hilarious characters. Kirsty Bushell’s fantastically-unprepared dance-drama teacher, Trevor Cooper’s Big Dave – advising Richard Hope’s Field Commander Goodman on military strategy, the imprisoned yet chirpy soldier (I think played by Richard Goulding): they all help play up the absurdity of the situation. But Basden also has a serious point to make about the horrendous effects of the mindlessness of war and one that becomes increasingly important as the play progresses, to the severe detriment of the humour. Throughout the show we follow Anne, a young doctor as played by Phoebe Fox who has been drafted into the army, and it is through her bemused eyes that we see much of the randomness unfolding. Yet it isn’t abundantly clear why she is so ignorant of everything that has been going on – she is constantly surprised by things yet we’re given to believe the conflict has been raging for ages – her naïveté becomes quite annoying as does the over-riding desire to find the hospital which drives her continued journey to a rather baffling finale. Having opened with such a humourous sequence of scenes, I couldn’t help but feel disappointed at the way the black comedy petered out yet wasn’t replaced by anything as equally strong. Basden shows us a society almost completely dehumanised but there’s little genuine sense of tragedy about it, rather the easy manipulation of some singing trying its best to mask a dulling sense of repetition as we grind to a conclusion which felt a long time coming and even then, only offering a frustratingly undeveloped hint of the Machiavellian forces at play that were keeping this artificial conflict going. There’s definitely something here, not least in Basden’s innate deep understanding of what ‘darkly comic’ actually means and an ensemble throwing themselves into it with gusto, but not even the thrill of Trystan Gravelle’s singing could really save the relatively weak way it ends."
1110,1110,Ought To Be Clowns,05/07/2011,Ian,Directors Showcase, Orange Tree,"Bringing the Orange Tree Theatre’s Spring season to a close in their annual Director’s Showcase, a double bill directed by two young hopefuls from their Trainee Director scheme and an opportunity for aspiring directors to get that valuable first step on the ladder. This they do with the two shows Then The Snow Came and Winter, both utilising some of the cast from the recently finished show Three Farces. Then The Snow Came, both written and directed by Jimmy Grimes, is a devised piece incorporating verbatim dialogue, improvised sequences, a brief foray into puppetry and a recurring motif of Oscar Wilde’s The Happy Prince into this tale of two homeless men on the less salubrious side of the streets of Richmond. The collaborative nature of the whole show is evident in the grim richness of the sense of authenticity that emanates from all aspects thereof. As the two men, Kieron Jecchinis and Daniel Cheyne are both impressive: Jecchinis’ brash Mickey tempered by the more philosophical Stu as the amble around Richmond, shooting the breeze on all kinds of subjects and the breaking the heart as family issues for one of them threaten their fragile friendship. Ed Bennett amusingly pops up as a number of supporting characters and the overall sense is of a compassionate, bruisingly powerful drama. My only reservation came with, predictably, the puppetry. Not so much because I’m not a fan of it but more the fact that it was so brief and utilised so little. I know that the evening is called a Showcase but this did feel a little bit like ‘look what I can do’ rather than being particularly well-integrated into the show. But a thrilling piece of new writing that one could well believe will have future life. Fosse seems to polarise opinions like nothing else and on previous form there is no reason why anyone, least of all myself, would expect this to be a playwright that engages me. But there’s something in the elliptical minimalism that appealed to me, the challenge to the audience member to leap from realism into something much more ephemeral and making their own connections to the material, that made the Young Vic’s I Am The Wind a surprising success for me. Translated here by Ann Henning Jocelyn, Fosse’s 2000 play Winter opens with a harried businessman encountering a young woman in the middle of some kind of traumatic episode – drugs, prostitution, nothing is clear but he shows her sympathy and invites her back to his hotel room. Their relationship then takes an unexpected turn as he decides to leave his family and job for her and as we progress, not everything is necessarily how it seemed. Perhaps it is the knowledge that it is European writing and therefore ‘different’, or perhaps a touch of would-be pretentiousness on my part, but for whatever reason, there’s something in here that connects with me. And though the text is often dense and repetitive, Jennifer Higham and Stuart Fox’s persuasive performances suggest the depth of the metaphorical imaginings behind Fosse’s work, he’s not so interested in just representing life on the stage but exploring motivations and connections in a more figurative way."
1111,1111,Ought To Be Clowns,26/03/2017,mag9l,Othello, Sam Wanamaker,"In light of Roman Tragedies reminding us of the vast potential of what Shakespeare can be rather than the tendency towards the ‘proper’ readings of his work that we tend to get here in the UK (vast generalisations I know, but can you really argue against it…), it’s gratifying to see directors, and venues, taking the opportunity to stretch those traditional notions. The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, housed within Shakespeare’s Globe, isn’t the first place you’d think of to find such a production but in Ellen MacDougall’s interpretation of Othello, we have just that. Text updated to the 21st century (dramaturgy by Joel Horwood), key characters regendered (Joanna Horton’s Cassio is an inspired move), a contemporary soundtrack that interpolates Lana Del Rey, it is enough to make any purist shiver and you kinda feel that’s the point. MacDougall refocuses the play on masculinity in crisis but it is also tempting to think that on a larger scale, there’s a smidgen of Emma Rice’s shaking of the branches of theatrical orthodoxy at play here too. With the post of Artistic Director of the Globe being advertised again, we can only hope such invention remains. For it is an inventive take on the play. Natalie Klamar’s distinctive Desdemona and Thalissa Teixeira’s fantastic Emilia (almost reaching the heights of Alexandra Gilbreath’s definitive (for me) performance) foreground its feminism; Sam Spruell’s Iago is less a silky orator than a brutal bully of the Trump variety who bulldozes Kurt Egyiawan’s Othello into the morass of sexual jealousy that is his undoing. And in the atmospheric surroundings of this playhouse, MacDougall and designer Fly Davis play expertly with darkness, throwing previously firmly-held certainties into fresh doubt. But though this is a world steeped in racism and misogyny, it is one that brings those sentiments to the fore sensitively, exposing their systemic hold in this military garrison, in Shakespeare’s England, in contemporary society. The men pull on pronounced cod-pieces to initially amusing effect but there’s no mistaking the brutality of their posturing, the blurring of scenes into each other emphasise the manipulations (Iago nips into the audience to watch his handiwork play out) and the victimisations (Desdemona and Emilia are onstage throughout the second act, wordless witnesses to their plight)."
1112,1112,Ought To Be Clowns,29/08/2014,Ian,Autobahn, King’s Head,"This summer has seen at least two song cycles imported into our theatres from the US (I’ve seen See Rock City… and Edges though there may well have been more) but Neil LaBute’s Autobahn extends the concept to straight drama, subtitled as it is as ‘A Short-Play Cycle’. As with the musicals, what this means is that to search for overarching narratives is a fruitless activity as what we’re presented with is a series of disparate parts with only the loosest thematic continuity. It can help to be forearmed with such knowledge as the experience might otherwise be a little disconcerting. The seven playlets here are linked merely by all taking place in the front seats of a car that is making one kind of journey or another in America, and through the way in which the playwright toys with ideas of language and how people use it. Though given LaBute’s predilection for the darker, seedier side of human nature, we’re often left squirming in the back as unpalatable truths come to light and shocking revelations spill forth.  At its best, Autobahn really crawls beneath the skin as laughter curdles into disgust, the growing sense of unease that permeates the whole show never letting us sit too easily as the characters reveal their true intentions even in the brief moments we see them. Whether the crazed ex of Bench Seat (a brilliant Zoë Swenson-Graham), the reluctant confessor of Merge (a remarkably controlled Sharon Maughan) or the sinister driver of Road Trip (Henry Everett in chilling form), there’s compelling stuff indeed here."
1113,1113,Ought To Be Clowns,23/10/2012,Ian,9 to 5 The Musical, New Wimbledon Theatre,"With a score that incorporates both songs from her back catalogue and newly penned numbers by Dolly Parton and a book from Patricia Resnick, one of the co-writers of the film on which it based which also featured Parton’s screen debut, there was little danger of 9 to 5 The Musical ever veering too far from the template which saw it become a cinematic success. But though its crowd-pleasing adherence to the film brings a definite feel-good factor, which is best characterised by the effervescent opening rendition of the title song, it also imposes limits on just how successful a piece of musical theatre it can be.   It’s 1979 and the office of Consolidated Companies, typical of most workplaces at the time, is a bearpit for the female of the species. But the tide is changing and as three women in this particular environment come together in the face of sexist adversity and an inadvertent deployment of some rat poison, an alternative way of running the company springs to mind and suggests that the future might not be so grim after all.  Amy Lennox’s Doralee is the pick of the bunch, her twanging charm always sparklingly fresh as she debunks everyone’s misconceptions about her and Jackie Clune’s Violet, seemingly forever destined to be passed over for promotion, is a strong, centring force for the production, although she does occasionally work a little too hard at appearing effortless, thus actually undoing her efforts. Natalie Casey’s newly-divorced Judy is less of a success, her comic performance sits firmly within her well-trodden comfort zone of klutzy mugging and her vocal limitations are exposed in her big solo number, which makes her altogether less of a sympathetic figure than she ought to be. A strong ensemble dance up a storm with director Jeff Calhoun also on choreographer duties,  but Bonnie Langford pretty much steals the show though with a delicious performance as lovesick PA Roz. Still an incredibly vivacious figure with impeccable comic timing, her showstopper Heart to Hart is one of the evening’s genuine highlights. And Ben Richards’ villainous boss is amusingly drawn in pantomime shades of evil, all dastardly swagger and fun with it. "
1114,1114,Ought To Be Clowns,27/05/2017,Ian,While We’re Here, Bush,"I’m not saying I want Barney Norris to write an all-out farce but it would be fun to see him stretch his considerable literary talent beyond these tales of gentle melancholy that he does so well. While We’re Here doesn’t technically suffer for being in immediately recognisable territory but equally, it doesn’t possess the aching soul that made Visitors a spectacular success.  The ordinary lives under the microscope here are Carol and Eddie’s, lovers from 20 years ago who reconnect when she finds him sleeping rough in their hometown of Havant. Under these strange new circumstances, Norris looks at whether relationships can ever be rekindled or is late-in-life happiness just a myth. Directed by regular collaborator Alice Hamilton, While We’re Here inaugurates the Bush’s new studio space. It is compellingly acted by Tessa Peake-Jones and Andrew French in the well-observed detail of James Perkins’ design, but the play suffers from a lack of depth. With relatively little time to play with, Norris never really lets us see what might have brought this couple together in the first place, nor really convince us of what is really holding them together now."
1115,1115,Ought To Be Clowns,27/04/2013,Ian,On Approval, Jermyn Street,"On Approval was written in 1926 by Frederick Lonsdale as a comedy of manners capturing the shifting dynamics in gender roles in a world where suffragists and the Great War had ushered in the potential for great change. Against this backdrop, Lonsdale posits a scenario with two wealthy woman – one a young pickle heiress, the other an older spoilt widow – seeking to test drive potential future spouses by taking them up to a Scottish country estate ‘on approval’ and spending a few weeks together to test their compatibility. But though the promise of a witty evening is often raised, its light-hearted nature too often feels insubstantial. Anthony Biggs’ production polishes the play hard but never really comes up with the cut-glass sharpness needed to elevate the performances above the comic shortcomings of the writing nor the crispness of pacing that would create an irresistible forward momentum. The intimacy of the Jermyn Street Theatre doesn’t always help, leaving the quartet of actors frequently exposed at the lack of solid dramatic foundation and missing the gumption necessary to paper over the cracks.  The normally reliable Sara Crowe gets most of the best lines as the widowed Maria Wislake as her narcissism drives even the most patient of men – her plodding suitor Richard, played by Daniel Hill – to distraction, but not even her strengths seem well-suited here. Louise Calf as the younger woman Helen never really settles into the role and casts too much uncertainty over how her scenes are going to be played out, which in turns leaves her would-be paramour – Peter Sandys Clarke’s egotistical and haughty Duke – stranded in something of a no-man’s land yet always on the cusp of a grandstandingly big performance."
1116,1116,Ought To Be Clowns,17/02/2009,Ian,Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, National Theatre,"Joseph Millson plays a political dissenter locked up in a Soviet mental institution and shares a cell with another patient, played by Toby Jones, who believes he has a full orchestra in his head. The set-up with the orchestra being right there on stage is quite effective, and the sections where the characters interact with the orchestra were very funny, and the players played on very gamely in the face of some severe distractions. Where I felt this didn’t work however, was when the acting was just front-stage, the orchestra ended up being a distraction or vice versa. This was no more apparent than in a very moving speech given by Millson about the treatment of his fellow dissidents. During this, members of the orchestra stood and proffered their instruments from their seats which was an extremely striking visual, and very moving too. For me though, the combination of the two was too much, maybe I need to learn to multi-task but I found I could not concentrate on both things at the same time. But this didn’t happen too often fortunately."
1117,1117,Ought To Be Clowns,20/11/2016,mag9l,Women Centre Stage: Power Play Festival, Hampstead,"With over 100 cast, writers, directors and crew, and 25 plays (none of which were by Agatha Christie!) spread over 7 programmes, Sphinx Theatre’s Women Centre Stage: Power Play Festival was a full-on day indeed for those of us who stayed the course from midday to nearly 10pm, with scarcely time to imbibe yet another coffee as we moved from rehearsal room to studio to main house. But though I was 90% caffeine by the end, the buzz I was experiencing was one of delight at the sheer breadth and quality of the theatre we’d been privileged to witness. The Women Centre Stage Festival was initiated by Sphinx to bring together artists, venues, commissioners and funders in expanding the range of women’s roles and this it has done in a number of different ways. Workshops ran throughout the week at the Actors Centre, a panel discussion broached the larger question of how to improve gender equality in theatre and the plays that were presented throughout the festival’s performance day ranged from works commissioned and developed from the 2105 festival, to the fruits of Sphinx Writers Group, to rapid responses to this week’s headlines. (Slightly) more detailed reviews of each of the sessions are linked below: But I wanted to highlight some of my favourite works of the days – the writers, plays and performances that made me sit up and pay (even more) attention and which will be well worth keeping an eye out for in the future. Camilla Harding and Alexandra Sinclair’s Man Up! was an astonishing look at the fluidity of gender identity and a challenge to the norms that society imposes, Claire-Louise Cordwell’s idiosyncratic abuse survivor in Justice has the makings of an epic character, and it was a pleasure to revisit Chloe Todd Fordham’s agonisingly poignant The Nightclub alongside new work from Dawn King and Jessica Siân, Marlene Sidaway’s liberated widow simply joyous. But the standout programme for me was New Women, consisting of three stonkingly good pieces. How could I not love The Hiccup Project’s May-We-Go-Round with its Spice Girls, Pulp and Cher routines but the knowing glint in the eyes of Cristina Mackerron and Chess Dillon-Reams lends an intriguing depth to their comedy slash dance slash performance art awesomeness – I can’t wait to see them again. Winsome Pinnock’s hypnotic Tituba recasts The Crucible as a slave narrative to glorious effect as delivered by the smokily charismatic Cecilia Noble. And April de Angelis’ razor-sharp Wilderness saw Janet Suzman and Kathryn Pogson wage amusing battle over mental health."
1118,1118,Ought To Be Clowns,23/11/2010,Ian,Showstopper! with the West End Whingers, Kings Head Theatre,"The show was Dametastick!! a tale of two theatrical divas, narcoleptic Andromeda Dench and Philomena Smith with a wooden leg, old drama school chums from the Rah-Dah estranged after marrying the same man, though at different times but now both in the twilight of their careers auditioning for the same part in The Grapes of Froth, a production being put on a pub theatre with pretensions of becoming an opera house and directed by the man who had been married to them both. Highly silly, highly amusing and enlivened even further by the requirements of the plot, including a tap routine whilst eating cream crackers, a grape-treading number that involved yodelling and a coup de théâtre at the finale which was so amazing it couldn’t even be mentioned until the very moment it came to pass. At least those were the things I could remember, the Whingers really packed a lot into their allotted 80 minutes! I’m a big fan of Showstopper! having seen it at least three times before now and I never grow tired of it as it really does prove to be different every time yet always extremely funny. There’s a rotating team of twelve performers, there tends to be six at any one show, with one extra marshalling the fun, in this case it was Sean McCann directing, interjecting and increasing the madness. This time round, Ruth Bratt (far right on the picture) was just brilliant: I’ve been lucky enough to see her every time I’ve seen the show and she is probably my favorite performer out of all of them, seemingly always on the verge of corpsing yet delivering laughs, put-downs, ripostes with consummate ease. As Philomena, her best moment was the Sondheim take-off ‘Park Benches and Balloons’ which practically redefined the balloon metaphor for the modern age. Pippa Evans (second left)was also excellent as Andromeda, her biggest rival, with the unenviable task of prat-falling several times as her narcolepsy took hold but doing it so very well and her big number, ‘Worcestershire (The Source of Me)’ (geddit?!) sung in a Lloyd-Webber stylee was also great fun. Adam Meggido (far left) gave excellent support with his mime antics, Sarah-Louise Young and Andrew Pugsley’s inexplicably French producers were amusing and Oliver Senton as the magic man between our two divas gave good smoulder. Whilst much of the humour comes from the material itself (watching five people stuff their faces with crackers and pretending to tap dance is naturally hysterical), it is the random tangents that shoot off that cause the biggest laughs. A wistful song depicting the central love triangle took a bizarrely surreal turn as the lyrics turned to talk of ‘breasts of jam’ and ‘arms of ham’ (I think!) adding to the mayhem and general hilarity. And it is truly remarkable how in tune with each other the ensemble is, able to pick up on a line or a refrain and spin out harmonies and ad libs, again though it is delicious on the rare occasions when one performer moves a little too quickly for the other and loses them and quick recoveries become necessary. But as well as the actors, the musicians, under Duncan Walsh-Atkins’ musical direction and the lighting guys deserve a mention to in responding so well and so ingeniously quickly (especially with the magic trick!) to the fast unfolding events on the stage. Altogether, the whole team creates something special which always feels perfectly fresh and genuinely interactive, they’re obviously having a ball on stage but it is so inclusive that it is impossible not to be swept away with them. If one is being picky, then one might say that this didn’t quite have the same free-flowing looseness and natural improvisation that previous Showstoppers I’ve seen have had, perhaps due to the sheer amount of material the Whingers had put forth but this is a teeny minor gripe in what was a hugely enjoyable evening. And though it was highly illuminating to see the kind of play the West End Whingers dream of seeing, (I wouldn’t put it past them to try and get this onto the stage themselves!), the fun for future audiences is in creating their own shows with this supremely talented and inventive ensemble."
1119,1119,Ought To Be Clowns,29/11/2014,Ian,A Farewell To Arms, The Old Market Brighton,"Combining theatre and film with text and technology, Imitating the Dog’s adaptation of Ernest Hemingway’s 1929 novel A Farewell To Arms is an adventurous trek into multimedia storytelling. Andrew Quick and Pete Brooks’ direction sees the leads filmed live but separately, the footage combined into a single scene on large screens all around; Simon Wainwright’s video design sees pages of Hemingway’s book projected onto walls as the words deconstruct and dissolve around the actors; the adaptation foregrounds the epic love story between US ambulance driver Frederic Henry and British Catherine Barkley play out against the final year of the First World War, but it also sees the company commenting on and questioning the action even as they’re acting it out. Furthermore for this performance (which I only later discovered was captioned as opposed to them being an integral part of the design) were the subtitles, adding in an extra layer to the potent mixture as another iteration of Hemingway’s narrative voice. The resulting interplay between the various media added a most fascinating texture – the text a constant reminder of its novel form, the minor variations uttered by the performers an indication of the artificiality of said context, and the live video slipping in and out of sync heightening the theatricality, becoming something more than just a simple replication of what is occurring but an interpretation of it, an alternative version even. The post-show discussion revealed a fair few people disgruntled by the time lag but for me it niggled with interest. A consequence of all this innovation is that traditional notions of acting aren’t emphasised anywhere near as much as one might expect but again, within the theatrical world created here the decisions feel justified. Jude Monk McGowan brings an ideal brooding machismo to the narrating Henry and Laura Atherton captures the brittle nature of Catherine, consumed entirely by desire as their passionate affair takes them through love and war and childbirth. Joshua Johnson, Morven Macbeth, Matt Prendergast and Marco Rossi multi-role around them, sometimes in Italian and French, and the moments when the conceit breaks really stand out – Atherton/Catherine bristling at a mention of Henry being with other women during a scene she wasn’t technically ‘in’ being a striking example. Aaand here comes the disclaimer. I ummed and aahed over where this should go, if anywhere at all, and I still haven’t quite figured it out but for what it’s worth, Laura Atherton is my cousin, my second cousin on my mother’s side to be precise. This is the first time I’ve seen her act professionally – she probably won’t thank me for mentioning the last performance I saw her give was a stunning interpretation of a reindeer in the Boxing Day pantomime at my Uncle Andy and Aunty Ann’s house last year (directed with no little panache by my niece Amélie Galbraith, a name to watch out for in the future, mark my words!) – however as there’s no etiquette guide on bloggers reviewing relatives, it’s hard to know whether declaring an interest is necessary or not. I’ve done it now though, so do with it what you will."

1121,1121,Ought To Be Clowns,22/09/2018,Ian,Sweet Charity, Nottingham Playhouse,"So pleased to have managed to squeak into Nottingham Playhouse’s Sweet Charity before it finished, this is what everyone uses their annual leave for, right…?! The second major production of the show in recent months following the Watermill’s strong actor-muso interpretation this summer, it is one which makes a bold move in introducing Alistair David’s choreography to give this 1966 musical a fresh lick of paint. It’s the only real sense of updating that Bill Buckhurst’s production provides but it is an impactful one, David reimagining almost wholesale and invigorating the almost-too-familiar sounds of Cy Coleman’s classic score. In takis’ podium-based design, it looks a dream and more than justifies new AD Adam Lenson’s decision to reintroduce musicals to the programme here after an absence of more than a decade.  And in casting Rebecca Trehearn as its star, it could scarce have chosen better. Trehearn sounds like a dream throughout, of course she does, but what this role does is to really let her flex her acting chops and reveal how good a comedian she is. Goofy without being gormless, sweet without ever letting us forget how smart, and sensitive too – it’s impossible not to be entirely affected by her everytime her heart gets bruised. "
1122,1122,Ought To Be Clowns,05/07/2014,mag9l,Billy Liar, Royal Exchange,"Hmmm. Trekking my way through this list can prove a little hard-going when it throws up plays like these… Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall’s Billy Liar might have been acclaimed as a Great British classic but in Sam Yates’ production for the Royal Exchange, its charms weren’t immediately clear to me. Much of it lies in the play itself I feel, a slice of late-1950s northern life from which dreamer Billy frequently escapes through the flights of fancy in his mind. Trapped by immutable social strictures and parental expectation, he fantasises and lies his way through the day, as he dreams of leaving the day job (at the undertakers) and moving to London to become a writer for comedians. But the excitement is in the dreaming rather than the doing, so a strange state of affairs exists where he spins and invents and even destroys his actual world without any real sense that he might actually get up and go. Harry McEntire’s Billy inhabits the dreamy nature a little too fully to ever really convince of the darkness and desperation that surely lies beneath the surface of someone who is, no matter how big the twinkle in his eye, deeply disturbed. This tweeness runs through Yates’ production like a treacly river which might as well have a sign over it saying “aw, shucks” as bemusement and tolerance are the watchwords rather than any sort of reality check of working class life."
1123,1123,Ought To Be Clowns,28/01/2016,mag9l,Springtime for Henry (and Barbara), Wilton’s Music Hall,"It’s a real shame that Springtime for Henry (and Barbara) only ran for three performances over two nights as I’d’ve recommended it to all and sundry, not least for capturing the spirit of exactly what Wilton’s Music Hall should be used for. A highly idiosyncratic piece, described as “a fictitious lost musical reconstructed in fragments”, it’s the continuation of a multi-phase project by artist Mel Brimfield and musician Gwyneth Herbert, interrogating the relationship between sculptors Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. This it does imaginatively in a number of ways: a mockumentary format (calling to mind nothing so much as the genius behind-the-scenes episode of Acorn Antiques) detailing decades of attempts to put this show on the stage, complete with abortive scores from Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber and a high cast turnover; repurposed archive footage; a chat show section interviewing the ‘director’; and an impressively wide-ranging set of musical numbers, referencing a equally wide set of influences. The cumulative effect was very much of a variety show and that just felt perfect in the atmospheric surroundings of this oldest surviving music hall in the world. And it was a most beguiling confection. The friendly rivalry between Hepworth and Moore provides a constant stream of inspiration – most notably in amusing duet ‘Adel Rock’ which sees them each respond to the Yorkshire landscape in very different ways (imagine a duet between Jake Thackray and Kate Bush if you will) Andrew C Wadsworth and Herbert combining to beautiful effect. I also really enjoyed the musically inventive opening number, which featured the Starling Arts Choir harmonising beautifully as sopranos, altos and tenors extolled the virtues of working with marble, plaster and bronze.  David Bedella was great value for money as the glad-handing schmoozing director, losing control of his animatronic props; Hugh Ross was wonderfully dry as the presenter keen on minimising the role of Barbara in the show; and as the woman seemingly destined to be in Moore’s shadow forever, Frances Ruffelle (a previous collaborator with Herbert on The A-Z of Mrs P) got a show-stopper of a number (and a gorgeous dark green dressing gown!) which combined humour with real insight into gender parity in a male-dominated world, Herbert’s lyrical intent brilliantly executed here. "
1124,1124,Ought To Be Clowns,16/02/2017,mag9l,Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, Crucible,"We should be talking about Sheffield, and how its place in the fragile ecosystem of British musical theatre has only become more and more invaluable. Nurturing shows like Flowers For Mrs Harris and This Is My Family into existence and taking pride in their understated nature, the venue has also been incubating new writing talent. Well, new to musical theatre at least, for Dan Gillespie Sells is the lead singer-songwriter of The Feeling and Tom MacRae has written several episodes of Doctor Who and sitcom Threesome. And inspired by a BBC3 documentary, a meeting with director Jonathan Butterell and a fairy godmother-like intervention from Michael Ball, the result is brand spanking new musical Everybody’s Talking About Jamie. And what a joy it is, a breath of feel-good fresh air that can’t help but leave you feeling fabulous. With career advice flying by unheeded, all 16-year-old Jamie is really bothered about as his school-time comes to an end is whether he will attend the school prom as his drag persona Mimi Me or not. And rather brilliantly, the writing hones in on Jamie just as a young man – yes he’s queer and a kween but he’s also a person still finding out the extent of his identity and how to relate to a wider world that isn’t necessarily always set against him. It’s a refreshing take on LGBT+ storytelling, and a sorely needed one, tipping its hat to the tales of coming out and battling against intolerance that have gone before and then finding its own space to parse the consequences of being this fierce in the real world. As the precocious Jamie, John McCrea is all kinds of brilliant – as awful as Phi Phi O’Hara, as insightful as Katya Zamolodchikova, with as conflicted a parental relationship as Kim Chi, sometimes all within the same withering line, his is a story that can’t help but pummel you with its poignancy. And that is due to the richness of the world around him and the people in it, superbly written and powerfully performed down to the last. Lucie Shorthouse’s Pritti, Jamie’s Muslim best friend, has her own chrysalis to cast off as she emerges into glorious self-confidence; and Josie Walker (the original Mrs Wormwood lest you forget) is phenomenal as his beautifully supportive mother, always trying to compensate for the father who rejects him. They, and the company, all deliver the torch songs and impassioned pop of Gillespie Sells’ bright score with real conviction. And MacRae’s script is chock-full of real humour, Charles Dale as Jamie’s drag mother Hugo aka Loco Chanel gets several great lines, “I’ll do your eyebrows, I’ll make you beautiful, and you can borrow some tits from t’tit box” being the one that has stuck in my head. Anna Fleischle’s set design looks like a dream but Kate Prince’s choreography proves a little over-emphatically poppy in a first half that could perhaps do with just a bit of a trim and a tuck. But make no mistake, Everybody’s Talking About Jamie is rightly, unashamedly proud of what it is – don’t wait and see if a transfer is in the offing, make the time to go and see it now. "
1125,1125,Ought To Be Clowns,15/05/2012,Ian,Brimstone and Treacle, Arcola,"There was something depressingly predictable about the announcement of the Arcola’s new development plans for the summer which will involve moving the one space I think does work in their new premises – Studio 2 – down one level into the basement. So it was with a sad heart that I took my seat for the final production in its current state, a rare revival of Dennis Potter’s Brimstone and Treacle which of course played beautifully to the studio’s strengths. The intimate space becomes the claustrophobic home of the Bates family with parents Tom and Amy struggling to look after their daughter Pattie who was practically paralysed by a hit-and-run accident two years previously and can’t do anything for herself any more. When a devilishly handsome stranger insinuates his way into their household, claiming to have had a close connection with Pattie before she died, he really puts the cat amongst the pigeons and changes their lives irrevocably. Potter originally wrote this for television but it was considered so shocking that it lay unreleased for over 10 years. For he goes dark here, extremely so as it turns out where Martin’s motives for offering to help out with caring for Pattie really lie, but in the midst of the action (and there’s only really the one really shocking moment, albeit quite considerably so) he does raise interesting questions about concepts of good and evil and what happens the latter leads to the former."
1126,1126,Ought To Be Clowns,25/03/2011,Ian,The Harvest, Royal Court,"The Royal Court’s International Playwrights Season turns its gaze to Eastern Europe now, with main show the Latvian Remembrance Day opening this week and two rehearsed readings accompanying it from other former Soviet countries. The first was from Belarus, The Harvest by Pavel Pryazhko and translated here by Sasha Dugdale, a deceptively simple but wickedly funny comedy about four young people picking apples in an orchard. I’ve enjoyed the previous readings I’ve been to so I would most likely have booked for this one anyway, but as soon as I discovered that the much-lauded (on this blog at least!) John Heffernan was taking part, it was a no-brainer. But it was also pleasing to see the rest of the cast being interesting names too: David Dawson (an alumnus of Posh from downstairs here), and Laura Elphinstone and Emily Taaffe, both of whom I’ve seen and liked but in fairly serious roles, so it was a great pleasure to see everyone breaking loose and playing with the daftness in the comedy of Pryazhko’s writing and all doing really well. I don’t think there’s any way to do the play justice in just how funny it was by describing what happened as it was basically four people making a hash of what should have been quite a simple job as basic common sense eludes some, masculine egos get in the way for others and those pesky apples just won’t stay in their crates. James McDonald’s enthusiastic direction made this one of the most ‘acted’ readings I’ve been to, with lots of movement which certainly helped, but possibly the funniest aspect was Kevin McMonagle’s dry narration of the stage directions, never has ‘it started to snow’ sounded so funny."
1127,1127,Ought To Be Clowns,19/11/2018,Ian,Hadestown, National Theatre,"I loved Hadestown so much that I had booked to see it for a second time before I even got home from the first. Read more about that trip here, including me trying the National’s new smart caption glasses, and read on for a review that focuses properly on Anaïs Mitchell’s brilliant musical here. An adaptation of the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, developed with director Rachel Chavkin, it riffs on the myth by relocating the action to a dive bar in the Deep South and redefines hell for our capitalist age. And they fill the Olivier with music, such music, that transforms Hadestown into the kind of experience that lingers long in the mind.  Mitchell’s score succeeds so much because it establishes such an identity for itself that it dares you not to be seduced into the world of the gods, or at least New Orleans. At its best, its simply elemental – ‘Way Down Hadestown’ has the kind of tune that sounds like it has always existed and will not quit your brain anytime soon. And as you collect the influences – hints of Jason Robert Brown on ‘All I’ve Ever Known’, the Johnny Cash-esque call and response of ‘Why We Build The Wall’, the straight up musical theatre emotion of ‘Wait For Me”s chorus, to name but a few – you realise a new form of Americana has evolved here.  From the indecent growl of Nathaniel Cross’ trombone to the rippling arpeggios of Mike Guy’s piano, the onstage band are an absolute treat to watch. But Chavkin’s production soars just as much on its casting. Eva Noblezada and Reeve Carney pair well as Eurydice and Orpheus, his f*ckboy musician ways winning her over despite her initially sceptical nature. But they are Jack-and-Karen’d (or Bernardo-and-Anita’d – pick your reference) out of the limelight by the scorching duo of Patrick Page’s Hades and Amber Gray’s Persephone. He’s got the kinda growl in his voice that brings to mind an aeroplane engine and she has all the propulsive energy of that plane taking off and together, they’re just hypnotic as they detail their own love story for the ages. With a dapper André De Shields as MC-of-sorts Hermes supporting from the sidelines, The Fates – Cary Mercedes Dyer, Rosie Fletcher and Gloria Onitiri – forever insinuating their way into the action with their stunning harmonies, and a crack ensemble who slickly deliver the kinetic force of David Neumann’s choreography, Hadestown really is a feast for the senses.  If you were so inclined, you might point out that there isn’t the hugest amount of dramatic tension here, especially if you are familiar with the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. But there’s just so much on offer here, in the beautifully detailed set (Rachel Hauck) that both contains and opens out the action, that it would take a stubborn soul to resist the spell of Hadestown. Orpheus can honestly be booted off stage for all I care.  the music style he was given of ultrabland indie rocker was just so blah, especially in comparison to everyone else’s."
1128,1128,Ought To Be Clowns,12/02/2018,Ian,Gundog, Royal Court,"There’s something unremittingly bleak about Simon Longman’s Gundog that makes it a real challenge. It’s an impressively bold depiction of the complete decline of a way of life, the kind of rural farming that the Common Agricultural Policy hasn’t managed to reach and protect. None of the loneliness or impoverished desperation is spared in what can feel a tad like punishment by the end.  After the death of their parents, and with their grandfather’s illness and their brother’s listlessness, sisters Anna and Becky find themselves landed with the thankless task of looking after the remotest of farms in an area that can’t even sustain a local pub. The arrival of a foreigner with a nifty line in knitwear is a rare harkening of the potential of change but we’re never allowed to forget that times really are tough.    Longman spreads his play over several years, shifting around with time-jumps here and there, but the relentlessness of the abiding mood of the characters means that it has little real dramatic impact. There are intermittent bright spots, particularly in the sparkiness of Ria Zmitrowicz’s Becky (a more deserving candidate for a Denise Gough-style breakthrough I can’t think) and Alec Secareanu’s nuanced Guy (making me remember I really need to get round to watching God’s Own Country). But in the claustrophobic atmosphere of Chloe Lamford’s design, Vicky Featherstone’s production provides too little variation of tone, especially as Longman’s storytelling resists the propulsion of forward narrative. Which is ultimately tough-going to be sure – even as good as the best, most thought-provoking moments of this play are – and making Gundog just a little bit harder to bear than it necessarily needs to be. Running time: 100 minutes

1130,1130,Ought To Be Clowns,11/03/2014,mag9l,Richard III, Blue Elephant,"Lazarus Theatre’s reimagining of Shakespeare’s Richard III starts off in striking style in the Blue Elephant’s black box auditorium – a genteel drinks reception quickly turns into an all-out rave complete with glowsticks, from the midst of which Prince Plockey’s usurping monarch emerges to deliver “now is the winter of our discontent”. What follows doesn’t quite match up to this vibrant invention but Gavin Harrington-Odedra’s production does contain some lovely moments. Harrington-Odedra has trimmed down the text to a mighty lean 100 minutes straight through which presents as many obstacles as it does opportunities. Richard’s rise to the throne is meteoric which robs us of much of his scheming character, and some of the remaining scene choices don’t always fly, Lady Anne’s seduction for one feeling a little too static. But the strong use of visuals works extremely well in this fast-paced world. The numerous murders are vividly, gruesomely portrayed, borrowing a Dexter-like aesthetic under Stuart Glover’s pinpoint lighting. And there’s some use of movement which is effective but under-utilised. The text work is also variable, Plockey cannily plays the king without any visible deformity which focuses more on the slipperiness of his machinations and the subtleness of his duplicity, and Rhys Bevan’s Richmond makes a stirring leader as he seizes control at Bosworth Field."
1131,1131,Ought To Be Clowns,11/04/2019,Ian,Abigail’s Party, Opera House Manchester,"I spotted at least two people dressed up as Beverly at this matinée of Abigail’s Party at Manchester’s Opera House, a sure sign of cult status for any play. But it also means that their particular version of it can be stuck in aspic, making it difficult for any new interpretation to break through one’s own pre-programmed laugh track, to offer up a new reading of an oh-so-familiar text. I’m as guilty of this as anyone – for me, ‘Demis Roussos’ is up there with ‘a handbag’ in terms of iconic lines – but Mike Leigh’s play has always struck me as a desperately sad one rather than an out and out comedy. Last year’s production at Hornchurch and the Menier’s 2012 production brought those sour notes but interestingly, Sarah Esdaile’s touring production opts for out and out farce. It’s a choice that pays off cannily, especially in Jodie Prenger’s accomplished performance, full of all the sledgehammer acerbity she can muster and an almost parodic physical presence as she wields her bosom as a weapon. The pay-off may be that she’s a comic rather than tragicomic figure but in the larger picture of Janet Bird’s perfectly detailed set design, it kinda works. So too with the darker tones of Ange and Tony’s marriage. There’s some disturbing stuff here from Vicky Binns and Calum Callaghan but much of it gets lost in the laughter, culminating in some extraordinary funny business as the curtain falls. But even that can be interpreted as a signifier of just how much women were forced to put up with in the name of marriage."

1133,1133,Ought To Be Clowns,13/07/2013,Ian,Macbeth, St Peter’s Church Manchester,"One of the big ticket numbers in the Manchester International Festival this year has to be the return of Kenneth Branagh to Shakespeare, with him taking on the role of Macbeth in a production that was surrounded in secrecy and full of advisory warnings to the lucky few with tickets such as “don’t wear any dry-clean only outfits”, “you may not leave your seat once it has started” and possibly the toughest given its 2 hour interval-free running time, “no toilets in the venue”. That venue has now been revealed to be St Peter’s Church in Ancoats, a deconsecrated space used by the Hallé orchestra to rehearse in and whilst the toilets may be five minutes away at Murray’s Mill where tickets are collected from, any fears of emerging from the show drenched in mud and/or blood were left unfounded. One can see straightaway though why the warnings have been made. The audience is placed in traverse either side of an earth-covered aisle and within moments of the start, a huge battle rages just inches from the audience with rain pouring, mud churning and sparks flying as swords clash. It’s an incredibly visceral start to a frequently breath-taking production – co-directed by Branagh and Rob Ashford – which successfully marries tradition with innovation, reinvigorating rather than reinventing Shakespeare’s timeless tale of the corrupting influence of power and ambition. Ashford’s eye for theatrical spectacle is combined with Branagh’s acute Shakespearean expertise and together, create something uniquely special. This is a Macbeth unafraid to show us everything. So that opening battle is fought in front of us rather than just reported, we see an actual dagger floating in the air (courtesy of Paul Kieve’s illusion work and neatly attributed here to the weird sisters), Duncan’s bloody gruesome murder is presented for our delectation, necks are broken, children gutted, nothing spared. The staging of the cauldron scene has to be seen to be believed with its fiery heat and impressively long line of future kings but there’s subtlety too in amongst the bombast. The way in which Duncan’s funeral procession merges seamlessly into Macbeth’s coronation epitomises the maxim ‘the King is dead, long life the King’ – the endless cycle of power ever-revolving. But along with the headlong rush of events, something the removal of the interval really helps with, is the beautiful detail of a simply great lead performance. It was a genuine privilege to see Branagh work so brilliantly, to get the chance to see just why his reputation as one of the pre-eminent Shakespearean actors of our time is so well deserved. His interpretation shimmers with the freshness of something genuinely new, an insight into Macbeth’s psyche that illuminates just as much as it entertains. This is as power-hungry a man as we’ve ever seen, but what really chills is the way that guilt corrodes him from the inside out, his certainty marked by a slight hesitance over key words, his conscience unable to be assuaged as he retreats into the foetal position. Branagh never leaves us in any doubt as to the bleakness of Macbeth’s world or the turmoil that wracks his very soul.  Against such a performance, it would be easy for an ensemble to coast by on the merits of its star, but a weightily impressive array of actors ensure that this is not the case. Not everyone is as successful of course – Jimmy Yuill’s Banquo is incongruously old, Ray Fearon overeggs Macduff’s grief whilst remaining strong elsewhere and Alex Kingston’s Lady Macbeth starts off with an exaggerated almost-campness but fortunately calms down with a chilling sense of control. John Shrapnel’s Duncan is an all-too-short fierce delight though and the murderers stand out with some vivid characterisation, again in the briefest of moments that they are allowed. And Alexander Vlahos makes as compelling a Malcolm as I’ve ever seen, giving us a clearly defined maturing process so that his final elevation feels just natural. The logistics of converting a found space does mean that there are some challenges to the experience though, not least the faff of being seated. The business of allocating numbered seats on the order of purchase means that some lucky people get in the front row but others, who have also paid the flat fee of £65, end up behind pillars in what would be sold as restricted view seats in any regular theatre. A cushion is highly advised as the seating is on wooden blocks and take a bottle of water, it got uncomfortably hot on the evening we were there. "

1135,1135,Ought To Be Clowns,14/04/2011,Ian,Precious Little Talent, Trafalgar Studios 2,"The story revolves around George (Gelder), an English academic in his early 60s living in New York and suffering from early onset dementia. His estranged 23 year old daughter Joey comes to visit unexpectedly, unable to get work in England and espying perceived opportunities in Obama’s ‘new’ USA, but with the help of his carer, 19 year old American Sam, he tries to hide the truth of his deterioration from her. But hiding his symptoms is easier said than done and when Sam falls head over heels for Joey though she does not know his real relationship to her father, the truth about the connections between these people and how far apart they really are comes to light. And as with so many shows that come loaded with expectation, I have to say I was a little disappointed. Hickson has an engaging way with words, there is no doubting that, and some of her speeches especially those delivered by Gelder about the loss of language for someone who holds it so dear are just beautiful. But her canvas for the other characters, in particular Joey, is simply too vast for it to be truly effective. She hits on mixed-race marriages, the UK economy, graduate career prospects, American patriotism, yet doesn’t really delve into and explore them properly: the hints of interest abandoned as half-formed thoughts and the easy humour of culture-clash repeated just a little too often."

1137,1137,Ought To Be Clowns,16/07/2011,Ian,Danger: Memory!, Jermyn Street,"Danger: Memory! is a double bill of Arthur Miller one-act plays showing at the Jermyn Street Theatre, offering the first chance to see these short works in London for over twenty years. Written in 1987 when he was in his 70s, the two pieces investigate the varying significance of memory and how we can use it to both comfort and protect ourselves. I Can’t Remember Anything is the first play, a two-hander featuring a pair of elderly New England neighbours meeting for dinner as is part of their routine. Routine has become important as Leo, a retired engineer, is beginning to lose some of his mental sharpness, but Leonora’s memory is failing much more dramatically. Played by real-life husband and wife David Burke and Anna Calder-Marshall, there’s a really touching brittleness to the way in which they play off each other, constantly at odds and unable to agree on anything as their vibrant lives as are touched back on with varying degrees of lucidity, fading memory unable to destroy their beautifully easy rapport. The second play Clara I found to be less entertaining. A story sparked by the murder of a young woman in a less than salubrious part of New York where the investigating detective is pumping the victim’s father for details of her private life which he apparently can’t remember. It emerges that her boyfriend was in fact Puerto Rican and so his amnesia is more self-protective than genuine as it goes against his liberal principles – which are detailed from way back through his life – to identify him. Though acted well by Rolf Saxon as the father and Roger Sloman as the combative detective, with support from Laura Pyper as the daughter who is featured in key flashbacks, it never quite achieves the moral authority it aims for, its construction too visibly apparent."
1138,1138,Ought To Be Clowns,11/02/2011,Ian,Miss Nightingale – the musical, King’s Head,"Currently playing in the late night slot at the King’s Head Theatre is new musical Miss Nightingale. It is the baby of Matthew Bugg who wrote the music and lyrics as well as the book and also serves as director here. Set in wartime London 1942, it weaves together the stories of three people, a nurse who longs to become a cabaret star, her Polish-Jewish songwriter and the owner of the club who could make everything happen. But whilst the show has fun charting the sensational rise to fame of the titular Miss Nightingale, it also looks at the experience of homosexual men during wartime, at a time when the relative permissiveness of the 20s and 30s gave way to a dangerous paranoia as songwriter George starts a furtively hidden affair with the aristocratic club owner Sir Frank Connor. The two strands are woven together throughout in a way which sometimes worked and sometimes didn’t. Bugg has had a great time composing a set of songs for Miss Nightingale which could have come straight out of Cabaret or Chicago and they are delivered with a nice saucy twinkle by Amber Topaz who rises above the limited scope offered by the set most effectively. The more ‘regular’ songs are less memorable it has to be said, though he has also constructed a nice set of trio songs where all three voices are allowed to intertwine and harmonise in an engaging way. Because many of the songs are performance numbers rather than songs that actually further the narrative, it did feel like there was too much story and not enough room to really portray these relationships as fully as they ought to have been. Too many scenes were far too short and though the performances of Ilan Goodman as the passionate émigré shocked by the changing world around him (and also doubling up as a clarinet player in the band) and Richard Shelton as the society man who will do anything to keep his sexuality secret were persuasive, they were defeated at times by a script that leapt from issue to issue a bit too jerkily."
1139,1139,Ought To Be Clowns,05/07/2013,Ian,Mint, Royal Court,"The Royal Court’s weekly rep season has been about promoting new writers but the name Clare Lizzimore may already be familiar to some, as indeed it was to me and making me more intrigued to see her play – Mint – than any of the others. She has worked as a director for a few years now, creating some excellent work in intimate surroundings like Mike Bartlett’s Bull at Sheffield’s Studio and One Day When We Were Young as part of Paines Plough’s Roundabout season. But Mint marks her first foray into playwriting, as part of the Royal Court’s Jerwood New Playwrights programme.  And whether through design or just a happy accident of fate, it reunites Lizzimore with Sam Troughton – most excellent in Bull – who takes on the lead role of Alan and delivers one of the finest performances this season has seen so far. Alan is facing a five year prison sentence for an unspecified act of robbery and as he serves his time, we see the snippets of normality he is allowed to experience through the weekly visits from his family. The banter with his slightly older sister, the bickering with his much younger sister, the grim disapproval of his stern father, the blithe but affected nonchalance of his uncomprehending mother. But the play also covers the three years after his release as it turns out being released ain’t as easy as all that.  The first part is excellently done, the swift passage of time clearly signposted with landmark events – marriage, babies, university – and the sibling relationships are acutely well-observed. Laura Elphinstone’s Stephanie trying her best but struggling to deal with the reality of it all, especially as it impacts on her domestic life, and Angela Terence’s Nicola maturing before our very eyes from a stroppy schoolgirl to the young woman who understands the world much more deeply – her wordless (re)acting in the final scene is a masterpiece of subtle but keenly felt emotion. And a constant presence throughout, Troughton’s Alan is a ball of powerful but confused feeling. An evident lack of remorse means he is constantly on the defensive, unsure why he is garnering more sympathy from his family and frustrated at a prison system that keeps transferring him from institution to institution. The relationship with his parents – Debbie Chazen and Alan Williams – is less well drawn though, suffering from the economy of information that raises questions rather than just intriguing the audience, and particularly in the final scene which very much feels like something ought to have preceded it to give us some context that would make more sense. "
1140,1140,Ought To Be Clowns,03/10/2011,Ian,Off Cut Festival Group 1, Riverside Studios,"The Off Cut Festival is a short play festival that is taking place over the next few weeks at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. It is quite an ambitious project which is bringing together 28 writers who have all come up with 15 minute plays and being staged here in four groups of seven with a creative team of over 80 actors and directors, the eventual winner receiving a full commission. I was actually part of a group of bloggers who were responsible for choosing a small handful of the plays that were included in the final 28 but I can’t really claim any responsibility here, it has all been down to the hard-working folks at In Company Theatre who have put together the whole shebang, something which must have been a logistical nightmare but which has come together nicely. It is fascinating to see the different ways in which writers approach the 15 minute brief and the differing styles, subject matters and tones employed across the seven plays I saw this afternoon, which is then multiplied by four across the entire final shortlist. In some ways, it is easiest to go for comedy which makes the greatest initial impact but then it is not always so simple to make people laugh – as evidenced by a couple of these pieces in which the jokes often fell flat – and there’s something to be said for the more elliptical entries which entice you into their strange little worlds and are unafraid to leave questions unanswered, situations unresolved, but the interest most definitely piqued. For me, the best of these managed to combine the two in some measure and so the three plays that got my vote (the two plays receiving the most overall votes will go through to the final week) were Lauren Spring’s Granted…, a twisted tale of a marriage gone wrong with the wife desperate to entice her husband once again, even though he is off to spend the night with his lover; Ross Howard’s The Viewing – a slightly surreal story of a family looking around a property abroad that they are determined to take, notwithstanding their difficult family issues and Wally Sewell’s The Wrong Tree, perhaps the least complex but straight-up funniest of the lot with Bob and Caroline, a miserably married couple eating breakfast silently but Bob’s internal monologue given hilarious human form in the shape of Inner Bob. Funnily enough, the one that was selected by us bloggers, They F*** You Up Your Mum and Dad by Michael O’Hanlon, seemed to pale a little bit by comparison. It remained extremely funny as I remembered it, but the construction did quite work dramatically, the disappearance of the Mother in particular seeming like an odd choice. But it still entertained, and I was intrigued by Tracy Harris’ A Million Things as well, that coming fourth on my list. Across the plays, there was a lot of strong acting going on which was all the more impressive given the limited time granted to make an impact. I enjoyed Victoria Allies and Stephen Fawkes as the estranged couple of Granted…, Zak Rowlands’ faint disgust as a cameraman for a flirtatious OAP’s video dating entry, Nathan Thompson and Richard Fish’s connectivity as Outer and Inner Bob respectively and the largesse of Duncan Pearse’s keen estate agent. So an interesting experience altogether and in its support for new writers (and indeed the whole creative personnel involved), a richly rewarding endeavour. I just hope the ones I voted for make it through to the final! Groups three and four play next week so why not pop along and support some new play writing."
1141,1141,Ought To Be Clowns,26/11/2014,Ian,The Hypochondriac, Richmond Theatre,"Queer, faggot, poof, shirtlifter…it’s the kind of language that is thankfully becoming rarer in public discourse and yet, it still creeps in with an alarming regularity that means it will be a long time before it truly becomes verboten in a similar manner to the n-word. I raise this as Richard Bean’s recent playwriting is particularly guilty of this – Great Britain had multiple references (though with no published script, I can’t quote ‘em), Made in Dagenham had a handful of faggots and his version of The Hypochondriac features poofs and AIDS jokes, delivered without irony in front of a replica of Gilbert and George’s Spunk Blood Piss Shit Spit. The arguments are easily made – ‘oh, that is what people said in today’s tabloid offices/1970s factories/sixteenth century France’ – but the worry, for me, comes in the audience reaction and the legitimisation that is implicit in the inclusion of such language in a comedic environment. It is an assumption I’m making but it really doesn’t feel like the laughter that comes from a character being labelled a faggot or poof comes from a good place, or any kind of interrogation of what it means to use such words. Which is pretty much where my mind was at whilst watching the latter stages of the curious Theatre Royal Bath production of The Hypochondriac at Richmond Theatre. Molière’s final work has been adapted into a scatological farce (a slightly terrifying prospect as a sub-genre) by Bean in a manner similar to that of One Man, Two Guvnors with musical interludes interspersed throughout. But where the skiffle-influenced songs of The Craze fit perfectly into the 60s world of that play, Richard Thomas’ songs – here delivered by a goth-like Andrew Bevis – have no contextual place in the 17th century world of the show. Instead, they’re just window-dressing, setting the mainly puerile sense of humour (one of the songs is called ‘Blood in my Poo’) that governs the show as the neurotic Argan battles his hypochondria forever inspecting his bodily waste, the doctors who seek to take advantage with endless enemas and his scheming wife Beline who also has her eye on his fortune. With his sweet-natured daughter and canny maid on his side, there’s sadly little suspense or real dramatic interest about what turns out to be a rather workmanlike character for the inimitably charismatic Tony Robinson. The real strength in Lindsay Posner and Lisa Blair’s co-directed production ends up coming in little moments from the supporting roles and cameos – the pleasure of Imogen Stubbs’ reactive disdain as the grasping Beline, the manic energy of Tracie Bennett’s companion-like Toinette, the genuine emotion of Lisa Diveney’s Angelique who is equally exasperated and endeared to her father. There’s also an insane performance, which is also quite possibly brilliant, from Craig Gazey as an eminently unsuitable suitor for her hand which has to be seen to be believed."
1142,1142,Ought To Be Clowns,07/01/2011,Ian,The Potting Shed, Finborough,"The first show of 2011 for the Finborough Theatre is The Potting Shed, a Graham Greene play from 1958. A psychological drama about a man, James Callifer, estranged from his dying father and struggling to make sense of gaps in his memory from his teenage years at the family home. For as James delves deeper into his troubled psyche, long buried family secrets threaten to bubble to the surface, beliefs questioned, indeed the very nature of religious faith is brought to bear as James edges ever closer to the truth of what happened in the potting shed from which the play takes its name. This production ran in the Sunday/Monday slot late last year and has been promoted to a full run, managing to hold onto all but two of the original cast. Part of the 3 month RediscoveriesUK season at the Finborough, dusting off little-performed shows from all over the UK, the programme unearths great little snippets like the fact that this particular play hasn’t been performed in London for 40 years and leading that production was none other than Cliff Richard. Unfortunately that was about as interesting as it got for me, as this was not a play that really engaged me at all. There was something to admire in Eileen Battye’s brittle mother and 25 year old Zoe Thorne’s precocious 13 year old Anne but the acting was solid rather than outstanding for me, and given that most of the cast are used to this space, there were some surprisingly shouty performances. All in all though, I just did not find this to be a believable set of characters with too many secondary ones who only appear for part of a scene and a central family that I had little interest in seeing work through their issues, no empathy was built up in any of the relationships. The grand revelation when it comes was a strong scene with particularly good work from Martin Wimbush as a priest struggling with a crisis of faith, but it was then undermined by a misjudged second interval which led into a very underwhelming short final act. Ultimately, this just wasn’t the play for me, I just found it dull. Clearly the Finborough have seen something in it, good enough to warrant bringing the show back, but I did not believe that this was a good enough play to really deserve a revival but more importantly struggled to see what it has to say to modern audiences. Oh good. I was kind of feeling like my January is tight and this is now one I can totally pass on. Yeah, not one for me, but I'm not really a Graham Greene aficionado. I imagine it will get fairly positive write-ups as the type of thing critics will 'get' but I think we would be in (rare) agreement on this for once."
1143,1143,Ought To Be Clowns,10/11/2011,Ian,The Lion in Winter, Theatre Royal Haymarket,"I have to start this review off with an apology to my Medieval History A-Level teacher Mrs Grist. Despite having spent two years studying the subject, and writing an extended essay on the Capetian King Philip Augustus (who appears as a young man in this play), precious little of the detail has remained in my head. Fortunately James Goldman’s The Lion In Winter, Trevor Nunn’s latest entry in his Theatre Royal Haymarket season, has a rather loose basis in history, coming from the Philippa Gregory-type school of soapy melodrama rather striving for historical accuracy, and so the vagueness of my recollections was just fine as this ends up being more of an Ayckbourn-style domestic conflict piece – Season’s Greetings but with a cast of historical royals instead. Things get off to a rather shaky start with a huge amount of backstory text scrolling up the screen, which is surrounded by the cheapest-looking holly border straight out of a clip-art folder. It is a rather unwieldy way to convey a ton of information which if significant, ought to be clear anyway from strong playwriting. But in a nutshell, the play is set at Christmastime 1183 in the château of Chinon, Anjou in Western France where Henry II of England has kept his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, prisoner for a decade after she led a rebellion against him. Accompanying the warring couple are their three sons, Richard, Geoffrey and John, who are all competing for their father’s favour in order to be named his successor and their guest, King Philip II of France, whose half-sister Alais just happens to be Richard’s fiancée and Henry’s mistress. And for two and a half hour, they all jockey for position with each other, trying to work out who will end up on top. Despite the historical context, it’s actually quite a light-hearted romp which revels in its anachronisms – there’s a Christmas tree complete with neatly wrapped presents – and its modern approach to motherhood and love. Nunn has cast quite cleverly in employing Robert Lindsay and Joanna Lumley as the central couple as they both seem to be having a ball and fit quite neatly into the entertainment role – this isn’t heavyweight, serious stuff by any means, but then it has no pretensions to be so and Lumley in particular is fantastic as the most regal yet still slightly camp Eleanor. Instead, we get the battle of wills between Henry and Eleanor as he flaunts his mistress in front of her and the squabbling between the three sons: Richard (the Lionheart), his mother’s favourite; John (he of the Magna Carta), his father’s preferred son; and Geoffrey, the other one. The play burbles along quite nicely for the first half and reaches its comedic heights early in the second with an excellently executed scene, almost akin to farce, set in the King of France’s bedroom, full of unexpected twists, revelations and hiding places. This is then followed by a rather touching scene of rueful reminiscence between Henry and Eleanor: Lindsay and Lumley bringing their experience to bear to suggest the passion that once lay there and the world of recriminations now in its place. But Goldman’s writing quickly begins to lose steam from here on as this scene goes on for far too long and the rest of the second half then lumbers its way to its end point, dragging its heels without any real sense of building to a dramatic crescendo. Tom Bateman makes a charismatic Richard, James Norton’s overlooked Geoffrey and Joseph Drake’s petulant John all have fun as the warring siblings (although I think Drake could afford to tone the spoilt brat notes down a little) in what end up as characters of relatively limited scope. Sonya Cassidy has an initial sweet naïveté but needs to work a little on a more convincing shift to the coldly calculating woman she’s meant to become; Rory Fleck-Byrne emerges well as the young French King learning quickly about his English rival’s game playing and stepping up to the mark himself. Stephen Brimson Lewis’ design opens up the stage to some considerable depth to evoke the vast expanse of the castle chambers and corridors yet also keeping a claustrophobic intimacy as these family members drive each other up the wall. Once it becomes evident that The Lion in Winter is having fun with history and creating an immediately recognisable family drama, it actually becomes rather good fun, up to a point. There’s little that Nunn’s production can do when the play falls away at the aforementioned point early in the second half meaning that there was something of a slog to the end for me, but there’s definitely some entertainment along the way."
1144,1144,Ought To Be Clowns,22/10/2015,mag9l,Mary Poppins, Curve,"It is becoming increasingly clear that a show isn’t a show if a Strallen isn’t involved, even as an usher, and it is now the turn of Zizi to ascend to the role of leading lady, taking the title role in a mammoth UK tour of Mary Poppins which has started at the Curve in Leicester and which is already booking through to this time next year. And it isn’t too hard to see why such confidence has been invested in the future of the show when it is as stupendously good a piece of musical theatre as this. I never got round to seeing the show in the West End – Julian Fellowes’ book building on P.L. Travers’ original books as well as the Disney film and composing duo Stiles + Drewe adding to the iconic score by the Sherman Brothers – and it’s an age since I saw the film so it really did have all the glorious impact of being a fresh new show for me but even if you did manage to see it, the lure of this fresh new production ought to tempt you along to one of the cities where it is playing to relive the joy. From the sparkling choreography from Matthew Bourne and Stephen Mear – both revisiting and revitalising so many famous sequences – to Bob Crowley’s set design – which allows for all sorts of magical treats to be conjured from the stage – tour director James Powell brings a wonderful sense of occasion to the show, spectacle going hand in hand with real emotion as the familial trials of the Banks are placed front and centre, Milo Twomey and Rebecca Lock as the parents really are excellent. The kids are a treat too (Madeline Banbury and Colby Mulgrew at this performance) taken on this heart-warming journey by Matt Lee’s hugely charming Bert and Strallen’s intriguing take on the titular nanny, an almost abrasive disciplinarian to begin with who only truly warms up in the second act. She sings and dances (and flies) like a dream though, confidence exuding across the stage in the set pieces (even if the unexpected musical highlight was her duet of ‘Feed The Birds’ with Grainne Reniham’s Bird Woman)."

1146,1146,Ought To Be Clowns,11/08/2011,Ian,The Globe Mysteries, Shakespeare’s Globe,"It is rare that one witnesses people encouraging the clouds to open at any performance at the Globe, it seems like a needless temptation of fate! But nevertheless, Tony Harrison works in the phrase into this play and on this occasion at least, the heavens did not open (although Mary did still get assumpted!) Starting off with God and the creation and whipping through key stories from the Bible – ostensibly with messages incorporated for us in modern life – until we reach the last judgement, The Globe Mysteries is Tony Harrison’s own adaptation of his 1977 version of The Mysteries for the National Theatre. Played with a cast of 14 who cover over 60 roles between them, we move from the Garden of Eden through Noah to the birth and death of Jesus and then beyond. There’s a rough chronology which sees us sweeping through time so that we end up more or less in a modern-day setting around the time of Jesus’ death which means the whole range of the costume department is exploited. Harrison’s text is a rough kind of verse, with rhyming couplets and modern reference points aplenty but it is a deeply traditional set of stories which doesn’t take well to the transfer and overall, I found it to be rather problematic. Part of my issue is the inconsistency that comes with the constant changes as story rapidly follows story. Some are told with broad comedy, some are told with a tad more angst and violence, and but most are told with a rather uneasy mixture of it all which rarely works. Playing for laughs from the audience whilst kicking Jesus’ prostate body felt very wrong and I couldn’t see what making the men crucifying him into chatty workmen just doing any old job and posing for a photo with the results actually achieved or revealed to us. And the play suffers from the imbalance of the best stories almost all being compressed into the first half, the second act then really does drag: plus watching people act being in religious rapture is one of my least favourite things ever. Part of it is also my personal response to the material (which surprised me as much as anything). The presentation of God as an unshaven, cantankerous misogynistic old man just made me angry in the sadistic things that he does: his refusal to give the women (or remember their) names; the casual cruelty of drowning all those not in Noah’s ark; making Abraham suffer so much; even the ‘cuckolding’ of the unknowing Joseph – they all provoked strong reactions in me because of the way they were presented yet are all dealt with swiftly with this enduring lightness of tone. One can see that a medieval audience would have had a completely different relationship to the play and it is difficult to see how that translates to a modern-day audience, at least the more agnostic among them. I just couldn’t see the value in what was being presented, as stories, as pieces of drama, as anything; indeed I couldn’t tell what the point of the whole thing was in the end but perhaps this speaks more to my attitude towards Biblical stories. The fact that it is all played in a variety of northern accents (with varying success it must be said) was puzzling and a decision which added little. But there’s also a deal of fun in Deborah Bruce’s staging, spreading the action out into the yard with to great effect, especially when the Day of Judgement is looming and the brilliant re-enactment of the Last Supper. The acting is solid rather than spectacular, few people are given the chance to play their characters for more than a few moments and Paul Hunter evidently cannot move a muscle without mugging, something which went beyond tiresome for me. There may be historical value in the Mystery Plays for sure, but attempting to foist a contemporary relevance on them feels rather misjudged and it sits uneasily as a piece of theatre. The website calls it a celebration of “the spirit of medieval street theatre and processional performance” but the truth is for me it failed to really engage on any of these levels and justify its three hour running time. The groundlings got drenched on Saturday, the rain precisely (and I mean precisely) coinciding with the Noah's Ark scene. Some people looked genuinely freaked out, in a ""How did they do that?"" sort of way. It is SO odd to hear you talk about groundlings 😉"

1148,1148,Ought To Be Clowns,31/03/2011,Ian,Sweet Engineering of the Lucid Mind, Hen & Chickens,"Winner of the Off Cut Writing Award 2010 as a 15 minute short, Mitch Féral has now expanded his play, Sweet Engineering of the Lucid Mind, into an 80 minute piece which is playing at the Hen & Chickens at Highbury Corner. It is a tragicomic story of a long-married couple, he an astrophysicist with grand plans about the nature of reality and the possibility of time travel, she a history teacher struggling to deal with the early onset dementia of her once-vibrant husband. Simon Nicholas was strong as the highly intelligent physicist suffering from the slow decline of his mental faculties, and subject to the vagaries of a mind that flits from memory to memory without logic or reason. He captured the quicksilver flashes of mood too, turning almost violent as his frustrations come close to boiling over. But it was Debra Baker as his long-suffering wife who really blew me away with her quietly dignified performance, setting her teeth to the grim reality of full-time caring for a loved one who can’t show gratitude. It is her lucidity that fleshes out the random memories that pop into her husband’s mind, telling the story of their courtship and marriage, the good times of the past which have inevitably turned into the more trying times of the present day, and she really makes one believe the strength of the love between these two people and just why she could never put him into a home. The only thing slightly missing I thought, was a sense of the real anguish and desperation that can strike at even the most devoted of carers, Féral’s composition of the character of the woman lends her the patience of a saint even in the messiest of moments, where a touch more loss of composure might have been placed. Much of Féral’s writing is beautiful though, contrasting his lofty quantum talk with her historical teachings and there’s one lovely phrase that echoes round his mind, serving as an anchor for them both which is oft repeated throughout the show. And just as you think you’ve heard it one too many times, the finality with which Baker delivers the last line of it right near the end of the show is just quietly, devastatingly heartbreaking."
1149,1149,Ought To Be Clowns,14/10/2016,mag9l,Musical of the Year, LOST,"Stephen Lanigan-O’Keeffe and Owain Rose’s Musical of the Year pops up as something of a surprise, a genuinely funny musical theatre extravaganza in the mould of something like Forbidden Broadway as it parodies any number of big musicals from the last 60 years. The conceit is a simple one – the year is 1955 and college sweethearts Rudy Brown and Lizzie Conlon are looking for ways to update a musical they wrote together. They decide to ape the style of the big award-winning musical of the year and when that fails, Rudy tries time and time again. Their show is based on The Hunchback of Notre Dame, so we’re instantly given a helping hand in terms of the story being told. But even then, there’s a clever advancement of the travails of Quasimodo, Esmeralda et al that brings real interest to the songs, in addition to the pastiches that they engender. There’s an occasional urge to overegg the pudding in terms of making sure we ‘get’ it (the shows referenced are all in the programme) but if you can resist, there’s real joy in working out what’s coming next and its plot will be intertwined with the events of the show."
1150,1150,Ought To Be Clowns,01/12/2017,Ian,La Soirée, Aldwych,"Variety is the spice of life and it’s a taste we apparently can’t get enough of, it would seem. Brett Haylock, Mark Rubinstein and Mick Perrin’s La Soirée has been around in one form or another (previously called La Clique) for well over ten years and the grandeur of the venues it has played has grown from unused casinos to Spiegeltents to finally now, when it has taken up residence in the West End itself, in a reconfigured Aldwych Theatre. La Soirée is a scrumptious smörgåsbord of entertainment, an ever-changing line-up of acrobats and daredevils and comedians and burlesque acts and so on and so forth, who ask you to put your scepticism and reserve to one side for the evening, and just have a real good time. To this end, the bar remains open throughout and if you’re anywhere near the front, then considerable audience participation is a real possibility but roll with it and you might just have the time of your life (like Warren did tonight…!) In some ways, it is a show to be experienced rather than described. I could say that Michele Clark is amazing with her hula hoops but that could never do justice to the way in which she seems to make them float in the air, nor the way in which she turns into a human slinky by the end. And the breathtaking acrobatic feats of the sexually charged pairing of Leon Fagbemi and Klodi Dabkiewicz or the brotherly Indian duo of Rajesh Amrale and Rajesh Rao (with Mallakhamb India!) have to be seen to be believed as they display extraordinary strength and dexterity. The evening is at its best when it has a devilish glint in its eye – Amy G’s roller-skating flamenco dancer amusingly pushes as far as she can in finding her guapo, and Daredevil Chicken’s banana-related antics are pure genius. And when it also works in a subversive twist to its flavour, as it is the muscular frames of Fagbemi and LJ Charles that are exposed in La Serviette, a witty peekaboo act with increasingly small white towels. And when a quick-change routine goes eye-poppingly wrong, again it is the gentleman whose blushes must be spared, (if he were at all interested in sparing them!)/ "
1151,1151,Ought To Be Clowns,12/09/2013,Ian,The Witches of Eastwick, Watermill,"A theatre I hadn’t been to before and a musical I hadn’t heard before – the offer to go and see the Watermill’s adaptation of the 2000 West End show The Witches of Eastwick seemed like a no-brainer. But though I am glad to be able to tick both of those boxes, I have to admit to being rather disappointed with the show and such disillusionment is only magnified when one has made a not inconsiderable effort to go out of town to see a show. As with many of the productions at this venue, it is an actor-musician led revival, directed here by Craig Revel-Horwood and so one is habitually left in awe at the amount of talent being displayed on this cramped stage, I’m just not convinced that this musical is worth it. Written by John Dempsey and Dana P Rowe from John Updike’s novel of the same name, the story focuses on three New England women unhappy with their lot in life who get swept up into the influence of newcomer Darryl Van Horne, whose demonically charming ways transform all their lives as he seduces them one by one. But though it may be better the devil you know, the changes he wreaks threaten to go too far and it proves no easy task to put this particular genie back into the bottle. Tom Rogers’ set design works wonders in such an intimate space, not least with a well-executed flying scene, too many aspects of the production felt problematic to me.  The sound mix was wrong throughout, the music being too loud and obscuring much of the lyrical heft of the show. One can only hope that all the jokes were in these bits as I rarely found myself laughing in something that was described as a musical comedy. And with this lack of comedy came a strangeness of tone to the story, about the inhabitants of this town and their intense unlikeability. There’s little to hold onto in terms of an engaging story, the sympathies not teased out for any character of note, and just not enough charisma present to mean that any of that doesn’t matter."

1153,1153,Ought To Be Clowns,04/06/2015,mag9l,Bend it like Beckham, Phoenix,"Balls – for a show about the beautiful game, none of the various ways in which footballs are actually used really quite worked for me. 
 Enjoyment – though it may be a bit of a cliché, the cast look like they’re having an absolute ball on stage, and their enthusiasm is infectious, especially in the full company numbers, 
 Natalie Dew – from the ballpit at Teh Internet is Serious Business to headlining a West End show in less than a year, it’s a heady rise for Dew but her gorgeous openness makes her a highly engaging lead.
 Dann (Sophie-Louise) – Dagenham’s loss is Southall’s gain: Dann is easily at home with the show’s broadest comic character but still brings forth genuine humour and real emotion in her solo song, which probably the show’s prettiest melody.   Illuminations – there’s much to love in Miriam Buether’s brightly modern set but it is at its best when it lights up the stage
 Time – at 2 hours 50 minutes, I’d say the show is probably a bit too long at the moment so it will be interesting to see if it gets trimmed any more before press night.  Lauren Samuels – another actor I enjoy seeing on stage and again is working a lovely line in earnest determination as Jules, Jess’ friend and mentor on the squad
 Indian music – the Anglo-Indian blend of the score works well throughout but something special happens when Rekha Sawhney sits down to sing a pre-wedding song, a gorgeous mother’s lament that is a spell-binding moment.
 Kalidas (Preeya) – it’s a shame that Jess’ sister Pinky doesn’t have a bigger part in the plot as Kalidas is an electric presence whether acting, singing or dancing, an absolute joy to watch
Ealing – where the show is set and a play to which I have never been."
1154,1154,Ought To Be Clowns,21/11/2014,Ian,Urinetown, Apollo,"Though Urinetown’s run at the St James Theatre was very well-received (including here by yours truly), I have to profess to being a little surprised that a West End transfer was announced. The quirky nature of the show didn’t immediately seem to lend itself to one of the larger houses but without any mid-sized theatres in town, there’s no choice but to supersize when in reality, an extended run at the St James would have been ideal. It was sad to see the house so quiet for this midweek matinée and the run has now been shortened by a couple of weeks to allow My Night With Reg to move in so perhaps it was too hard a sell but Jamie Lloyd’s production certainly has much going for it. A few thoughts follow. It’s nice to see a company supporting its own rather than parachuting in a ‘name’ for the sake of ticket sales and so Richard Fleeshman is replaced as the show’s hero Bobby Strong by Matthew Seadon-Young who has been there from the beginning. And likewise Julie Jupp and Alasdair Buchan will be stepping up to step into the shoes of Jenna Russell and Marc Elliott when they leave at the end of November – it’s a natural and brilliant progression route and it something that should definitely be encouraged. (Naturally the show isn’t immune to economic realities and so it is Phill Jupitus who will be coming in for Simon Paisley Day, an interesting choice but as I’ve never seen him on stage one I’m a little unsure about.)"
1155,1155,Ought To Be Clowns,14/03/2017,mag9l,Honeymoon in Vegas, London Palladium,"The London Musical Theatre Orchestra’s arrival on the scene has not gone unnoticed by me but their previous concerts have always fallen on days when I couldn’t make it. So finally putting a show on on a Sunday night meant I was able to put it in the diary and to mark the occasion, they only went and invited their first guest conductor along, Mr Jason Robert Brown himself to helm the UK premiere of his show Honeymoon in Vegas. And in the swish surroundings of the London Palladium, it was hard not to be entirely seduced by the lush sound of a 30-strong orchestra (under the musical direction of Freddie Tapner), a chorus of 16 up-and-coming performers and a main cast of bona fide West End stars directed by Shaun Kerrison. The concert staging allows for an amusingly slapdash approach which really suited the joie de vivre exuding from pretty much everyone involved here, a real passion project. Honeymoon in Vegas wasn’t the hugest success on Broadway, closing after just a few months and in all honesty, it does have an old-fashionedness to it that never really perks up to speak to a contemporary audience. Andrew Bergman’s book is based on the 1992 film of the same name, about a man struggling to keep the promise he made to his dying mother to never get married. But on deciding to elope to Las Vegas with his girlfriend, Jack finds many many obstacles in his way.  But if the story doesn’t quite hold up, never mind its feminist credentials, the show explodes in technicolor glory due to an expertly cast set of actors. Arthur Darvill (I reckon he did it in Broadchurch!) was hugely charismatic as the hapless Jack, Samantha Barks continuing a rich vein of form (so good in The Last Five Years) as fiancée Betsy, Maisey Bawden’s flirty Mahi, Simon Lipkin’s pair of striking cameos, and Rosie Ashe pretty much stealing the show as the ghost of Jack’s mother, determined to get her way (and enriching a character that barely deserves it)."
1156,1156,Ought To Be Clowns,06/03/2019,Ian,Alys, Always,"In well over 30 years of being a director, it seems scarcely credible that it is only now that Nicholas Hytner is turning his hand to directing a play written by a woman. For all of his considerable contributions to the British theatre ecology, it is a startling and sobering statistic that demonstrates the scale of the problem faced by those who would (rightfully) change the status quo. The play in question here is Alys, Always, written by Lucinda Coxon from Harriet Lane’s 2012 novel. And it proves a serviceable psychological thriller of sorts that sits a little too cosily in the middle class-baiting madeleine-scented air of the Bridge Theatre. It is glossy and magazine-spread chic, undoubtedly shinily cast (Joanne Froggatt, Robert Glenister) but rarely essential. Froggatt plays Frances, a “diary monkey” for the arts section of a Sunday newspaper who is struggling to see any way off the bottom rung off the ladder. When she witnesses a car crash and comforts the driver in her final moments, the last thing she’s expecting is opportunity but when she discovers that the woman was the wife of a famous writer, Frances seizes her chance. Asked by the family to share those final moments, she gets her feet under their table and once there, resolves to never let them leave, inveigling her way into the affections first of distraught daughter Polly and then patriarch Laurence. Her new connections spill over into her work life too, boosting her prospects and awakening an ambition that becomes increasingly ruthless.   So Frances is revealed as something of an anti-hero, the type of woman who’ll give you a hug but be rifling through your handbag as soon as you nip to the loo. Coxon, though Lane, makes the case though that everyone is like that. Her parents are hard work, her journalist colleagues test her patience and the Kytes are upper class twits to a man – all are deserving of what they get? It’s a question that never really gets resolved and so the play ends up feeling slight and inconsequential. Froggatt is excellent as the near ever-present Frances but even as she takes the audience into her confidence, she remains ephemeral with no sense who she is (does she have no friends?) or what her sociopathic tendencies are pushing for. With no obvious resting place for our sympathies, it’s all a bit alienating."
1157,1157,Ought To Be Clowns,27/05/2016,mag9l,Sea Life, Hope Theatre,"In a land with as unreliable a climate as ours, it’s no wonder that there’s something unmistakably weird about English seaside towns outside the height of summer. Would-be sunbathers hunkered down on the beach behind windbreaks, families munching picnics in the car because its raining, hordes of sulky teenagers stalking amusement arcades with little amusement to be found besides the penny pusher, seagulls terrorising tourists with their chip-stealing ways – oh I DO like to be beside the seaside! Lucy Catherine’s new play Sea Life pulls aside that veil of stick-of-rock-scented nostalgia though, to probe deeply into what life might be like for those who actually live in these coastal communities, whilst still investing her story with the kind of brilliantly mordant humour that recalls the likes of The League of Gentlemen. Three siblings are eking out an existence in the town where their family has lived for decades, a community that is seriously under threat from coastal erosion with even the cemetery now at the mercy of the crumbling cliffs. The crisis actually presents an opportunity – older brother Eddie has turned gravedigger to exhume the coffins of those most at risk and his younger twin siblings Bob and Bob (Roberta) carry out makeshift funerals back at the family pub. But over 200 corpses later, Eddie is starting to crack, further isolated by the twins’ innate closeness, Roberta’s agoraphobia shows no signs of abating and though they’re nearly 30, Bob seems unable to cope without having his sister by his side at all times, to the point where they still share a bedroom. Matthew Parker directs this ever-shifting swirl of darkly tragicomic strangeness ambitiously and adroitly. Scenes of actual jaw-dropping audacity rub shoulders with moments of raw grief, especially once we delve into the murky annals of their family history, Laura Harling’s design never letting us forget the infamous shadow of their grandfather. And Philip Matejtschuk’s sound design plays up the eeriness with its snatches of Wurlitzer organ spurting from a jukebox against the incessant lapping of the sea."
1158,1158,Ought To Be Clowns,28/09/2009,Ian,Gina Murray & Anna-Jane Casey, Late Night Cabaret at the Delfont Room,"One or two numbers into the show, Anna-Jane Casey launched into a joke about country & western music and a group of deaf men, which was accompanied by I assume what she considered to be an amusing impersonation of how deaf people talk, which was then repeated several times. Ironically, I don’t even know what the punchline of the joke was since Ms Casey’s delivery was not sufficiently good to reach the side of the room, and the laughs that were being generated as much from her impersonations as the content drowned her out. As a deaf man, I know that this was only really a sensitive issue for myself (and perhaps any other deaf people in attendance) but I was severely disappointed and upset to have paid for an evening’s entertainment only to find myself having to confront the prejudices and mocking that form a part of many disabled people’s everyday life. Perhaps Ms Casey wasn’t to know that her impersonation was just like one of the ways that I was bullied when I was younger, but quite frankly that is beside the point. At best it was highly insensitive, at worst it was downright offensive, it ruined my evening and left me extremely upset. I should probably have left at that point, but wanted to let my companion enjoy the rest of the evening, before letting him know how upset I was as we left. I hope that Ms Casey realises how her lack of sensitivity can be interpreted by the very people she is poking fun at, no matter how innocently, and I would hope that she would refrain from using such behaviour in future."
1159,1159,Ought To Be Clowns,03/06/2008,Ian,The Year of Magical Thinking, National Theatre,"It is painful and at times oddly emotionless: this is mainly due to the analytical nature of the writing. This is no self-indulgent exercise in wallowing but rather a detached examination of the effects of grief. Only occasionally do glimpses of the grieving widow escape, and they are all the more effective for their rarity. Having already done a run on Broadway, we get the benefit of Vanessa Redgrave being intimately comfortable with the material and it shows in her measured but hauntingly beautiful performance. Her mellifluous tones fill the auditorium effortlessly and her stage presence is just captivating, every movement carefully crafted to show how much self-control this woman has over her emotions."
1160,1160,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Hair, Palace Theatre Manchester,"True story, I’m no real big fan of Hair. I’ve seen it a couple of times now and it just doesn’t grab me in the way that so many other classic musicals do. But when looking for a Wednesday matinée to complete my trip to Manchester, it was the only show in town. And given that this Aria Entertainment, Senbla and Hope Mill Theatre production was born here in Manchester, it seemed only right to give it another shot. And I have to say, in its 50th anniversary year, it is beginning to win me over. The music (by Galt MacDermot) may not occupy a special place in my soul and the book (by Gerome Ragni and James Rado) remains chronically weak but there’s something so persuasive about Jonathan O’Boyle’s production that is entirely seductive, and feels even more so in the grander theatres in which it is now touring, as opposed to the more intimate spaces it has previously occupied. Much of this is down to the charisma and talent of a very strong company. It is impossible to listen to the likes of Aiesha Pease’s Dionne and Natalie Green’s Cassie without being agog at their vocal prowess, or to resist Marcus Collins and Tom Bales flirting outrageously with the crowd whether from on the stage or from their actual laps in one case. And with the one storyline that resonates, Paul Wilkins is an impressive figure as the tortured Claude."
1161,1161,Ought To Be Clowns,18/02/2019,Ian,The Martini Encounter in ‘One Night in Little Rimming’, VAULT Festival,"There are some moments of musical genius in The Martini Encounter in ‘One Night in Little Rimming’. A witty take on Talking Heads’ ‘Psycho Killer’, a kazoo-aided bossa nova-inflected version of Alanis Morisette’s ‘You Oughta Know’, a gorgeous uke-heavy rendition of Lily Allen’s ‘Fuck You’. And the medleys – who’d’ve thought ’99 Problems’, ‘My Name Is…’ and The Fresh Prince theme song could all be rapped at the same time and still work, same too with ‘I Predict a Riot, ‘Firestarter’ and ‘Here’s Comes the Hotstepper’. Real kudos to whoever did these arrangements. The repertoire belongs to cabaret act The Martini Encounter who have been disbanded for years. The promise of cold hard cash tempts them out of retirement for one last performance at the Carol Vorderman Playhouse in Little Rimming on Sea, but history weighs heavy on this trio and recriminations spill forth at every opportunity. As they recount the odd tale of their glory days and the many tales of their downfall, you feel the wheels might fall off this bandwagon at any moment."
1162,1162,Ought To Be Clowns,03/10/2018,Ian,Wasted, Southwark Playhouse,Mad short of time this week so I’m just firing this up to say don’t miss the final few performances of Wasted at the Southwark Playhouse.
1163,1163,Ought To Be Clowns,05/10/2013,Ian,Tory Boyz – National Youth Theatre of Great Britain at the Ambassadors Theatre,,"The National Youth Theatre originally commissioned James Graham’s Tory Boyz back in 2008 and given its success, they asked him to update the play so it could form part of their West End repertory season. To describe the Conservative Party’s attitudes towards homosexuality is a near impossibility – whilst the Same Sex Marriage Bill was admirably forced through by Cameron’s administration, the debates around it revealed huge rifts, bemoaning the encroachment of the “aggressive homosexual community” and the spectacular ‘activate the lesbian queen’ debacle – yet it has always been a party with gay members. And it is this dichotomy that Graham explores, how the compatibility of homosexuality and Conservatism has evolved over the years and whether, in this day and age, it does or should matter. Sam (Simon Lennon) is a Tory researcher working in the busy office of an education minister. He’s out to his colleagues but with one eye on a more frontline political position in the near future, he’s more than content to keep it on the QT, much to the chagrin of his fresh-faced Labour opposite number James (Tom Prior) who is trying to coax him into the relationship that they both crave. The discovery that he is working in the same office that Ted Heath started his own career in inspires Sam to research that man and the rumours that swirled around his sexuality – scenes that we see played out in flashback – and in an additional plot, Sam also visits a secondary school to try and engage a disinterested group in politics with a weekly mock-Parliament set up, something which in turn also threatens to lead him to a stronger self-understanding. As shown with his recent National Theatre success This House, Graham can spin the plates of multi-stranded political theatre with great aplomb and one can see the genesis of that play in here, both in structure and in subject. But this does feel like a playwright growing into his strengths though, the overall feel is too disjointed and some of the segments lack clarity for too long – director Thomas Hescott lays the initial focus of the modern-day office too strongly on Sope Dirisu’s hugely charismatic and steam-rollering chief-of-staff Nicholas, the shift in time to Heath’s childhood takes too long to register. Once it settles though, something of an elegiac beauty emerges – Heath’s repeated attempts to telephone through time to the equally fraught Sam recall the emotional resonance of The Pride, Aaron Gordon’s conflicted pupil Ray reminds us that everyone’s journey to self-acceptance is different."
1164,1164,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Killing It, VAULT Festival,"It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, trying to decide what to see in the multitudes of shows that make up the VAULT Festival. But the presence of both Janet Henfrey and Doña Croll in the cast for Killing It made it a no-brainer, it’s just a shame that it is only playing for two nights. Written by Josephine Starte, who also completes the company, Killing It circles around how grief affects those left behind, and how that might vary between different generations. So when a young man goes missing at sea, his girlfriend, his mother and his grandmother try to find a way forward that manages to make that grief useful in the way that society suggests is the right thing to do.  Lily McLeish’s production divides the stage in three with Ant Doran’s lighting delineating the separation most effectively, so that even though the women come together at various times, there’s a clear sense that they’re on individual journeys. At the same time, the wash of Julian Starr’s evocative soundscape hints at the ebb and flow of that grief, how its weight is always there even if it isn’t felt so keenly from time to time. And as Starte’s Molly converts her pain into standup comedy, as Croll’s Vanessa finds escape in making flower arranging videos on YouTube and Henfrey’s Margot plots to assassinate the visiting president, there’s a beautiful, communal warmth to the sharing of these stories, ideal for those moments when you’re not sure if you’re laughing or crying.  "
1165,1165,Ought To Be Clowns,04/10/2012,Ian,Duet for One, Churchill Theatre Bromley,"It took seeing it again to remind me, but Tom Kempinki’s exquisitely moving two-hander Duet for One is one of my favourite plays. I simply adored the Almeida’s 2009 production which starred Juliet Stevenson and Henry Goodman and so when a new touring version directed by Robin Hurford was announced, I was keen to see if I could make it. As it turns out and I don’t know who is responsible for these things, it is a rather limited tour with only 2 of 11 venues north of Cambridge. And it is doubly a shame as this is an excellent piece of theatre that deserves to be seen by more than the small crowd that made it to this midweek matinee. Haydn Gwynne takes on the role of Stephanie Abrahams, a concert violinist whose diagnosis with multiple sclerosis has had a devastating impact on her life, not that she is ready to admit it. Now wheelchair-bound and under her husband’s advisement, she starts seeing William Gaunt’s Albert Feldman, a psychiatrist who attempts to start the painful process of dealing with her new situation, what it means for her life going forward and how experiences of her past also have their part to play in her current emotional state. The play takes the form of a series of sessions between the pair and we follow Stephanie through her initial reluctance, her enduring scepticism, her heart-breaking revelations and the shattering realisation of just how important music is in her life now that she is no longer able to play her beloved violin. Gwynne evokes this journey with a simply sensational performance full of deep intelligence, wry but brittle humour and a searchingly raw emotion. There’s a beautiful economy to her work, meaning the stillness and silences that punctuate her outbursts speak just as loudly as her words, especially in the agonising delving into her thoughts of suicide. Feldman may be a less showy part – Gaunt often goes as far as partially turning his back on the audience when in listening mode – but it is no less moving as his love of classical music binds him perhaps a little closer to this case than most, allowing himself to be tested more than usual. Gaunt also has the wonderful gift of being able to act volumes with silence and so the confrontational scenes between this pair spark with a real charge. Hurford’s direction is beautifully measured, allowing two top class actors to really shine in a piece of powerfully evocative writing."
1166,1166,Ought To Be Clowns,21/05/2012,Ian,Cantina, Priceless London Wonderground,"The ambience is of old-school faded glamour, snippets of jitterbug and lindyhop intermingle with crooning troubadours and music boxes as a 1930s dressed couple take to a high-wire and all seems relatively straight-forwardly traditional. But Cantina is much more progressive the period might suggest as there’s a wittily subversive take on gender relations here that keep things utterly fresh. So where we are introduced to Henna Kaikula’s audaciously flexible broken doll routine, it is soon countered by David Carberry’s near-naked submission to Chelsea MacGuffin’s stilettoed feet all over his body. Indeed couples tussle throughout the 70 minute show: men square up to each other in acrobatic combat, the battle of the sexes is given a thrillingly even-handed treatment in sensuous dance. And there’s thrills to be had in solo moments, especially the breath-taking rope skills of Mozes, who also shows us the best way to use a copy of the Telegraph in one of the evening’s more revealingly risqué moments, whose raw presence electrifies the audience. There’s no narrative to speak of, but in the jaw-dropping moments of circus skill and the wryly amusing cabaret-style humour, it is rarely missed. What we get instead is a highly atmospheric venue filled with boundless physicality and a deeply sexy mood, a company able to grab our attention and willing to toy with it, and us, in a show of great sensuality."
1167,1167,Ought To Be Clowns,04/06/2014,mag9l,Bakersfield Mist, Duchess,"Fortunately the sheer quality of Kathleen Turner’s stage presence means that you should be able to make it through Bakersfield Mist with decent levels of sobriety but only just. For Stephen Sachs’ odd couple/culture clash/art history romp is a most trying piece of theatre indeed, maintaining the Duchess Theatre’s dubious record for hosting some of the most random things. On the one hand, we should celebrate the arrival of a new, original drama in the West End, such a thing is horribly rare but on the other, if this was someone’s first experience of theatre, you wouldn’t lay bets on them booking for anything else in the near future. Turner plays Maude, an ex-bartender who lives in a Californian trailer park where she now collects junk from thrift stores. Most of it is piled up in her abode – meticulously designed by Tom Piper – but the jewel in her crown is a $3 painting which she is convinced is a long-lost Jackson Pollock work, worth millions. So she calls a New York art expert to verify its authenticity and when the snooty Lionel arrives, there’s a clash of personalities as snap judgements are made, about both person and painting, which melds into something more genial as bottles of whiskey are cracked open and barriers brought down in the search for common ground. Sachs has nothing original to say here. Maude is a decent sort because she’s working class, Lionel is funny because he’s a haughty Brit and funny because he’s a snob. It is lazy characterisation through and through and their debates get caught up in these narrowly defined categories from which they’re never allowed to stray. And perhaps conscious of how static this real-time conversation inherently is, Sachs contrives an appalling drunken scene (from which they both sober up unbelievably fast) and pointless noisy mishaps with furniture and Polly Teale’s direction introduces LOTS OF SHOUTING to make sure that we’re all still awake. But nothing adds any substance to the play, despite the best efforts of Turner and Ian McDiarmid going gamely for ham of the year but falling a long way short – quite why he agreed to do this, on the basis of the drunken scene alone, is beyond me and also beyond his not inconsiderable skill to make things tolerable. Cheap tickets are floating around for this and it is not much over an hour long but in all honesty, I would struggle to recommend this to anyone. "
1168,1168,Ought To Be Clowns,18/11/2012,Ian,A Walk Through the End of Time, Orange Tree,"The frustration of the Barnes to Richmond rail replacement bus service (over an hour on this sunny Sunday afternoon) paled into insignificance on reading the background to this rehearsed reading at the Orange Tree. Jessica Duchen’s play A Walk Through the End of Time features an estranged couple who are reunited after 25 years as they prepare to attend a concert performance of Quatuor pour la fin du temps, a piece of music composed by French composer Olivier Messiaen whilst he was held as a prisoner-of-war in the early years of the Second World War. Its unusual make-up, of clarinet, violin, cello and piano, simply reflected the musical ability of his fellow prisoners and its first performance was in 1941 at the prisoner-of-war camp Stalag VIII-A. Duchen’s couple – a woman whose father was imprisoned with Messaien (Harriet Walter) and her scientist ex-husband (Henry Goodman) – leaf through their programmes and discuss the music, the man who wrote it and the men he wrote it for and the terrible circumstances in which it was written. But in doing so, they discuss their own personal history, what happened to them in the past and what has taken place since then, and the reasons why – gods of science are pitted against gods of faith as they try to resolve their differing takes on the world in the hope of finding something together in their future. As a rehearsed reading, I’m not going to pass too much comment, aside from to say it was perfect casting – Walter could read anything and make it sound utterly lived in and heartfelt and Goodman’s kindly wise energy matched up perfectly – and it was interesting to see how differently they’d treated their scripts. Goodman’s was covered in scribbles, underlinings and highlighted lines whereas Walter’s was much neater with all her markings tidily inscribed on the pages."
1169,1169,Ought To Be Clowns,02/06/2011,Ian,Betrayal, Comedy Theatre,"Spread over nine years, 1968 to 1977 to be precise, Betrayal traces the affair between Emma who is cheating on her husband Robert with his best friend Jerry but tells the story in reverse, starting two years after it ended and working its way back to how it all started but exposing the many other betrayals that have plagued the lives of all three protagonists. Harold Pinter’s 1978 play took inspiration from his own extra-marital activities and was seen in London as recently as 2007 at the Donmar but this Ian Rickson-directed production is most notable for marking the return of the luminous Kristin Scott Thomas to the London stage along with co-stars Douglas Henshall and Ben Miles. Never one to look a gift horse in the mouth, I was offered the chance to see this preview from the dress circle which was nice (though I was surprised at how little leg-room there was). Full disclosure here, I love Kristin Scott Thomas I really do: she epitomises elegance for me but I most admire how she has really embraced her bi-lingual position, mixing intriguing French film work in with her English-language performances to develop into a most interesting actress of confounding depth. And here at the Comedy Theatre she displays a delightful girlishness and emotional vulnerability at times which is unlike anything I’ve seen her do: the jealousy in her eyes as Jerry talks of his wife and her fulfilling life is a wonderfully sparky moment. Ben Miles has a fine commanding masculinity about his performance and Douglas Henshall has the most, if not all, of the witty charisma of his jet-setting literary agent. To these ears (which have largely avoided Pinter to be honest) the dialogue sounded impressively natural, as opposed to the poised theatricality exemplified by Deborah Findlay and David Bradley in the recent Moonlight, though I am no unsure what the intended effect here is or indeed if Pinter’s writing in these plays can be so directly compared. But for a work that is lauded as a modern classic and one of Pinter’s finest works, I found myself quite disappointed with the play. Compared to say Moonlight, it is positively straightforward which I was most thankful for but there’s little to no insight on offer here, indeed it ultimately feels more like an apologia for infidelity and there was just too much left undeveloped. Clearly there’s something of an abstract exercise in a play that is essentially fragments of a story winding back in time, but there were big gaps that left me unsatisfied. Jerry’s wife Judith has no voice despite being as impacted as Robert; the moment that the play ultimately builds up to is severely underwhelming, the first act of betrayal seemingly coming far too easily; but most significantly, there’s no interrogation of why or how Jerry could compromise this precious relationship with his best friend, as he often describes him himself, in such an unforgivable way with nary a blink of an eye. Jeremy Herbert’s design allows for the fluid movement of the set from location to location but it did create disarmingly huge spaces at times which Rickson didn’t always fill effectively, the Venice balcony being quite weak. But I did like Stephen Warbeck’s moody music which accompanied the scene transitions, the year being projected onto the back wall through a gauze curtain to guide us through the chronology. There’s some fantastically ugly 70s clothing (plus a gorgeous magenta dress) and a very threatening bedspread. And I was really impressed with the structuring of the play, at two significant moments the rewind button is released and we actually play forward for a couple of scenes to really play out the drama and generate some emotional involvement. All in all, I just don’t think Pinter and I get on, Betrayal left me feeling a little ambivalent – I didn’t come out of the theatre feeling like I’d gained anything revelatory about the experience of infidelity. Still, a great opportunity to see one of our most interesting actresses live on stage though. I saw this on 2 June and was very disappointed. I agree with your points about the weakness of the play, the so-what? feeling it leaves you with, and on the night I went Henshall had a real mare forgetting his lines and mumbling his way through the evening. A few people walked out."
1170,1170,Ought To Be Clowns,26/03/2011,Ian,The Kissing-Dance, Jermyn Street,"Following on from the well-received but prematurely-closed Love Story, The Kissing-Dance reveals a slightly more playful side to Goodall’s composing, embracing an English pastoral influence which allied to the wit of much of Hart’s lyrics, makes this really quite a sprightly affair. There are moments that feel almost like Gilbert & Sullivan, especially in the multi-layered finale to Act 1 with its many counterpointed melodies creating a harmonious delight. It wasn’t always so successful though, the title song feeling a little out of place with the rest of the show and not helped by being sung by the servants oddly, a small thing but still a bump in an otherwise smooth ride. The actor-musician side of things was kept nicely unobtrusive, a wise choice in the limited space of the Jermyn Street, and under Tom Attwood’s musical direction, the heavily-piano based orchestrations worked well, accompanied by violin and a variety of wind instruments. Performance-wise, David Burt and Beverley Klein brought their experience to bear with cracking turns and in the latter case, the most unexpected expletive of the year, but there was also excellent work from defender of the understudies Gina Beck and Gemma Sutton as the sisterly friends with a genuine warmth and connection as they sang and gossiped about their potential love matches, also impressively played by Ian Virgo and Dylan Turner respectively. Jack Shalloo’s roguish Tony Lumpkin was good value for money but a little predictable for me as it was too similar to his most recent role in Departure Lounge, I’d love to see him stretch a little more dramatic muscle so I may have to take in his reprise of Hamlet the Musical."
1171,1171,Ought To Be Clowns,23/07/2010,Ian,The Prince of Homburg, Donmar Warehouse,"The Prince of Homburg by Heinrich von Kleist is this year’s summer play at the Donmar Warehouse marking the return of Ian McDiarmid after Be Near Me last year. Presented in a new version here by Dennis Kelly (who I still haven’t quite forgiven yet for The Gods Weep), it was written in 1811 just before the German Romantic playwright committed suicide, and apparently was one of Hitler’s favourite plays. In order to squeeze this in before my holiday, I ended up seeing the second preview which should be acknowledged when reading my comments. The play follows the titular Prince of Homburg, a shining light in the Prussian Army but possessed of a dreamy waywardness which flies in the face of the strict obedience of the law that typifies Prussian military behaviour and when he defies an order from his father-figure the Elector, matters of courage and honour push them both to a horrifying point of no return. It just didn’t work for me. I wasn’t a fan of the underlying messages of the play, about authority and adhering to the rules at all costs, about facing death with honour and what courage really is. It didn’t help that I didn’t care for the Prince as a character, or Charlie Cox’s rather too earnest interpretation, but the language used throughout was overly florid and felt unnatural and prevented me from caring much about any of the characters. I’ve never felt quite so much like I’ve been watching an actor try out different ways of playing his character in front of me before. Yes, I know it was a preview but these were still £20 tickets and it was just quite a surprise to see McDiarmid seemingly flirting with different characterisations, or perhaps he was just acting and I didn’t get it: the portrayal ended up feeling quite schizophrenic, an authoritative dictator one moment, a comic buffoon the next. In the rest of the ensemble, Siobhan Redmond does well in too small a part, I can never quite get used to her talking without a Scottish accent but she pulls it off fine here; Harry Hadden-Patton delivered a fine performance and Julian Wadham and William Hoyland were also good, but few of the supporting roles are particularly well defined. Visually, it fits into the Donmar aesthetic perfectly but it does just leave the feeling of having seen it all before. It is actually the younger sibling of the Danton’s Death set, all starkly unadorned material (in this case concrete), lighting from on high and a sneaky little gallery moment: all impressive but ultimately uninspiring. The use of music is also predictably ‘epic’, sweeping strings and an ethereal female vocalist, effective but heard so many times before. So all in all a bit of a damp squibfor me: I suspect it will be much smoother by opening night and those expecting a more cerebral, psychological evening will not be disappointed. It just didn’t click for me or deliver enough the freshness that I would have expected from a new Donmar production. Wouldn't it be worth mentioning that Dennis Kelly has completely rewritten the final scene of Kleist's play? This modification explains the inconsistent characterisation of Ian McDiarmid's Elector. The original ending is much more interesting and disturbing than this dumbed-down version. McDiarmid's performance turned out to be the highlight of the production for me. If I had seen the play before then I would have mentioned it, but as it was my first experience of it, I knew no better.  What is the original ending? And Mr Ramon, McDiarmid was the highlight not Cox? You surprise me!!"
1172,1172,Ought To Be Clowns,30/05/2016,mag9l,Y Gwyll / Hinterland Series 2,,"Our appetite for dark crime dramas is seemingly insatiable but it is helped by the quality of programming that is now being sourced from a wide range of countries. One such drama that is closer to home than most is the Welsh-language police procedural Y Gwyll, which is also broadcast in a bilingual English and Welsh format as Hinterland. The 5 part second series of feature-length episodes has just been released on DVD by Nordic Noir and Beyond. Labelled as part of the Celtic Noir movement, it is interesting to try and locate Hinterland in the televisual landscape and it does fall naturally somewhere in the North Sea – the influence of the all-conquering Scandi-crimewave is certainly there, as are hints of something more homegrown – as reductive as comparisons are, I’d say this is a cross between the Icelandic Trapped and bleak West Yorkshire of Happy Valley.  Shot on location in the mid-Wales county of Ceredigion, Hinterland makes fantastic use of the beautiful but often harsh landscape in which it is set. Windswept beaches, isolated farms, unforgiving woodland, these locations are very much a part of the stories being told, particularly in the ways that they have shaped the long-enduring, long-suffering rural communities who lie at the heart of the crimes being committed here. The second series opens with former Met officer DCI Tom Mathias having some of his much-guarded personal life revealed in light of the traumatic events of the last series’ end. Having moved to Ceredigion coast to live in an isolated static caravan with just a photo of two young girls hinting at his past, matters of professional conduct and personal tragedy come to a head with powerfully moving results. Richard Harrington gives us a great grizzled tactiturn detective in Mathias, and his scenes with Anamaria Marinca as his wife, are some of the series’ best. And unwilling – or unable – as he is to show much emotion, the rare moments when something breaks through, whether a scream or a smile, are brilliantly done. As his red mac-sporting sidekick DI Mared Rhys, Mali Harris is a great foil, inscrutable but loyal and unlike Mathias, a vital local link which frequently proves invaluable, reinforced by the rest of their equally bilingual team in Alex Harries and Hannah Daniel.  The five cases featured in this series, written by a scriptwriting team that includes locally-based writers, delve interestingly into this complex rural society, held together by nothing so much as secrets and feuds as anything. The late emphasis on an overarching storyline that harks back to Series 1 and presumably to what will happen in Series 3 is clunkily managed though, pulling focus horribly and confusingly in the final episode in a way that doesn’t necessarily feel needed, the action having already felt suitably epic. Still, Y Gwyll / Hinterland is a worthy addition to the canon of strong crime dramas and particularly interesting as an uncompromisingly Welsh one.  "
1173,1173,Ought To Be Clowns,25/05/2017,Ian,Julius Caesar, Crucible," Robert Hastie’s opening salvo as the new Artistic Director of Sheffield Theatres might not immediately quicken the pulse as we’ve hardly been lacking for productions of Julius Caesar. But it is soon apparent that this is a canny director at work, making his mark on the Crucible Theatre and how its space is used, on our notions of how Shakespeare is traditionally interpreted, establishing what looks like exciting times ahead for Sheffield. With designer Ben Stones, Hastie opens out the stage into a space of transformative and unpredictable power – the modern political arena is evoked with its UN-style chambers and mod-cons but it is just as much the powder-keg of changeable public opinion. And the way in which the two intersect, feed into each other, thus feels as informed by hatemongering Sun or Daily Mail headline-grabbing antics as it does by the words of a sixteenth century writer. Increasingly, that’s where the best modern Shakespearean productions are coming from, the ones that emphasise contemporary resonances whist understanding its classic underpinnings. And Hastie delivers in spades – supernumeraries from Sheffield People’s Theatre heckle loudly from the audience and are as easily incited to mob rule by Elliot Cowan’s excellent Mark Antony as the likes of Katie Hopkins wishes she had the insidious power to do. Zoe Waites’ Cassius tips the gender politics of Jonathan Hyde’s thoroughly old-school Caesar into stark relief, and Samuel West’s Brutus is the embodiment of liberal intellectualism that seems so ill-equipped to deal with a fast-changing world. Their climactic debate is thoroughly scintillating, dimly but evocatively lit by Johanna Town (credit too to Emma Laxton’s sound work and Richard Taylor’s brooding score), a properly titanic struggle. Regime change rarely seemed so exciting."
1174,1174,Ought To Be Clowns,10/11/2015,mag9l,Waste, National Theatre,"It’s always a bit tough to forge one’s own opinion of something already lauded as a masterpiece, the assumption being if you don’t like it then you’re missing something, but this is the second time I’ve seen a solidly good production of Harley Granville Barker’s Waste and it’s the second time that I just haven’t been blown away by it. Seven years ago saw Samuel West tackle it for the Almeida and now it is Roger Michell’s turn in the Lyttelton as Rufus Norris continues his balancing act of reinvigorating the National Theatre without scaring the regulars off. But spread over a goodly three hours with a pace that could be described as stately at best and glacial at its worst, it’s hard to see Waste converting any newcomers to the joys of theatre. And even with the quality that emanates from the female-centric first scene – Olivia Williams, Sylvestra Le Touzel, Doreen Mantle and Lucy Robinson (forever in my heart as my first Lady Macbeth) doing fine work – the energy is just singularly lacking even as sex, sleaze and suicide pop up on the menu for this slice of the Edwardian political elite.  Hildegard Bechtler’s design is partly culpable, its evocation of elegant loucheness looks a treat but spread across the vast swathe of space of the Lyttelton stage it simply dilutes. The chairs of the opening drawing room scene are set so far apart they may as well be in separate rooms, the length of the table in the parliamentary office is just impractical, seemingly that way just to fill the void. It also doesn’t help that the political machinations of the play, set in a hung parliament where a radical Independent MP is persuaded by the Tories to push through a divisive Bill, aren’t the most gripping."
1175,1175,Ought To Be Clowns,21/12/2009,Ian,Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, Novello,"As for the play itself, it is an updated version relocated into the 1980s according to the show literature, although there were curiously few references to this and I don’t think I would have worked it out had I not been informed of it. It’s a tale of a wealthy landowning family who are struggling to conceal the cracks caused by repressed homosexuality, inheritance struggles, alcoholism and the shadow of terminal illness, and I suppose the one benefit of shifting the timing of the play enables the fact that the cast are all black to be not considered an issue. And it is a strong cast: headed up by James Earl Jones and Phylicia Rashad who originated the roles of the ailing patriarch Big Daddy and his wife Big Mama on Broadway, Rashad showing the quiet dignity of an abused wife, unwilling to accept the impending mortality of her husband. Adrian Lester and Sanaa Lathan were also superb as the warring spouses, struggling to deal with his alcoholism and her sexual frustration, Lathan in particular has a stunning first act in which she is practically delivering an hour long monologue. Excellent support also comes from Nina Sosanya and Peter De Jersey as the other children, hungry for their share of the inheritance. One thing that really surprised me was the audience reaction to James Earl Jones. I found the applauding of his arrival onstage and then his final scene as he left with Big Mama really quite intrusive and offensive to the other actors. I don’t agree with applause upon arrival in any case: they are ac tors and should be rewarded for good acting at the end, not just for turning up, much like Barack Obama’s Nobel Peace Prize, one shouldn’t be granting these things for the potential to deliver. And the fact that it took people about 5 seconds after the curtain rose on Act 2 to realise JEJ was onstage and therefore deliver him a feeble round of applause meant that the scene had already commenced and the other actors were forced to restart, all very bizarre. And whilst some elements of his character were darkly comic, I found the laughter at his misogynistic, barbed comments to his wife quite disturbing. I did really enjoy this play (once we’d moved) and one thing that struck me was the diversity of the audience, quite a rarity in the West End, and I thought to myself ‘well this is a good thing’, but later I questioned that somewhat. This is a universal story, there’s nothing particularly ‘black’ about the issues raised within, yet it takes the casting ‘gimmick’ in order to appeal to this audience. If this really is the case, then it is a shame as truly great acting, hints of which are contained within, is colour-blind. You were that person leaning forward, and thus making every person behind you lean forward in some kind of chain reaction of irritation. Well done. Slow handclap. Never may you complain about that particular annoyance again! 1) You can't slow handclap someone anonymously: own it b*tch.2) You seem like the kind of person who would complain about this kind of thing, but then make someone else actually do something about it, so well done yourself on that achievement.3) Merry Christmas 😉 Can't slow handclap someone anonymously hey?…… that's funny, did you just hear that?"
1176,1176,Ought To Be Clowns,05/02/2018,Ian,Cirque Beserk, Peacock,"In some ways, the classics remain the best. The speed and accuracy with which Toni hurls knives, axes and flaming whatnots at his twirling wife is just gobsmacking; the outrageously flexible Odka’s contortionist work has to be seen to be believed, particularly once she starts using a bow and arrow without her hands; and just nudging into the most impressive position for me, the charismatic Germaine Delbosq’s footjuggling is a marvellous thing indeed, proving without doubt that women can do it all 😉   And a real show-stopping moment comes at the end of each act, with the arrival of the Lucius Team and the Globe of Death. You may not think you need to see not one, not two, not three, but four motorcycles being driven simultaneously around a tiny metal round cage but it is undoubtedly most impressive (and best watched through your fingers – you wonder just how much the guy with a small fire extinguisher on the side could actually do!)  But there is something a little awry in Cirque Beserk. For all the avowed ambition to combine the traditional with the contemporary, its gender politics are seriously dated. One (male) performer has six women wafting around aimlessly during his act as decoration, and the troupe of dancing girls hark back past enlightened times. And a curiously varied soundtrack again maroons in a time too far from today for it have to the contemporary heft it purports to be embracing.  There’s a strong sense of pace about the evening though, from creator director Julius Green, and the pick’n’mix nature of the acts means that if you’re not enjoying something, say the retro clowning antics from Tweedy, it’s not long at all until the next performer rocks up onstage. If you’re looking for some half-term entertainment, this could well be worth a look.  "
1177,1177,Ought To Be Clowns,14/04/2015,mag9l,Lampedusa, Soho Theatre,"There’s something rather ingenious about Lucy Osborne’s design for Anders Lustgarten’s new play Lampedusa. It’s the type of set that invites descriptors like ‘bare’ and ‘minimal’ (cf the Guardian’s reduction of Jan Versweyveld’s Olivier-nominated work to “there is no set”) when you walk into the upstairs space at the Soho Theatre, there appears to be nothing but circular, backless benches on which we must gather around. But even the act of taking a seat becomes charged with something more as the collective gaze of the audience is turned in on each other, even before the play has started. That’s the point that Steven Atkinson’s production skilfully but pointedly makes, and that Osborne’s design in all its ostensible simplicity never lets us forget, that – to coin a phrase – we’re all in this together. As the voices of an Italian coastguard and a Yorkshire payday loan collector speak out from in among us, you realise there but for the grace of God – the people forced to flee persecution or government crackdowns, those who suffer the indignities of derogatory language spat at them or ATOS’ risible assessment procedure, those left with no choice but to make desperate, desperate decisions – it could be us, it is us.  And even if we don’t think it is us, Lustgarten doesn’t let us off the hook that easily as he inserts hope at the centre of all these experiences and place the responsibility for its survival in our hands. In both the cases illustrated here, it is a migrant who cracks open the darkness for our protagonists but the implication is clear – the cumulative power of individual acts of kindness has the potential to change the world and it begins with us, the people in the room whose gazes you glance onto and quickly look away from, the very people on whose random act of kindness you might one day have to rely."
1178,1178,Ought To Be Clowns,08/11/2016,mag9l,Lazarus, King’s Cross,"It’s no secret that I’m a big Ivo van Hove fan, I’ve been to New York and Amsterdam several times to see his work as regular readers will know, so booking for his latest show to hit London – Lazarus – was a no-brainer. At the same time though, I have to say that the music of David Bowie has played little part in my life, so a musical continuing the story of his 1976 film The Man Who Fell To Earth and based on his songs doesn’t actually carry the same appeal that I might normally have with a van Hove show. Of course, the shock news of Bowie’s passing as the show opened in New York this past winter lends Lazarus an especial charge, featuring as it does songs from his later albums and songs that were written for this project, among some of the last he ever penned. To an outsider though, it makes for strange experience with a strong sense of mood prevailing over a defined narrative progression, Enda Walsh co-writing a book with Bowie that is labyrinthine in its own fractured, hallucinatory way. van Hove’s staging, spectacularly designed by regular collaborator Jan Versweyveld, is stunning to look at as it blends in his beloved live video (designed by Tal Yarden) with Tom Cawley’s assured musical direction to give us sequence after sequence which may take place in Thomas Newton’s – that man who fell… – mind or might possibly be taking place in the real world. As played by Michael C Hall, Newton is caught between memories of past love and possibilities of future escape, all meshed with
present-day confusion. Hall guides us through this journey as best he can, exploring Walsh and Bowie’s notions of the power of the imagination with an impassioned and energetic verve. And there’s excellent support throughout the company – original cast members Sophia Anne Caruso’s otherwordly Girl and Michael Esper’s sinister Valentine both shine, with Amy Lennox’s achingly good Elly matching them for intensity and familiar faces like Jamie Muscato and Tom Parsons also delivering good work. If ultimately I found Lazarus aesthetically pleasing rather than fully emotionally engaging, I suspect Bowie fans will find a lot more.  "
1179,1179,Ought To Be Clowns,01/02/2018,Ian,Gypsy Queen, VAULT Festival,"Rob Ward has form when it comes to examining how homophobia is entrenched in the world of sport. His one-man show Away From Home looked at whether the Premiership might ever be ready for an out gay footballer with intelligence and integrity. But it is to the boxing ring that Ward now turns his attention with his play Gypsy Queen, already an award-nominated success after touring the UK and playing Edinburgh last year. Dane ‘The Pain’ Sansom is the son of a boxing legend and a pretty nifty boxer himself, ‘Gorgeous’ George O’Connell is a bare-knuckle champion from the traveller community making his first steps into the world of professional boxing. And when George rocks up at the gym owned by Dane’s dad, sparks soon fly as their respective cockiness rubs up against each other, and sure enough, it isn’t too long before you can remove the -iness from that last bit as they get to know each other better in the shower. For they’re both young gay lads. Life is rarely that simple though, especially in professional sport, particularly in professional sport. Dane is relatively comfortable in his sexuality but defers to his dad’s wish to keep it hidden, George is newly embracing the awakening of his desire but with fiercely traditional ideas about family riven through his community, it’s no surprise that there’s a tragic swerve to events, its inevitability like a weight trying its best to stop these two young men from fulfilling their destiny. Adam Zane’s production keeps a lightness of touch about it though, its feet constantly dancing across the canvas as each performer takes on a variety of supporting roles to flesh out the world around George and Dane, a world that seems like it just can’t let them be. And Ward and co-star John Askew display immense versatility in presenting us with a tender, deeply moving connection between these two young boxers, both from single parent households, as well as the vibrant others in their life. Brutal and funny, sexy and thought-provoking – it’s a good’un. Running time: 70 minutes (without interval)
Booking until 4th February  "
1180,1180,Ought To Be Clowns,07/02/2015,Ian,The Elephant Man, Booth Theatre,"Of all the shows that I saw on Broadway, I really wouldn’t have picked this one to be the one that transfers to the West End. But to the Theatre Royal Haymarket it doth come after a commercially successful run. And oh the irony, casting someone named Sexiest Man Alive as the noted Victorian ‘freak’ Joseph Merrick, aka The Elephant Man. The selling point of Scott Ellis’ production of Bernard Pomerance’s 1977 is most definitely three time Academy Award acting nominee (seriously, how did that happen?!) Bradley Cooper and in the grand tradition of things that Oscar likes, he’s feigning a disability in what I found to be a somewhat disturbing performance. The script determines that no make-up or prosthetic should be used, that Merrick’s deformity should be portrayed only through physicality, and whilst that offers up a veritable challenge to any actor wishing to take on the role, it also throws up big questions that this production comes frustratingly close to interrogating in an interesting way. Putting so fêted and objectified an actor on stage and having society’s reactions in the play range from outright horror to morbid fascination feels like the beginnings of an interesting commentary on today’s obsession with celebrity – indeed, were I directing it I’d’ve had Cooper play no disability at all, to really highlight how we respond to those who are ‘different’. But I’m not a director, as if the point needed making, and so what we get is a physically impressive performance from Cooper (who I actually like as an actor don’t get me wrong, #teamWillTippin4eva) but one which ultimately feels quite hollow as the vehicle for some meandering philosophising on the part of Pomerance as he seeks to expose the hypocrisy at the heart of Victorian society. Even when Merrick makes a connection with another, the actress Mrs Kendal (played by the luminous Patricia Clarkson), a genuine sense of character is still foregone in lieu of heavy-handed moralising, not even her considerable talent can really imbue Mrs Kendal with any kind of realism."
1181,1181,Ought To Be Clowns,10/10/2017,Ian,Graeme of Thrones, Charing Cross,"If you haven’t seen an episode of Game of Thrones, I’m not entirely why you would want to come and see a show that spoofs it lovingly if relentlessly. The blurb for Graeme of Thrones mentions it could be seen as “an introduction for the unenlightened” but let’s be frank, to expect a rapid-fire comedy show to catch you up on seven seasons of intricately plotted fantasy drama and enable you to get such puns as the one above is to make you as naive as, well, Ned Stark. But for the initiated, there’s lots to enjoy in this madcap which rattle through an inordinate amount of material in its 90 minutes and still barely scratches the surface of the Seven Kingdoms. From its hilarious re-enactment of the opening credits to the arrival of actual dragons*, John-Luke Roberts, Nicola Lamont and Ross Spaine work overtime to take us from Westeros to Essos and back and cover as much of the plot as they can shoehorn in, along with jokes at many of the tropes it fully embraces. And a fair amount of it is properly funny. The introduction of the Stark children (poor Rickon!), the shifts in perspective needed to bring Bran’s fall to life or to convince us of Tyrion’s height, Daenerys and Khal Drogo’s predilection for love duets… And when they really cut loose, it is hilarious, as in channeling the Lord of Light via some Berlin gay fetish dungeon, giving us a tableau vivant from the viewpoint of the boar that killed Robert Baratheon, and Sansa’s vivid journey to womenhood. As with much comedy, there’s a variable hit-rate though, as here that mainly comes through the framing device of a theatre company pitching this show to potential investors, unable to keep their personal lives from bleeding through into the action. As necessary as these breaks are, to allow the performers a little breathing space and time to change costumes, the notion of Lloyd Webber or an HBO lawyer being in the audience is just not as funny as the amount of time it is given here."
1182,1182,Ought To Be Clowns,18/01/2015,Ian,Little Shop of Horrors, Royal Exchange,"There are shows I love and then there are shows I LOVE and Little Shop of Horrors most definitely falls into that latter category. I fell for its undeniable charms when I was 11 or 12 I think, when my mum was involved in her school production of it, letting me wander backstage, and the MD, who was also my piano teacher, snuck out a copy of Alan Menken’s most tuneful of scores to enliven my lessons for a good few weeks. Combined with the cult classic that is the movie version, I was utterly hooked and have remained so ever since. So I was most delighted to see the Royal Exchange announcing it as their festive fare and with the ever-exciting Derek Bond directing, who in recent years has delivered a bewitching As You Like It, the hugely under-rated Many Moons and Lost in Yonkers, through which I cried pretty much non-stop. The gloriously rich vocal harmonies of Ibinabo Jack, Ellena Vincent and Joelle Moses as Chiffon, Crystal and Ronnette, the girl-group Greek chorus who doo-wop their premonitions of doom, are an ever-present and magnificent hook into the action and never more so than in the stellar one-two that opens the show. ‘Little Shop of Horrors’ is a stone-cold classic theme tune with its shang-a-langs and throaty comma comma commas but ‘Skid Row’ – one of my all-time favourite songs from a musical, I should add – blooms into resplendent life, benefitting from a slightly slowed tempo and some sympatico choreography to really nail the air of quiet desperation that lies at the song’s heart as we’re introduced to this classic “boy-meets-girl-feeds-plant-her-boyfriend-gets-famous-kills-boss-sacrifices-girl-and-dies” story. Oh yeah, spoiler alert 😉 MD Tim Jackson (also responsible for the moves) has really played a blinder here, his five-strong band delivering interesting arrangements throughout which capture the interest of both those familiar with the score and newcomers too. And James Perkins’ set design meets the needs of the in-the-round space perfectly, his uncluttered aesthetic allowing the focus to fall squarely on Toby Olié’s puppetry which brings Audrey II to increasingly dramatic life. Voiced and manipulated by Nuno Silva, and then later aided by James Charlton and CJ Johnson (all refugees from the wonder that was The Light Princess), it is an evocative and exhilarating rendering that is hypnotically compelling and like all great divas, knows just how to work an exit. Elsewhere, director Bond pitches it just right across the board. The unsavoury nature of Audrey’s relationship with abusive dentist Orin Scrivello isn’t shirked, and acknowledged by the verbal dressing-down he gets from the girls, but it is equally isn’t too graphic – this is the Royal Exchange’s family show after all – and Ako Mitchell captures an ideal level of gleeful sadism. He’s also helped by his doubling of a whole suite of supporting characters, each and every one of whom is a minor comic success (his interested customer probably won for me)."
1183,1183,Ought To Be Clowns,20/05/2014,mag9l,Things We Do For Love, Richmond Theatre,"And so once again I find myself drawn to the theatre to see an Alan Ayckbourn play despite the fact I know it is most likely to be a big mistake. The assembly of a good cast is something I’ve always found hard to resist – in this case it was the glorious Claire Price and Ed Bennett, plus the slightly left of the middle choice of Natalie Imbruglia, making her stage debut here. Plus there was the general assertion that the near-twenty year old Things We Do For Love is ostensibly one of his better plays, though on this evidence I don’t quite know why and thus I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong impression, this play left me far from satisfied. Starting today at Richmond Theatre after a tour that has taken in many a UK city, Laurence Boswell’s Theatre Royal Bath production is certainly handsomely mounted in Giles Cadle’s perfectly designed set which reflects the demands of one of Ayckbourn’s rare forays into specifically end-on work. Set in the Fulham home of frustrated career woman Barbara which has been partitioned into three flats, we see the entirety of her middle floor home but only a couple of feet into those of her tenants – creepy handyman Gilbert below and old school friend, and new affiancéed, Nikki. It’s a tricksy device which sometimes works, as in capturing the philanderings of Gilbert as he works on something shocking on his ceiling and less well as the shenanigans from upstairs are represented solely from the knee down or in the case of some ungainly wrangling, from an awkward position on the bed. All the while, Barbara’s ‘spinsterish sanctuary’ (the interview in the programme about this very subject has to be seen to be believed) is shattered as the repressed but reciprocated feelings for her friend’s fiancé Hamish see them diving in the deep end into a passionate affair.  It is hard not to be impressed by as good a quality cast as this, especially as they layer in more depth into the characters than Ayckbourn’s simplistic, sitcom-ish writing allows. Price in particular has to work extremely hard to make Barbara anything more than a humourless harridan and in all honesty, deserves something better than this play, it’s hard to identify what actors see in roles like this. But as she surrenders to her feelings for Ed Bennett’s charismatic Hamish (making his own entry into lookatmyfuckingredtrousers) with their flirting up against the wall, it almost becomes fun. Almost. For because this is one of Ayckbourn’s darker works, it is landed with huge contradictions as their lustful passion turns violent and this violence is played purely for laughs, something that sits a little strangely on a modern stage with the spectre of domestic violence uncomfortably close for my liking. And as everything goes up in smoke and the emotional hurricane burns out, the emotional scars are left mainly with Imbruglia’s Nikki, a previously thankless role which finally comes into its own as she surveys the wreckage that has been made of her life like a frightened child. By contrast, Simon Gregor’s Gilbert is one of those comic creations that you will either love or hate and though the vast majority of those around me were loving him (do you love people falling through doors and struggling to walk through doors etc, if so you’re in luck) his drunken acting proved to be painful beyond belief. Gilbert is a horribly conceived role though, his position as a satellite to the main characters, a figure of fun for the three yuppies, and by extension us the audience, speaks to the worst kind of shiver-inducing middle class smugness and simply reiterates the way in which Ayckbourn’s writing often ages difficultly."
1184,1184,Ought To Be Clowns,05/06/2011,Ian,Lend Me A Tenor, Gielgud,"For the second time in three days, I deliberately went to a show knowing nothing about it in advance, and I would evidently seem to have used up much of my theatrical karma as for the second time, I was subjected to farce! But ever the contrarian, musical comedy Lend Me A Tenor hit the spot for me with a highly entertaining production where Rumours at the Hen + Chickens did not (although they are completely different beasts in the end). A relatively new musical, written by Peter Sham and Brad Carroll and based on the 1986 play of the same name by Ken Ludwig, the show had a short run in Plymouth last autumn and transfers now to the Gielgud in the West End where it is now previewing following the untimely departure of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Several of the cast members have made the move with the show but in a neat twist of continuity, Joanna Riding has joined the ensemble here meaning she will continue to perform in the same theatre. Set in 1934, the Cleveland, Ohio Grand Opera Company is struggling to survive and manager Henry Saunders is banking everything on their new production of Otello featuring leading Italian opera star and notorious womaniser Tito Minelli. But when a set of circumstances conspire to leave Tito unable to perform, shy assistant Max – who harbours his own dreams of performing – has to find a last minute replacement to play the title role. Things are not quite so simple though, this is a farce after all, as there’s a jealous Italian wife, conniving co-stars, a trio of ex-wives, a randy daughter, three version of the same costume, oh, and the President is coming to watch. And it is all really rather good fun. It is a played as a period piece but Brad Carroll’s score borrows liberally from a wide range of influences to pleasingly tuneful and comedic effect. So we get proper old-school Broadway songs complete with delightful choreography from Randy Skinner, Lloyd-Webber-esque balladry with a stunning male duet and plenty of nods to the operatic canon with a delightful song that whips through a huge number of operas in a short space of time. Director Ian Talbot also draws on a broad canvas, working in silent movie and foreign language film gags and milking the opera scenes for all they are worth too, before tumbling headlong into the out-and-out farce of the second act as the mistaken identity plot slides into top gear. This broad array of stylistic influences necessitates a cast with a vast range of experience and expertise and in some respect, this is both the show’s main strength and its weakness. Joanna Riding’s passionate wife is fabulous but something of a cameo role: her Act I songs, the duet ‘Facciamo L’Amor’ and then ‘The Last Time’ are two of the show’s highlights but then she’s off for most the rest of the show; conversely Sophie-Louise Dann’s scheming soprano, whose ‘May Have I A Moment’ is a real tour-de-force, emerges as a major character but only in the second act; Cassidy Janson’s Maggie is likewise stunning but not given enough opportunity to shine. For a show that ends up with six main characters, there is a surprising dearth of songs in the second act to really give this musical the swing it needs to reach the final act. I also think it is a shame that the rather uninspired title song is the one chosen to be reprised at the end when there’s livelier songs. But what is perhaps lost on the musical side, is recompensed with some brilliant comedy with countless absurd touches including a rather non-pc sight gag which is still making me chuckle today. Matthew Kelly, Michael Matus and Damian Humbley are particularly strong here, showing some incredibly well-executed timing (especially for a preview). Humbley’s vocal performance as the backroom guy turned opera star is excellently done too, though Matus’ bombastic Signor Morelli probably edged it for me with the guys. Peter Sham’s book is mostly strong throughout, though a fair few jokes flew by unremarked, not all of which can be ascribed to the preview period. Looking back, the show it puts me most in mind of is probably The Drowsy Chaperone. Lend Me A Tenor doesn’t wear its postmodernist tendencies quite so obviously and makes more of a virtue of its old-fashioned sense of humour. And as with so many absurd comedies of this nature, one has to be willing to enter into the suspension of disbelief that allows some of the more ridiculous moments to pass by unchallenged, to pick holes in this is to miss the point completely. I do hope though that this doesn’t suffer the same fate as The Drowsy Chaperone of not being able to connect with a wider audience, the Gielgud’s position on Shaftesbury Avenue should help somewhat as should the word of mouth to raise awareness about the show itself which had been previously a little under the radar. For Lend Me A Tenor does have a lot going for it, not least Paul Farnsworth’s set design which has to rank as amongst one of the most elegant and impressive in London at the moment (it has allegedly used up all the gold leaf in the country!) and a wonderful cast who all seize their moments to shine in a varied and interesting musical which has to be seen just so you can hear how funny the quote as the top of the review is when spoken out loud in an Italian accent (honest). If nothing else, how could you resist this rarest of beasts, a farce that actually made me laugh!"
1185,1185,Ought To Be Clowns,09/11/2014,Ian,West End Recast 2, Phoenix,"There’s always gotta be a sequel right? After the success of West End Recast earlier this year, director Adam Lenson and musical supervisor Daniel A Weiss have once again gathered a cast of West End talent with nothing better to do on a Sunday night than perform songs they wouldn’t normally get the chance to sing. And once again, they hit the jackpot with West End Recast 2, an extraordinary range of performers and performances that offer a revelatory take on what places musical theatre could go to when a few risks are taken. Imagine Cynthia Erivo as Bobby in Company, her rendition of ‘Being Alive’ was genuinely sensational (although nothing will ever convince me that a mid-song standing ovation is acceptable) and somehow found something new in this classic that literally raised the roof. So too did Gina Beck utterly own West Side Story’s ‘Maria’, an unexpectedly affecting take that also deserves to be explored more, not least as a fascinating challenge for her vocal range. Cassidy Janson deserves a mention for going green again, though this time as Shrek rather than Elphaba, well for the most part at least… Nick Holder giving Imelda Staunton a run for her money (well, not really, but he gives it a damn good try) by seizing ‘Rose’s Turn’ by the balls; Jon Robyns remixing Rent far better than Rent Remixed ever achieved with a beautiful take on ‘Out Tonight’; David Bedella relishing the dip into a Desmond with ‘With One Look’; the boys more than represented too. Fra Free taking on Ragtime’s Your Daddy’s Son was another success, offering insight into what a talented singer he is turning out to be. There was humour too in the evening, in the lighter touches of Julie Atherton’s sozzled take on Matilda’s ‘Naughty’ seguing cleverly into Annette McLoughlin’s Les Mis number.

1186,1186,Ought To Be Clowns,31/07/2011,Ian,Singin’ in the Rain, Chichester Festival Theatre,"I’m often asked what my favourite genre of theatre is and I usually make vague noises about liking all of it (farce and puppetry aside obviously) but there is no denying that the shows I truly love the most are big old-school musicals stuffed full of show-tunes and tap-dancing: sheer escapism wrapped up in cosy familiarity. I’m not entirely sure where this came from as these weren’t the shows (or films) of my childhood but this is turn has brought its own pleasures as I’ve been able to see shows like Hello, Dolly!, Salad Days and On the Town for the first time in amazing stage productions without knowing what to expect and consequently being blown away. Earlier this year, the Crucible’s Me and My Girl planted a strong marker for musical of the year but having now seen Singin’ in the Rain at the Chichester Festival Theatre, the competition is definitely hotting up. There are similarities: the open thrust stage here, as in Sheffield, is just perfect for big expansive dance numbers, especially when they are this well-choreographed, and also able to play on an intimacy with the audience that most London theatres would kill for; and Daniel Crossley is in both, he may be in a supporting role here but to my mind, he is one of our best all-rounders, I could watch him dance for days; and they’re both ‘out-of-town’ shows, I’m not sure how much of a difference it really makes, but it is hard to shake the feeling that had they originated in London, they’d be less ensemble-oriented, less fun and more cynically post-modern. Dodgy attempt at analysis aside, this production of Singin’ in the Rain is seriously about as much fun as I’ve had in the theatre in ages. All aspects of the production are great but Andrew Wright’s choreography is a thing of true delight. Routine after routine is filled with invention, wit and just beautiful, beautiful images, whether the daydreamy duet, the big Broadway Ballet, the big number with all the girls dancing on an aeroplane, the ebullience of the three leads skipping through Good Mornin’, the boys having their fun in the goofy Moses or the absolute delight of the title track, complete with considerable amounts of water! Everyone delivers it perfectly, but more importantly, looks like they’re having the time of their lives: this is the type of show that truly makes you want to investigate dance lessons. The story, for those who do not know, revolves around the arrival of the talkies in 1920s Hollywood. Queen of the silent screen Lina Lamont’s dominance, alongside screen partner Don Lockwood, is threatened as she has a screechy Brooklyn accent that she can’t shake and she soon finds herself being dubbed by her enemy Kathy Selden, who just happens to also be head over heels for Lockwood who falls for her too, as they all battle to save their careers with the help of Don’s ingenious best friend Cosmo. The show is just full of spectacular energy, even when they are not dancing, and crucially there’s lots of humour – the film clips of the silent movie “The Dueling Cavalier” are worthy of a Victoria Wood show as is the test run of the first talkie – I really wasn’t expect to laugh quite so much. More often than not, I find myself drawn to supporting characters rather than the leads, they always get to be more interesting! (see Eponine over Cosette, Anita over Maria etc) And so it was here with Katherine Kingsley as the squeaky-voiced Lina whose career is most threatened by the impending dawn of the new age. She is huge amounts of fun as the dumb blonde, ostensibly a schemer but not quite malicious and combined with her impeccable comic timing, she is simply irresistible: the word ‘can’t’ will rarely have made people laugh so. But Scarlett Strallen does extremely well to inject enchanting personality into Kathy without making her too wholesome and annoying and she sings and dances like a dream. Likewise with the boys, Adam Cooper’s easy elegance in any dance routine makes him highly effective and quietly charismatic, blending well with Strallen. But I was always drawn to Daniel Crossley as his best friend Cosmo, blessed with lots of sharp one-liners, pratfall-filled humour ( plus a stronger singing voice than Cooper dare I say it) and exuding the kind of ebullient enthusiasm that demands the eyes on him. But there’s something delicious about the strength of this foursome, something remarkably unselfish and this extends to a talented ensemble who are given much to do with countless small parts but delivering polish from start to finish: if I had to pick favourites, Ebony Molina’s dancing is just fabulous and Brendan Cull has a charm about him that makes me want to see more of him. I feel like I could write for days about how I loved this show, and I am seriously considering making a return visit. Rumours abound that it might transfer into the Palace Theatre, but then there was talk of Me and My Girl making it down to London and that never happened, plus whilst the opportunity to see it in its original staging still exists, I couldn’t recommend it more. I watch shows like this, my spirit rises and I smile for days afterwards at the merest memory of it, and I really do wonder how could anyone profess to not like musicals!"
1187,1187,Ought To Be Clowns,22/11/2015,mag9l,Een Bruid in de Morgen, Toneelschuur Haarlem,"Though considered one of the most important contemporary Belgian writers, Hugo Claus’s renown hasn’t stretched much outside of the Flemish-speaking world. So it is perhaps fitting that I saw Toneelgroep Amsterdam’s production of his Een Bruid in de Morgen (A Bride in the Morning) at the Toneelschuur theatre in Haarlem in its native language, without the English surtitles that are so usefully provided on Thursdays at their main base in the Dutch capital. I was well up for the challenge though, not least because the show fell under the auspices of their emerging directors programme TA-2 – nurturing the Ivo van Hoves of the future – and through which I saw Julie Van den Burgh’s extraordinary reinterpretation of Blood Wedding back in 2013. This time round, it is Norwegian Maren E Bjørseth getting the opportunity to work with the ensemble company, taking the show around the Netherlands. It was a fascinating experience, seeing a show I didn’t know in a language I don’t speak. I read a brief synopsis beforehand but left it at that, otherwise happy to submerge myself in Bjørseth’s theatrical world and let it wash over me. And it’s a mark of the quality of the work that so much was crystal-clear from the outset. The billowing fabric of Marjolijn Brouwer’s marquee-like design suggesting the uncertain state of the Pattini family’s foundations, Lotte Goos’ costumes amplifying character oddities, Bernie van Velzen’s inquisitive lighting proving the difficulty in keeping secrets. There are big secrets too. Brother and sister Thomas and Andrea have retreated into an almost childlike state of being in their imagination, their emotions intricately entwined, almost dangerously so in their closeness whereas parents Fred and Madeleine are lost in their own reveries. More pragmatically minded, they espy the opportunity in the arrival of rich cousin Hilda to marry Thomas off to her but her presence does more than upset the carefully calibrated balance in the household, it throws it catastrophically off. I’ve loved getting to know the TGA ensemble better and knowing Fred Goessens and Marieke Heebink was a big selling point, their broad humour hugely enjoyable to watch, deepening into real tragicomedy towards the end. Alwin Pulinckx and Jip Smith both offered huge emotional openness as the quasi-incestuous siblings in all their damaged innocence, and Camilla Siegertsz mined a rich vein of exaggerated physical comedy as Hilda, transforming her from comical grotesque to a figure of real power and ambition. A most enjoyable way to shift the theatrical experience into something new. "
1188,1188,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,The Theatre Channel – Episode Two,,"After a highly successful debut, Episode 2 of The Theatre Channel arrives and things have gone a bit Strictly with a theme week. Natch it is Hallowe’en that acts as a linking thread between the performances here but unlike Strictly, it is pleasingly effective as the production design (by Gregor Donnelly) gets to play with a more cohesive visual language across the show (credit too to director Bill Deamer and DP Ben Hewis), and the song selection gets to go a bit dark and dramatic. That’s not to say that there’s not a variety of tone here. As befits this holiday, there’s a healthy dose of camp as a CGI-enhanced Ria Jones casts her spell over Into the Woods’ ‘Last Midnight’ and the camp drama of Frank Wildhorn’s ‘Life After Life’ from Dracula the Musical is well served by the relatively straight bat and sensational voices of Bradley Jaden and Sophie Isaacs. The same goes for Josh Piterman’s dangerously seductive take on ‘The Confrontation’ from Jekyll and Hyde.  There’s out-and-out froofery from the highly appealing Jordan Shaw with a skip through ‘Transylvania Mania’ from Young Frankenstein, further enlivened by a tap break and some indecent hip thrusts. And also with the pelvis, Trevor Dion Nicholas’ ‘The Time Warp’ – with super special guest! – is the customary riotious ball of fun it should be – both these numbers ably assisted by the talented Café Four ensemble of Alyn Hawke, Emily Langham, Sadie-Jean Shirley and Alex Woodward and Diana Hudson’s excellent hair and make-up."
1189,1189,Ought To Be Clowns,17/08/2014,Ian,The Picture of John Gray, Old Red Lion,"Though Wilde is oft mentioned, he never actually appears here, his presence is merely felt and as Patrick Walshe McBride’s youthful Gray burns brightly and briefly in Oscar’s life, he spends more and more time in The Vale, the artist’s studio of couple Charles Ricketts and Charles Shannon that formed the salon for the group. There, his head is turned by the French Jewish literary critic Marc-André Raffalovich and an intense relationship forms between the two, right at the moment that the Bosie-led scandal explodes and lands Wilde in court and then in jail. McBride manages to convey the duality of Gray’s nature beautifully, as his unmistakeable passion for the Frenchman comes up hard against his increasingly devout Catholicism, and he is more than matched by Christopher Tester’s aching emotional eloquence as Raffalovich, their Berlin-set scene is one of the most quietly devastating of the year. There’s strong supporting work from Oliver Allan and Jordan McCurrach as the Charleses who espy the danger of homosexual indiscretion and do their best to protect their friends, even as their own position in society becomes threatened."
1190,1190,Ought To Be Clowns,13/10/2019,Ian,The House of Yes, Hope Theatre,"For his final show as a director, outgoing AD of the Hope Theatre Matthew Parker (interview here) has turned once again to the ever-so-slightly macabre, in reviving Wendy MacLeod’s 1990 The House of Yes. And in a rather pleasing note, a host of familiar faces can be spotted in the cast – Bart Lambert (Thrill Me), Fergus Leathem (Brimstone and Treacle), Colette Eaton (Her Aching Heart) are joined by Gill King and Kaya Bucholc to take a step way onto the dark side. The Pascals live in Washington DC but though it is 20 years since JFK’s assassination, the shadow of the Kennedys looms large over this clan. And over a hurricane-swept Thanksgiving, twin siblings Marty and Jackie-O are set to be reunited, though as he’s bringing a new fiancée Lesly and she’s got a pills-addled mother and horny younger brother in tow, it is clear this ain’t going to be your average family gathering. 
There’s an almost Grand Giugnol darkness at play here, as blood-curdling screams sit alongside machiavellian mindgames. And the way in which the family circles around newcomer/interloper Lesly is genuinely chilling, Bucholc nailing her scarcely believing incredulity while Eaton and Leathem work a wickedly fun Flowers in the Attic aesthetic, even as he ostensibly tries to pull away to something close to normalcy. Dark and twisted has nothing on this lot."
1191,1191,Ought To Be Clowns,12/06/2018,Ian,Shakespeare’s Mad Women – A Love Letter to Shakespearean F?!kboys, TheatreN16,"Lady Macbeth, Ophelia and Juliet walk into a bar…it sounds like the set-up for a great joke. Swap out the bar for an amorphous corner of the afterlife and you get the set-up for the delightfully titled debut production from Lady Garden Theatre, Shakespeare’s Mad Women – A Love Letter to Shakespearean F?!kboys, taking a short run at TheatreN16 after playing the Brighton Fringe last month. This is the bit of the afterlife where Shakespeare’s female characters end up, specifically the ones who take their lives because of a man, and heaven knows there’s a lot of them. Juliet is the latest to join the group and when she arrives, she is naturally thoroughly discombobulated: instead of finding her Romeo with arms open wide, there’s two strange women drinking tea.  Written and directed by Abigail Smith, Shakespeare’s Mad Women is such a brilliantly simple concept, you can’t wonder why it’s not been done before. One might suggest a reason being because of Shakespeare’s unchallenged position at the head of the canon, or maybe the conniptions that seize hold of commentators at the mere mention of gender-blind casting. But even mighty oaks benefit from the occasional thorough shakedown. So here, Holly Cuffley’s wearied Lady M and Gabrielle Pausey’s Ophelia guide Gala Wesson’s Juliet through what they’ve gleaned about their situation. And as painful flashbacks intermittently pull them back into snatches of verse from their past, evocative movement hints at the dreamlike state of being caught in such a limbo. And all three convince with their movingly different stages of acceptance. "
1192,1192,Ought To Be Clowns,06/12/2013,Ian,Puss in Boots, Hackney Empire,"Though its position at other times of the year may seem a little precarious, Susie McKenna has built up the Hackney Empire into one of the must-see venues for pantomime in London, drawing in families from far and wide to their revitalised yet still classic take on all the old favourites. This year is the turn of Puss in Boots to get the E8 treatment but as Kat B takes to the stage drawling through a heavy Jamaican accent and exhorting us to call out ‘Puss in Boots dem’, it is soon clear that this lesser known panto has had a little tinkering. So whilst we do have a young miller’s son Thomas, who is cheated out of his inheritance and left with just his faithful feline who finds his way into a magic shoeshop, there’s also the various members of the royal household of the kingdom of Hackneyonia to get to know, as an evil queen has taken advantage of a missing prince. Along with a good fairy and an evil witch both trying to get their way. Plus a surprisingly effective ogre. So it can be a little perplexing to work out exactly what is going on, especially when there’s two separate villains to boo and for a title character, Puss doesn’t actually have a huge amount to do. The performance level is sensational though, the entire cast fully engaged with the task of entertaining (and at this performance, expertly negotiating the demands of a primary school-heavy audience too young for most of the humour). Sharon D Clarke’s Queen Talulah is a bootylicious delight, whether belting out ‘The Show Must Go On’ or an Adele medley; Amy Lennox is huge fun as her spoilt brat of a daughter, the precious Pertunia; and Josefina Gabrielle is scene-stealingly good as the under-utilised evil witch Evilena. Although liberally sprinkled with contemporary references (“she thinks she’s in Game of Thrones”; “it’s like an episode of Chicken Shop”) and local colour (Thomas pretends to be the Marquess of Peck-n-n-ham), McKenna’s script also relies heavily on a hackneyed sense of humour. First-time dame Stephen Matthews works his way through pages of jokes without ever really catching fire and (one poor soul called Matt aside) there could be more specific audience interaction to really involve us all in his scenes."
1193,1193,Ought To Be Clowns,22/11/2013,Ian,From Morning to Midnight, National Theatre,"Sometimes, one knows from the first moments of a show that it just isn’t going to be your cup of tea. And so it was with the opening montage of Melly Still’s new production of From Morning to Midnight, a landmark of German expressionism apparently but for me, a hugely ambitious piece of stagecraft that indulges far too much overt theatricality at the expense of dramatic integrity. It is worth noting ‘twas a preview that I saw and one in which understudy Jack Tarlton had to step in for the injured Adam Godley in the lead role. Georg Kaiser’s 1912 play uses an episodic form to tell the story of an everyday clerk who is jolted from the mundaneness of his existence when a sultry Italian wanders into his bank, inspiring him to seize the day and make a change to his dull family life. That he does by stealing 60,000 marks from the bank with the intention of eloping with this woman but when she rejects him, the clerk delves into a journey of the soul – both actual and metaphysical – that lasts for a day but feels like a lifetime. Part of the problem lies in Dennis Kelly’s translation, a writer whom I’ve had issues with in the past, and so it proves again as he flattens out the clerk’s experiences to a crushingly bland level, failing to anchor him in any real sense so that there’s an appreciation of the psychological torment that underlies the constant shifts between reality and fantasy. Instead there’s a slipperiness which never allows the audience to gain any purchase, to assess the institutions against which he, and assumably Kaiser in his original, railed in the pursuit of genuine individual freedom. But Still’s production also feels flawed, full of set pieces that sprawl over the Lyttelton’s stage yet feel over-inflated as far as the directorial vision goes. As an example, all the business with money is mimed, with the ensemble doing foley work on the side, yet most of the transactions are obscured by the design of the bank teller’s set – so much feels like it would be better in a much more intimate space. Instead, sheets are swirled, huge videos are projected, things are hoisted and a revolve spins merrily away, all providing spectacle (of sorts) but none demonstrating necessity. "
1194,1194,Ought To Be Clowns,18/02/2019,Ian,The D Word, VAULT Festival,"There’s something a bit awkward about reading that a play is deeply autobiographical after not having really believed it. So I should probably apologise in advance to Jordan Waller. His story certainly is remarkable – a gay man born of lesbian parents via sperm donation – exploring notions of identity and self when your upbringing is far from conventional. So why did The D Word leave me cold. I think it was something to do with the tone of the show, caught somewhere between comedy routine and confessional. A brusque vein of brutally smutty humour runs throughout the hour (weirdly focused on Bible-bashing jokes at one point) that keeps the audience somewhat at arm’s length rather than embracing us fully into his story. Tales of being outed by his birth mum at 11 raise a chuckle but his growing emotional distance from his other mum Dawn once their relationship ends is left unexplored."
1195,1195,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2020,Ian,Memoirs of an Asian Football Casual, Curve Leicester,"Just a quickie for this, a show from Curve Leicester which is being streamed for the next week. Memoirs of an Asian Football Casual is an interpretation of Riaz Khan’s book about his experience as a football hooligan in the 1980s which adaptor Dougal Irvine and director Nikolai Foster have reworked into a two-hander which bursts off the stage with enough energy to reach your screen. Hareet Deol and Jay Varsani play brothers Riaz and Suf who, in their search for a sense of belonging, wind up in the tight-knit community of Leicester City’s Baby Squad, a multicultural gang who more than squared up to the threat of far-right racism. And as they also take on the tens of other roles in the story with lightning quick precision, there’s a powerful tale of a particular shade of British masculinity that has shaped so much of the attitudes that still prevail in dark corners today. It’s well worth the watch over the coming weeks."
1196,1196,Ought To Be Clowns,06/02/2011,Ian,Water, Filter at Tricycle Theatre,"First seen at the Lyric Hammersmith in 2007, Filter and David Farr’s collaborative effort Water has been revived and is playing for a month at the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn. Water pulls together two main stories, the first featuring a pair of half-brothers struggling to deal with the legacy of their deceased father, an early proponent of climate change theory, and their different perceptions of him before and after he accepted corporate money to silence his views, and the second about a young political adviser trying to push through a binding climate change agreement at a major international summit in the face of her own splintering relationship with her deep cave diving boyfriend. And the show really is about these human dramas rather than environmental issues per se, the connection to water that they all have is incidental rather than integral. Using their trademark style of laying much of the theatrical process bare, the three actors, sound technician and stage team ‘create’ in front of us and with this deceptively simple approach, moments of stark beauty are achieved: the silhouetted squash game and the striking, wordless penultimate scene being two particular standouts. The way in the soundscape is created by everyone in the most varied of manners and then further developed by Tim Phillips is brilliantly executed, finding connections in the most disparate of things. Ferdy Roberts, Oliver Dimsdale and Victoria Moseley cover all the roles between them, Roberts standing out as the incredibly socially awkward Graham, also playing his professor father with a nice warmth; Moseley’s career-driven woman was also particularly well-realised and extremely believable in the way her private dilemmas slowly but surely encroached on her professional life. Dimsdale had a tougher job with his roles as the more self-assured half-brother and the thrill-seeking boyfriend, both comparatively subsidiary parts to the above-mentioned leads and subsequently less developed in the play. Taken in and of itself though, I couldn’t help but feel that Water was a little underwhelming. For all its inventiveness and the passion of the team involved, the stories that are told here don’t feel particularly revelatory or substantial enough to be considered essential. That said, plays rarely exist in a vacuum and given my somewhat reduced expectation level on two different fronts, it actually emerged as a pleasant enough experience for me. Filter is a company I admire, though I’ve yet to have an experience with them that really works for me: I wasn’t a fan (though it often feels like I’m one of the only ones) of their Twelfth Night, yes it is highly amusing and energetic and the company have a great time but in terms of a story-telling exercise I found it surprisingly weak and likewise I wasn’t a fan of their Three Sisters, a fairly pedestrian production featuring some (but not enough) experimental (but annoying) sound design which did little to enhance matters. But Water seemed to rein in the excesses of these shows and demonstrate a less hectic and more focused approach which worked better for me. The second point that had me a little concerned was the (perceived) subject matter. Theatre focused on green issues is very much du jour: the Royal Court’s The Heretic lies in wait for me in a week’s time but the National’s experiment that was Greenland which failed to surmount its multi-author, multi-strand format did not augur well for this show, but by keeping the story count down to two, it was able to achieve a greater sense of focus and therefore emotional connection. However, it does seem that there is something of a paucity of ideas in shows around this area with the same archetypes popping up: the scientist paid off by the establishment emerged again in Earthquakes in London, the frustrated woman at a climate change conference was a key part of Greenland. For a topic that is so current and also very popular with playwrights at the moment, it does not seem to be encouraging enough original thinking which is reflected I think in the weariness of audiences (Greenland was struggling to sell tickets even before the notices), a depressing notion given how serious an issue it is. So in an oughttobeclowns nutshell, if you didn’t like Greenland and are not quite convinced about Filter, you will probably quite like this: I’m really not sure what the rest of the world will think though. It was well received on this Saturday night, it does features some stunning sound design, engaging character work and is swiftly over in 90 minutes, I couldn’t help but long for, well, some more sophisticated drama. Hi Ian! I think this is a very fair assessment of the evening. I thought it was fab, personally (review will go up soon). But *nothing* to do with climate change. I wonder whether they felt they should just jump on the current theatrical bandwagon to help ticket sales? If you forget about climate change I think it's a great piece of devised theatre."
1197,1197,Ought To Be Clowns,06/07/2011,Ian,Cymbeline, Tabard Theatre,"Cymbeline is one of Shakespeare’s later plays, occupying an uneasy middle ground between tragedy, romance, comedy with a loose smattering of history thrown in for good measure and thus garnering the reputation as one of his problem plays. New London-based theatre company Avanti have taken up the challenge with their 1970s re-imagining though which is currently playing at the Tabard Theatre in West London. It’s essentially a romance, with tragic overtones, focusing on Imogen, a princess of Britain who has secretly married her lowly childhood friend Posthumus, frustrating the plans of her wicked (step)mother. Upon finding out, her father King Cymbeline banishes him from the kingdom, and thus a whole merry load of confusions start. Posthumus is tricked into believing Imogen has been unfaithful and orders her murder, Imogen is forewarned and dispatched to Wales in the guise of a boy, there she meets two random boys who turn out to have a very strong connection to her, more betrayals and murder ensue, there’s a bit of a war, the god Jupiter pops down for a chat and then there’s an incredibly neat, yet interminably long ending in which every single plot strand is recapped and then resolved. Perhaps it is not the most considered of opinions but it is all a bit bonkers really, incorporating so many Shakespearean devices that are familiar to us from other plays – cross-dessing princesses, potions that feign death, long-lost children, wagers about virtue – and folding them all into the one huge narrative, but matters aren’t necessarily helped by some of the creative decisions. It is set in a loose version of the 70s, all flares and flowery shirts, and in large part this is surprisingly effective: Posthumus’ defiance of society’s norm, Imogen’s rebellion against the convention’s of her parents’ generation, the singing of the young princes over a dead body feels a heartbeat away from Godspell, but these all fit well with the concept. It is less successful later on though when history kicks in as Rome invades Britain, some vaguely fascist-looking uniforms appearing lending a slightly surreal air. The casting of veteran Ian Barritt as Cymbeline brings a certain gravitas and beautiful verse-speaking to the company but it casts the centre of gravity considerably askew given that he is probably twice the age of anyone else in the cast though the age range of characters is quite wide. For a company aspiring to give “the next generation” the opportunity to entertain, it seems an odd inclusion though he gives a strong performance as the cantankerous but kindly Cymbeline. And double-casting Spike Laurie as Posthumus and his rival Cloten also fell into the category of odd: it took me a while to figure it out to be honest and he has to work so hard, especially in the first half, constantly running into scenes buttoning up his change of shirt, all for a payoff in the second act that isn’t really worth i The youthful, if uneven, company do give it their all with a mixed bag of performances. Laurie is particularly strong as an appealing Posthumus, Rhys Jennings makes for a worldly, compassionate Belarius and Rhiannon Neads showed promise in a number of smaller supporting roles and Alex Critoph finds a quiet strength as Imogen too. But the structure of the play leaves some of the weaker performers more exposed, especially in the lengthy final scene, where the tone wavers dangerously close to farce at the expense of true emotional impact. Overall, the uncertainty of too many aspects of Giacomo Sain’s production means it never quite manages to convince of the true beauty or the lyrical quality of this problem play: indeed in this case, some of the problems are of his own making."
1198,1198,Ought To Be Clowns,29/09/2016,mag9l,Floyd Collins, Wilton’s Music Hall,"One of the joys of having this blog is the aide memoire aspect of it, the theatrical diary that it has become, allowing me to trace how my tastes have shifted. I say this in particular reference to Floyd Collins, a show I didn’t much enjoy the first time I saw it at its 2012 production at the Southwark Playhouse and yet which on this revisit, four years later, I adored.  A substantial part of it comes with the musical complexity of Adam Guettel’s score, one I (still) think few people would fall in love with instantly, but also one which has repaid repeated listens and the breadth of performers yearning to sing his music (Audra McDonald, Kelli O’Hara…), incrementally convincing me of its worth and culminating in the gloriously revelatory sound of Tom Brady’s band tucked away in the balcony of Wilton’s Music Hall.
Jonathan Butterell’s production revels in its simplicity, the steel scaffolding of the split-stage design allowing for an interesting perspective, placing the titular character at the heart of the action – even if he is trapped down a cave for most of the show – whilst his friends and family try to free him. And even in 1920s small-town Kentucky, Tina Landau shows how a media circus whipped up around him, Butterell letting us draw the parallels of rapacious capitalism for ourselves. And through the sheer intensity of the performances, any perceived thinness in the drama just melts away. As Floyd himself, Ashley Robinson is fiercely committed in showing both the external and internal life of this tragic figure, Daniel Booroff is a compelling figure as the reporter who grows close to him, and Samuel Thomas as Floyd’s brother equally impresses as he tries to keep spirits high in an increasingly desperate situation."
1199,1199,Ought To Be Clowns,09/11/2017,Ian,No Place Like Hope, Old Red Lion,"On a night when the big West End opening of the evening is an absolute testosterone-fest, it is rather gratifying to see people actually doing something about it, to try and start to redress the balance in their own way. Producer Holly Donovan is one such shining light, using her own negative experiences of gender bias to act as an impetus to finding a play that passed the Bechdel Test and then building a production around it that uses an all-female creative team. Callum McGowan’s No Place Like Hope is that play and what a delicately moving thing it is, depicting an unlikely friendship between two women reeling from the tragedy that life has thrown at them. Becca is a troubled young woman who is carrying out her community service at a hospice and Anna is a cancer patient there and from inauspicious beginnings, a kinship is recognised as they each find in the other something to cling onto, something that might alleviate their despair. It’s a soul-aching loneliness that is the crucial connection, the unexpected gift of company that they can provide the glue that keeps them together, but it is the eloquence of McGowan’s musings on mortality that prove the most tenderly devastating. The stark acceptance of the reduction of an entire life to one sparsely furnished room is a weight that Clare Corbett’s Anna bears balefully, an indignity that twists almost as painfully as the disease ravaging her from the inside."
1200,1200,Ought To Be Clowns,09/08/2017,Ian,Funeral Meats, King’s Head’s Queer Season,"Cradeaux Alexander’s Funeral Meats is a more oblique piece than Coming Clean, set in the aftermath of a funeral where the remnants of the wake come together and clash – “I thought grief was supposed to bring people together” someone laments at one point. The deceased is Luke and Laura’s famous mother but the siblings aren’t close, and also thrown into the mix are Luke’s ex-husband Felix and the enigmatic Barbara, an old friend of the dead woman. Over 5 short scenes running from 7pm through to midnight, they dig into their shared history and their fragmented present, a never-ending flow of booze loosening lips and inhibitions. Alexander coils his characters with all sorts of differing agendas, the legacies of the past having impacted on them in contrasting ways but in the relatively short space of time here, doesn’t quite unpack them all sufficiently. The most powerful thread comes from the exploration of mental health issues, Ramona Von Pusch’s Laura nailing the rapidly intensifying manic energy that prefigures a crisis. And there’s fascinating stuff in the collapse of Luke and Felix’s relationship due to gay marriage not being recognised in the same way across international borders, you long for more from Alexander’s Luke and Luca Pusceddu’s Felix here.. "
1201,1201,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2017,mag9l,The Glass Menagerie, Duke of York’s,"John Tiffany might well be taking over the West End by stealth. His Critic’s Circle-winning Harry Potter and The Cursed Child is still maintaining its extraordinarily successful run, currently booking until April 2018, and now his production of Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie, previously seen in the US and last year in Edinburgh, arrives at the Duke of York’s. And though Tiffany’s gift for direction may be taking fantastical flight over at the Palace Theatre, rest assured it is no less magical here. Kate O’Flynn’s Laura first appears like a spirit, passing right through the furniture as she is evoked by her brother, likewise Cherry Jones’ Amanda arrives out of thin air.  Yet for all this, including movement largely governed by long-time collaborator Steven Hoggett so that the eating of dinner becomes as finely choreographed as a ballet, the production’s magic comes from the humanity with which its characters are treated. As narrated from the future by her estranged son Tom, Amanda Wingfield is often overplayed, the faded Southern belle craving the limelight, but here she is a mother first and foremost and Jones never lets us forget that. She’s incredibly expansive and inextricably lost in memories of her youth but here she is deeply caring and self-aware too, it is a beautifully judged performance from an actress finally making her London debut after an illustrious Broadway career. After the interval, once Laura’s gentleman caller finally comes to visit, the production amps up to another level though. Their fateful meeting is a beautifully written and perfectly constructed scene and it is done achingly well here. Brian J Smith (seen recently in Netflix drama Sense8) is absolute charm personified, seductive in the kindest way as he teases the reticent Laura out of her shell. And O’Flynn responds flawlessly, visibly growing in stature as a scarcely imagined dream looks set to be coming true and then almost frozen by the shellshock of it being whipped away, her arms remain outstretched as if the ghost of an embrace is better than the harsh reality to which she knows she must return. Between this and her show-stealing Dr Peep in No Offence, is there any more exciting British actor at the moment? And Michael Esper’s guilt-ridden Tom, loosely based on Williams’ himself, is a compelling figure looking back on the events of his life. Bob Crowley’s striking set design emphasises this psychological aspect, locating the Wingfields’ cramped apartment in an almost dream-like black void with a spiralling fire escape, and Natasha Katz’s superb lighting softens and sharpens the focus according to the level of his guilt. In short, it is fantastic. The Glass Menagerie has always been a great play and here, it receives the kind of production that will convince a whole new generation exactly why that is. "
1202,1202,Ought To Be Clowns,22/09/2005,Ian,Guys and Dolls, Piccadilly,"Set in 1950s New York, Nathan Detroit is an organiser of gambling tournaments whose long-suffering showgirl fiancée Miss Adelaide is determined to finally get him up the aisle. Sky Masterton is a gambler who is bet that he can’t get a woman of Detroit’s choosing to have dinner with him in Havana, but when he chooses missionary Sarah Brown, the unexpected happens for all of them. But the show is probably best known for Frank Loesser’s songs, a genuinely classic score full of amazing numbers. And this is where the show really excelled. The big numbers like ‘Luck, Be A Lady’ and ‘Sit Down, You’re Rocking The Boat’ fizzled with amazing energy and fantastic choreography from Rob Ashford. Krakowski was every bit as good as I hoped she’d be as Miss Adelaide, her saucy cabaret numbers full of liveliness and verve and she also played the sensitive side of this big-hearted woman perfectly too. Opposite her, Douglas Hodge was the epitome of affable charm, though I was a little disappointed with Jenna Russell’s Sarah, a little too close to bland whilst playing the prim missionary."
1203,1203,Ought To Be Clowns,14/07/2010,Ian,Lingua Franca, Finborough,"Continuing the 30th anniversary celebrations at the Finborough Theatre is the world premiere of a new play by Peter Nichols, Lingua Franca. The play is set in 1950s Florence, where Flowers gets a job teaching English at Lingua Franca, a shambolic language school housing a ragbag collection of individuals from across the globe, all struggling to come to terms with a new society in a Europe no longer at war, whilst luxuriating in the Florentine cultural bounty all around them. The programme informed me that the lead character Steven Flowers is also in one of his earlier plays, Privates on Parade, it made no difference to me not having seen that but there’s a neat bit of casting in that Ian Gelder who appears here in a different role, played that character in the original RSC production. At the centre of the story is a love triangle of sorts: once Stephen has become accustomed to his new way of living, he throws himself into a life of gay abandon, whipping his classes up into a raucous frenzy of singalongs and chants as a different way of learning and having already caught the eye and rapt attention of repressed and depressed English Peggy, launches headlong into a passionate, physical affair with German Heidi. As Stephen, Chris New brings a wonderfully warm charm which makes it easy to see why so many women fall for him and plays the darker, crueller streak that comes as he ruthlessly pursues his sexual urges at the expense of all else equally well. Charlotte Randle’s Peggy is highly strung from the word go and whilst a strong performance, her false bonhomie masking a world of pain and tiredness of rations, I felt she could stand to dial it down a little to start with, it was a little too shouty from the outset in the small space of the Finborough and left little range for her to go to. And whilst Heidi is a fascinating character, as a child she was part of the Hitler Youth, she’s not really given enough emotional range and so Natalie Walter has to work hard to make us care for her. Elsewhere in the motley crew of language teachers are the turbaned Rula Lenska as Russian Jew Irena with a deliciously dry accent and and Abigail McKern’s Australian Madge who frequently steals the show with her language lessons, managing the not inconsiderable feat of teaching both German and French in a broad Aussie accent to hysterical effect. Enzo Cilenti’s Italian school manager was also nicely observed, constantly picking up English colloquialisms and rolling them around with an excellently consistent accent and Ian Gelder brings a beautiful tenderness to his ageing academic, having lived through two world wars but still with something to learn about life. Bringing together such a diverse group allows Nichols to work in some nicely contrasting post-war viewpoints: different nationalities and different ages have a wide-ranging spectrum of opinions on life after the war and vastly different experiences. There’s desperation that life still isn’t that much better, there’s deep-seated xenophobia and the distrust of other nationalities and their little quirks, there’s emotional constipation, and whilst we’re in a post-war context, it is neatly suggested that the war merely serves as a cover for many of these prejudices. The headlong pursuit of sexual freedom didn’t play quite as big a role as I had thought and I’m not sure precisely what the point was there, but it was still a fun thread to follow."
1204,1204,Ought To Be Clowns,28/10/2010,Ian,Contractions, Theatre Delicatessen,"Mike Bartlett’s play Contractions is presented here by Fly Theatre in a new production which takes place in a real office at Theatre Delicatessen, currently housed in a venue tucked away just off Oxford Street . The show is made up of a series of meetings between employee Emma and her line manager starting off an appraisal process but swiftly becoming something darker as this is a company that takes a very keen interest in the personal lives of its workforce and will go to seemingly any length to ensure productivity isn’t affected. As it turns out, the period it covers is quite substantial as we follow the burgeoning relationship between Emma and a male colleague Darren as it develops into something more despite company policy. It is all about the ownership of employees in a tough corporate world, the level of intrusion into their private lives that is acceptable and how far people are willing to go for job security, money or indeed love, and it is captured brilliantly in the interplay between the two characters. Bartlett has such an amazing ear for the verbal games that people play, for the brutal power that words can have when applied with the surgical precision that they are here in this world of corporate legalese and double-speak, and indeed the way in which one’s own words can be used against oneself, which is by turns comic and horrific, yet always utterly believable. Holly Beth Morgan did a marvellous job at tracing the journey of Emma, from her initial bemusement at the intrusive questioning, learning how to play her manager at the same game and running through the extreme emotions provoked by the events in her life, culminating in its heartbreaking dénouement. But it is Abigail Rokison who really shines with all the best lines in the show, but crucially executed with perfect timing: she really knows how to use silences and emphases to get the most out of the material. I loved the tiny flickers of uncertainty that crossed her face once Emma had learned how to be a bit canny thus causing moments of self-doubt in her mastery of the contracts and the situation, but it was her displays of faux emotion that provided the best moments of the show with the most hysterically funny use of a post-it note since Bubble was let loose in the stationary cupboard in Absolutely Fabulous, which is then pushed even further in a second twist with a brilliantly mordant humour. Seats are quite limited as the office is quite cosy and it is a limited run so get booking, and I love the fact that I caught a matinée as there was something alarmingly realistic about seeing the events play out in the daytime when the exact same thing could be happening for real in any of the neighbouring buildings. So a nicely quirky production of an interesting play and a great opportunity to see more of this playwright’s work: I am fast becoming a Bartlett groupie! I'm going to see this tomorrow evening now. Never been to this theatre so curious to see it, and quite excited to see another Mike Bartlett play. Andy Were you not with me for the reading of Bull at the Finborough? It is quite similar in style to that.And it isn't a theatre so much as an office building, it really is and so much the better for it. (And wait until you find out who played the manager in the Royal Court version a couple of years ago!!) The transfer of the post-it note was brilliant. A very funny play indeed. Though the rest of the audience really did not seem to be watching the same play; I was the only one snorting with laughter, apart from the the theatre manager and the lady from behind the bar who also came in to watch"

1206,1206,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2017,Ian,Mosquitoes, National Theatre,"Just a quickie for this as it closes this week (I had the unfortunate accident of being in Vienna for its press night). Lucy Kirkwood’s Mosquitoes has been a sell-out success for the National, packing out the Dorfman perhaps initially for its deluxe casting of two Olivias – Colman and Williams – but latterly due to some superb word of mouth as well. And given that this is largely a play about two sisters who can’t help but bicker all their lives, it is brilliantly well cast. Williams is Alice, a scientist working at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and Colman is Jenny, a medical sales rep living in Luton. Nominally, the former is a success, the latter a fuckup, an idea reinforced by Jenny arriving in Geneva to recuperate from a devastating personal loss. But Kirkwood’s writing is far too nuanced to let that be all, she thoroughly interrogates our preconceptions as she whirls through a universe-ful of ideas including anti-vaxxers, revenge porn, society’s inherent misogyny, science and religion and much more besides. If anything, this is where Mosquitoes is perhaps weakest, in its sheer surfeit of content. It is undoubtedly nice to be able to wrestle with a complex play with so much within it, but Rufus Norris’ production has a lot of wrangling to do and the resulting abrupt shifts in tone take some getting used to, particularly in the way the strong sense of humour is cheek by jowl with the harrowing plot developments that drive the narrative as the sisters deal with each other and the other family members drawn into their orbit."
1207,1207,Ought To Be Clowns,20/07/2017,Ian,Twilight Song, Park,"Completed shortly before his death in 2014, Kevin Elyot’s Twilight Song now belatedly receives its premiere courtesy of the Park Theatre. The play doesn’t emerge as one of his strongest though, the shadow of the excellent My Night With Reg lingers long over the scant 75 minutes here and you’re left wondering just how completed the play was – would it have benefitted from another turn or two in the development mangle after its initial run. Twilight Song finds itself split between the present day and the 1960s, looking at the relationship between homosexualist Barry, his mother Isabella and his wider family. From his boyhood when decriminalisation was just around the corner but still too late for a closeted uncle, to his present day where sexual liberation hasn’t prevented him from frustrated singledom, we see how individual happiness doesn’t necessarily follow societal change no matter your sexuality or generation. Thing is though, it proves rather hard to care too much about characters sketched as thinly as these – such a truncated running time and such a format allows precious little time for character development and to put it bluntly, the dialogue here just isn’t up to the task. It’s only the quality of the acting that pulls you through – Paul Higgins’ unfulfilled Barry contrasted and deepened by his doubling as his ineffectual father, Philip Bretherton and an excellent Hugh Ross as the uncles. Perhaps reflecting a lack of confidence in the material, Anthony Banks’ production relies a little too heavily on overbearing musical cues to generate a depth of feeling that rarely emanates from the text. And the overall result is of something frustratingly slight and hardly the kind of legacy you imagine Elyot would be happy leaving. "
1208,1208,Ought To Be Clowns,15/08/2014,Ian,Jezebel, Soho Theatre,"There’s something rather refreshing about Mark Cantan’s Jezebel, newly opened in the attic room/oven of the Soho Theatre upstairs, in its uncomplicated nature. There’s nothing particularly ground-breaking in its format or earth-shattering in its content but rather, there’s a finely balanced comedy with a sparkling modern take on its farcical shenanigans and which, pleasingly, feels no need to try and mine elements of social relevance or emotional depth in search of ‘significance’. Sometimes a play can just be fun and not have mean anything more than that. So it’s something of a sex farce which slides into a comedy of errors. Both in their early 30s, Alan and Robin are both coming off a series of unsuccessful relationship so when they get set up and the chemistry between them is palpable (and hilariously double-entendre-ridden), it seems their luck may have finally changed. But eight months in, that initial flame has fizzled a little and so they turn sexual adventuring to spice things up, working their way through allsorts until settling on a threesome, the kookily, hapless-in-love Jezebel being their third. It is tempting to see something of the sitcom in Cantan’s structure – the three characters prowl about Ciarán O’Melia’s utilitarian set and when not acting in the scene, can be found delivering mockumentary-style interludes à la Modern Family – and that’s no bad thing. Lynne Parker’s production (from José Miguel Jiménez’s original direction) maintains a wonderfully sardonic tone, beautifully essayed by Peter Daly and Margaret McAuliffe as the would-be kinky couple and Valerie O’Connor’s brilliant artist who just can’t catch a break when it comes to men."
1209,1209,Ought To Be Clowns,12/01/2017,mag9l,HE(ART), TheatreN16,"An interesting change of tack here from Andrew Maddock, who has been steadily carving out a niche for himself in doing creative things in and around the world of monologues (qv #1, #2, #3). Opening at Balham’s TheatreN16, HE(ART) starts in a Maddockian (Maddockish? Maddockesque?) way with two separate duologues intercut with each other, and playing out at the same time. But over the running time of just more than an hour, it transforms into transgressively exciting. Staged in the round (well, the square) in a boxing ring-like space in this production by Lonesome Schoolboy, In the one corner we have young couple Alice and Rhys doing battle over what kind of art they want to buy for their living room. And in the other, there’s siblings Kev and Sam, gearing up for an altogether different kind of conflict, characterised by the fact that the former should be in prison.  Constantly switching between the two strands, Maddock and director Niall Phillips conjure up something really rather beautiful. The lovers’ squabbles about what makes ‘great’ art draw us right into the heart of their lives, even as we see the fissures of their relationship as they struggle to deal with the implications of his heart condition. And the siblings’ lives are no less vividly drawn as they search for a moment of calm amid the utterly misguided but good intentions of a scheme to help their mother that feels destined to end in tears.  Maddock’s writing revels in its quiet humanity – the playful repartee between Alex Reynolds’ tightly wound Alice and Jack Gogarty’s so-laidback-he’s-horizontal Rhys delights as it runs the gamut of cultural discourse from Rembrandt to Rocky. And Shane Noone and Flora Dawson conjure something achingly touching as Noone’s Kev tries desperately to be a good son and a good brother the only way he knows how, by breaking the law, even as it breaks his own heart to involve his emotionally challenged sister – an intelligently sensitive performance from Dawson. "
1210,1210,Ought To Be Clowns,24/09/2014,Ian,Electra, Old Vic,"There’s something fiercely elemental about Kristin Scott Thomas’ extraordinary performance as Electra that makes it the perfect choice for the in-the-round setting that the Old Vic has wisely kept for a season of work. The sheer depth of feeling she generates like a vortex that sucks us all in, with her at its dark heart, hollowed out by grief and howling through the floor at Persephone to unleash the power of the underworld or perhaps just swallow her whole to release her from the torment of her existence. Why so sad? Well, her father Agamemnon sacrificed her sister Iphigenia which annoyed her mother Clytemnestra (along with his schtupping Cassandra) who then murdered Agamemnon with her new lover (and his cousin) Aegisthus. Electra thus swore to avenge her father’s death, sending away her young brother Orestes to return when he was old to enough to fulfil the deed, and remaining rebelliously in court with her sister as an almost impossibly embittered soul. Frank McGuinness’ version of Sophocles’ tale, used to great acclaim by Zoë Wanamaker at the Donmar, makes a virtue of its stripped-back simplicity and in Ian Rickson’s astute production, never lets us forget just how on the edge Electra is. Dirtied and damaged, Scott Thomas is never off the stage aside from the opening scene and ensures we’re locked right beside her in her downwards spiral – the scene when she is reunited with Jack Lowden’s Orestes as she careers from grief to glee is excruciatingly fantastic as the fragility of her emotional wellbeing is laid bare. The other characters thus have to step gingerly around Electra to try and avoid being trapped in her whirlpool of woe. Liz White is achingly, beautifully poised as Chrysothemis, the other sister more happy to appease her mother, perhaps recognising that her prospects in this patriarchal society aren’t necessarily completely over (unlike Electra’s), and Diana Quick is awesomely fearsome as that mother, one scene enough to convey the complex layers of vengeful motivation that plague this mother/daughter relationship, which is strikingly echoed in the final scene. Tyrone Huggins’ Aegisthus is intriguingly done though, less obviously the villain of Electra’s mind – suggesting perhaps an element of warped perspective on her behalf – and more philosophical. His searching question (and I hope I got this right) “shall there be killing after killing forever?” stands proud in the face of the inalienable concept of justice that lies at the heart of Electra, and Orestes’, being, the mellifluous voices of Julia Dearden, Golda Roshuevel and Thalissa Teixeira as the chorus adding to the commentary on their actions."
1211,1211,Ought To Be Clowns,09/11/2012,Ian,The Effect, National Theatre,"“Call it what you want, just don’t let it define you” Though it has arguably had a variable strike rate in terms of hits and misses, the Cottesloe Theatre seems determined to go out roaring in stylish flames before it closes for renovation to re-emerge as the Dorfman, as huge successes The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time and This House are now followed by Lucy Prebble’s new play The Effect in a co-production with Headlong which, if there’s any justice in the world, should have some kind of further life as with the previous two plays which are transferring into the West End and the Olivier respectively. Miriam Buether works her transformative magic once again to reconfigure the theatre into the waiting room of a modern private clinic, one in which a clinical trial is about to begin. Two people have signed up to try out this new drug and two doctors monitor them, looking for the answers that they hope will be provided. What they are looking for is to see how much their medicine can influence what we call our feelings, our emotions, as they try to figure out if the highs of love and attraction and the lows of deep depression can be controlled with just a tweak of the dosage. But though they are seeking to run a scrupulous experiment, their human subjects respond in unexpected ways as they try to tease apart what is real and what is manufactured in the world of heady emotion they are now feeling. With it being a Headlong production, there’s an unmistakable physicality about the show and none more than in the movement, which marks it as directly related to Enron. This stylised body language is used most effectively in the first half to suggest the interminable passing of time and the repetition of activities in a medical trial and combined with Jon Driscoll’s colourful scrolling projections, they work extremely well. There’s much less of this vivacity after the interval as the drama heightens, but there’s one more lovely visual surprise in store.   But it is a beautifully written piece of theatre as well. The way that Prebble manages to encapsulate so much of what makes up a relationship in so short a space of time is nothing short of a miracle, and it is given exceptional life by the performances from Billie Piper and Jonjo O’Neill as the subjects who find themselves experiencing so much. From the initial thrill of promise that comes from illicit, heady flirtation to the genuine charge of finding an explosive emotional and physical connection, we’re swept headlong into this world and it is made all the more tragic for not knowing if it is real or the pills. And the lows are depicted just as convincingly as the highs with some simply devastating fight work and an aching sense of confused regret creeping in as resolves are tested all around. Against this entirely gripping love story, Prebble puts the more reflective story of the medical staff working on the project. It’s a brave choice as it is a less vivid and perhaps less emotionally compelling strand but it is one which explores the themes of the play just as much, especially in Hille’s emotive dissection of how little we genuinely know about the causes of depression. And the quiet devastation that builds as she duels with Tom Goodman-Hill’s senior doctor over what the results of the tests actually mean and gradually loses her grip on her own mental state has its own moving power. Overall, it does feel a little overlong at the minute (press night is on Tuesday) and it is tempting to say that this is something that Goold could address rather simply by doing everything a little bit less. It’s not that there are ideas in here that don’t work – indeed in my opinion, I thought they all paid off well – but rather that there’s too much over-extension. In the utterly gorgeous scene that closes the first act, it feel like the hand is overplayed with a couple of interchanges too many, when the central point has already been so eloquently made. So too with the final scene, soundtracked by Ingrid Michaelson’s ‘Keep Breathing’, it’s a great moment but just a shade too long at the moment. But make no mistake, The Effect is a pretty exceptional piece of theatre. After the disappointment (for me, at least) of People, this felt very much closer to my vision of what a national theatre should be doing and so it is probably a reflection of the National Theatre’s strength that it can manage to be more than one thing to one person. But do your damnedest to get tickets for this, who knows what effect it might have it you miss it.*"

1213,1213,Ought To Be Clowns,14/11/2014,Ian,Macbeth, Omnibus and Clapham Common,"Following handsome bearded men down shadowy paths has long been a vocation on Clapham Common but for the next couple of weeks, the entertainment being provided is of a more theatrical bent as the Omnibus presents a promenade production of the Scottish play which leads its audience on a journey both outside and in. It’s a canny, modernised take on Macbeth which makes inventive use of its locale to thrust us right in the midst of the action. Whether huddled around a bonfire in the empty paddling pool, jammed into a crowded alleyway, guests at the banqueting table or spectators in the midst of hand-to-hand combat, Gemma Kerr’s production is more site-responsive than truly immersive and is the better for it, with less distraction from the bleakness of this world that has been created, where society is crumbling and the privations of long-running war are felt keenly by everyone. This emerges in little details like Duncan providing his hostess Lady Macbeth with a sneaky pack of contraband fags but also more obviously in the presentation of the witches as homeless people, their babbling chatter easily dismissed until its prophetic allure seizes the attention of battle hero Macbeth. Gregory Finnegan and Samuel Collings’ Banquo share an easy, palpable chemistry as the war-wearied pair pause for breath, only to be sucked into a nightmarish race for power. Finnegan delivers a combination of charisma and chilling ambition that is equally compelling and disturbing and it is no mystery what Jennifer Jackson’s Lady M sees in him, the bubbling malevolence that first drives her to extreme action takes hold in him in the furious battle scenes of the end. Jackson’s hard-edged anguish is well played, her descent into madness hard to watch, and there’s good support too from Francesca Tomlinson as an unexpectedly moving Ross and Alex Phelps’s preppy Malcolm."
1214,1214,Ought To Be Clowns,06/10/2018,Ian,Once, Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch,"I’d forgotten just how much I like Once. I saw it a couple of times in its 2013-15 West End incarnation (review #1, review #2) and its atypical subtlety was a big hit for me, particularly in the gentle mood cultivated by Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová’s music and lyrics. The fact that it isn’t a brassy balls-out West End musical might explain why it has taken a little time for its regional premiere to emerge but mercifully, that time has now come. For that, we have co-producers Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch and New Wolsey Theatre Ipswich to thank. And director Peter Rowe’s actor-musician production slips into the groove perfectly, as warm and comforting as a pint of Guinness or three in your favourite old man’s pub – and occasionally just as rowdy as well. With Enda Walsh’s book taken from John Carney’s original film, its bittersweetly romantic tone feels perfect as autumn descends.  Daniel Healy (who understudied the main role in the West End) plays the Irish busker whose broken-hearted songs capture the attention of a Czech single mother – an emotive Emma Lucia – and what follows is a story of slow-burning attraction, missed chances and vacuum cleaners, tender enough to move even the stubbornest of souls. Yes it is rom-com territory but there’s something more here too, I’m sure of it and not just the beauty of ‘Falling Slowly’."
1215,1215,Ought To Be Clowns,14/11/2014,Ian,State Red, Hampstead Downstairs,"Whoop whoop, that’s the sound of da police, or at least a whole lotta police-related drama at the Hampstead Theatre, both upstairs and down. In the main house, Roy Williams’ Wildefire is examining life in the Met from the street level whilst downstairs, Atiha Sen Gupta makes a long awaited return with State Red, another new play looking at institutionalised racism in the force (and society at large too) right up to the highest level of Police Commissioner and asks just how far we’d go in the name of family. White, living in Muswell Hill and in his 50s, it seems Richard is a shoo-in for the job. 36 years of service, a mixed marriage for the diversity card, schmoozing with all the right people, the only fly in the ointment is the return of his son Luke from a year AWOL after an incident at work. For he’s a copper too and after shooting a black unarmed teenager dead, has suffered something of a breakdown. With the inquest fast approaching, he’s threatening to smash through the party line with his own version of events even if doing so would ruin his father’s prospects. Michael Jackson once sang that “it don’t matter if you’re black or white” but in a society that has never really managed to come to terms with its multiculturalism, it’s much more complicated than that. Gupta looks at the shades of grey inbetween right and wrong – even if Luke were guilty of something more than an accident, could not the potential benefit of his father’s appointment to a position of real influence not outweigh that? And that a racial epithet taunting Luke’s mixed-race heritage may have triggered the shooting further complicates the tangle of race relations that lies at the heart of so much tension."
1216,1216,Ought To Be Clowns,30/05/2017,Ian,The Girls, Phoenix,"So having not gotten round to seeing The Girls for whatever reason (mainly that I didn’t want to), I finally bit the bullet last week and within 24 hours, the show posted closing notices for its West End run. The Girls will then head out on a two year national tour from August 2018, aiming to visit 42 theatres across the UK and if that does perhaps seem a little ambitious, it is hard to shake the feeling that the musical might be more suited out on the road. Gary Barlow and Tim Firth’s show started life in “the regions” – I saw it in Leeds and my family saw it in Manchester – and away from the cut-throat economics of the West End, it may well thrive again. The instant recognition of the Calendar Girls story has a different currency when there’s only a week’s worth of performances to sell; one gets the sense that the maxim about familiarity breeding contempt may have come into play at the Phoenix. The Girls is cosy and gentle, undoubtedly moving but deeply conventional. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing but it does mean that there’s not a jot of a surprise about a production of a story which, as already established, is already well-known. It shows in the slow pacing of a first half that consists of an awful lot of scene-setting, in sitcom-level humour and retrogressive gender politics, hell, even in the fact of the persistent use of ‘girls’. For these are women, older women at that, taking the limelight for once. And as the second half clicks into wonderful gear, the likes of Joanna Riding and Claire Moore, Claire Machin and Sophie-Louise Dann are glorious in their blossoming out, but not entirely away from, the bittersweet realities of life, much like the sunflowers strewn across Robert Jones’ set in the inspired finale. Ben Hunter is good value for money too as head-boy-in-the-making Danny."
1217,1217,Ought To Be Clowns,10/03/2013,Ian,Purple Heart, Gate Theatre,"The scabrous humour of Bruce Norris’ last play Clybourne Park was a huge success seeing a West End transfer from the Royal Court and a clean sweep of drama awards on both sides of the Atlantic. He returns to the Royal Court very soon with The Low Road but the Gate Theatre has mounted a revival of his 2002 play Purple Heart. Set in an anonymous Midwestern city, a family struggles to rebuild their lives after the death of Gene, a soldier in the Vietnam War, the impact of such a terrible loss affecting his mother, his wife and his son in different ways. Norris dissects the complexity of grief on the different members of this family with his customary excoriating insight, challenging what society deems to be the correct emotional responses with the unconventional Carla. Rejecting the conventional tropes of mourning, the generic platitudes and proffered casseroles from oppressively well-meaning neighbours, she lounges in her dressing gown, swigging as much booze as she can. But there’s little escape at home – her son Thor is acting out on his increasingly violent imagination and mother-in-law Grace is relentless with her forced good cheer barely masking a concern or propriety. It is takes the arrival of a stranger at the door, a veteran with his own agenda and a box of doughnuts, to really shake up the broken dynamic of this family. The play was written during the build-up to the war in Iraq and it is tempting to see the anger of lessons unlearnt here, but what it is clear is the way in which Norris utilises the sharpest humour in his cracking dialogue as he brutally pummels his characters. It is almost too much in the case of Carla, Amelia Lowdell is strong in portraying the conflicted mix of swirling emotion but it’s so abrasive, so stinging, that the balance doesn’t quite feel right. Linda Broughton’s insistent Grace becomes more sympathetic despite her endless nagging and there’s a neat sense of obliqueness about Oliver Coopersmith’s Thor, quite how much of this dysfunction has been internalised is never apparent, the legacy of the future left somewhat in question."
1218,1218,Ought To Be Clowns,07/11/2015,mag9l,Harlequinade / All On Her Own, Garrick,"Part of Kenneth Branagh’s opening salvo as his year-long residency at the Garrick begins is the Terence Rattigan double header of Harlequinade and All On Her Own. When originally performed, Harlequinade was paired up with another of Rattigan’s short plays The Browning Version to beef up the bill and the same thinking has been applied here. Taking advantage of Zoë Wanamaker’s presence in the company, Branagh has introduced one-woman 30-minute play All On Her Own (also known as Duologue) to the programme, playing directly before Harlequinade with nary an interval between them. One can see the theoretical case for the decision, ensuring West End prices can still be charged but providing a much more slimline companion piece to the three hours of The Winter’s Tale but in reality, it’s an odd pairing that demonstrates little complementarity (apart from for Rattigan completists). All On Her Own is a grand showcase for Wanamaker, as her widow returns from a party somewhat tipsy and begins to reminisce about her dead husband, even talking to him. It’s a little bit funny, it’s a little bit sad, but it’s a little bit perplexing too, especially as it has no connection to the ensuing Harlequinade.  Which is a bit of a revelation, especially as it has previously been saddled with something of a dodgy reputation. But as with French Without Tears, Rattigan was no slouch when it came to comedy, his work just needs to be treated in the right way. And Branagh and Rob Ashford nail that here, playing up the all the staginess of a touring company going through the motions of a rehearsal of Romeo and Juliet in a theatre in the Midlands. As a backstage drama, it is the personal lives of the actors that come into play more than Shakespeare’s words, as increasingly farcical shenanigans threaten to derail the whole production. "
1219,1219,Ought To Be Clowns,22/04/2017,Ian,Escape the Room, Namco Funscape,"Here, the escape-the-room concept has been tailored down to a trim 765 second, just under 13 minutes in which you and your team of up to six need to hunt down clues, figure out a set of puzzles, and save the day if you can. There’s a code of silence as with all these games which means I can’t say too much because – spoilers! but I don’t think it is too much to reveal that you take on the role of policemen."
1220,1220,Ought To Be Clowns,19/10/2018,Ian,The Distance You Have Come, Cockpit,"Scott Alan’s reputation as a songwriter is without question. Over a number of albums over the last decade (a fair few of which I’ve reviewed here), he’s been able to count on an extraordinary array of performers to bring his music to life, songs which are unafraid to chart the lows as well as the highs of living, loving, losing, dreaming… The Distance You Have Come sees him maintain that quality of guestlist in a live setting, as he entwines together over 20 of his compositions into a song cycle. It proves a curious enterprise though, one which doesn’t quite cohere in a way that the quality of these songs deserves. Alan wrote the book for the show, as well as directing, and you do wonder whether an outside perspective might have helped. The book tries to do an awful lot in the space of a few snatched sentences between songs and its ambition feels somewhat unnecessary if the show is to be a song cycle rather than a fledgling musical.  As it is, emergent storylines take baffling leaps – is she no longer a lesbian? did she just pop a sprog from nowhere? has he just been sexually assaulted or was it an excuse to get him to take his shirt off? Some of these ultimately get answered but it just feels a bit much. And matters aren’t helped by direction which lacks the fluidity to deal with a staging in the round at the Cockpit – for far too many moments in far too many songs, I was left looking at the backs of people’s heads.  What saves the evening to a certain degree is the quality of the cast. It’s always a thrill to see top musical theatre talent in such intimacy and so it proves here – Andy Coxon and Adrian Hansel are adorably sweet as they fast-forward from Grindr hook-ups to gay parenting, Alexia Khadime and Dean John-Wilson deliver emotional fraughtness with beautiful skill, and Jodie Jacobs is given free rein to exercise her superb comic timing as she bounces from one to the other, just for a walk you know…    "
1221,1221,Ought To Be Clowns,04/12/2012,Ian,Sweet Smell of Success, Arcola,"The stereotypical image of musical theatre as a happy clappy ball of cheesy fun would surely be less prevalent if shows like Sweet Smell of Success were better known. But paradoxically, it benefits from having its British premiere out on the fringe in the dark warehouse surroundings of Dalston’s Arcola as this bitterly desperate tale of the hollowness at the centre of the world of celebrity journalism in 1950s America certainly benefits from the intimacy of this theatre. It has its challenges though, as an uncompromisingly bleak tale of immorality which doesn’t always quite get the balance right as director Mehmet Ergen tries to leaven the mood.  John Guare’s story centres on JJ Hunsecker, a vicious-tongued and immensely influential columnist who has 60 million readers and is willing to do absolutely anything to keep them and his lofty position. His weakness lies in his troublingly deep affection for his half-sister Susan and his attempts to manipulate her life and her relationships threaten to drag all them down, including JJ’s protégé Sidney Falcone, all too willing to carry out his boss’s wishes in order to get the leg up he craves. The ethics of sensationalist journalism of course have a compelling currency in today’s post-Leveson environment but though David Bamber’s Hunsecker is at the centre of the story, there’s never really a sense that we get to know much about him. And the intimacy of the story is also lost with the (admittedly often excellent) ensemble scenes which brim with inventive choreography from Nathan M Wright but somehow seem to belong to a different show. Marvin Hamlisch’s score sounds excellent though, Bob Broad’s band coping well with the unexpected turns the music often takes and the performances are strong across the board. Stuart Matthew Price’s Dallas, Susan’s boyfriend, is as nuanced and affecting as we have come to expect from this most accomplished of ‘up-and-coming’ talent, Caroline Keiff’s Susan just sounds gorgeous (though I’m not quite sure why she hadn’t just run for the hills given her creepy brother) and Adrian der Gregorian negotiates Sydney’s slide into the morass of immorality with skill."

1223,1223,Ought To Be Clowns,11/06/2017,Ian,Poppa Plock’s Wonky Workshop, The Depot,"Another weekend, another escape-the-room challenge, this time in the form of Handmade Mysteries’ Poppa Plock’s Wonky Workshop at The Depot, the pub that is underneath the Pleasance in North London. Handmade Mysteries’ take on the problem-solving genre is a richly fantastical one as we’d previously experienced in their Lady Chastity’s Reserve and Poppa Plock proved to be no exception. The set-up for the game, as best I can recall, is that your team needs to complete one final project by toymaker Plock in order to escape the workshop, which is fantastically eerie with its childhood-games-gone-wrong aesthetic. In order to find the component parts for that project, there’s a whole series of clues to find, puzzles to solve, codes to crack, games to play, you get the picture… Guiding you on your way is the saucy wind-up merchant Wynne, who has mastered the art of creeping up unexpectedly but also judges the assistance he doles out extremely well, making sure that you’re not lingering too long on any of the tougher challenges. As ever, the fun comes in doing it as a team, so it is worth finding enough pals (up to six) to do it exclusively, as so much of your success comes from the communication between you all. "
1224,1224,Ought To Be Clowns,23/11/2011,Ian,Reasons To Be Pretty, Almeida,"Neil LaBute has developed a reputation for fierce writing, exposing the darker side of human nature with an often uncompromisingly abrasive approach, but his new play at the Almeida – Reasons To Be Pretty – sees him adopt a slightly mellower tone to devastatingly powerful effect. Continuing the exploration of society’s obsession with looks and beauty that occupied earlier plays like The Shape of Things and Fat Pig, LaBute also examines disillusionment in relationships and how that can lead to betrayal. The play opens with an intensely sharp argument between lovers Steph and Greg: he described her as regular in comparison to a new arrival in the factory where he works with best friend Kent and she found out when her friend Carly told her: she is horrified but he doesn’t see what the big deal is and their confrontations reveal cracks in their relationship. Meanwhile Carly is facing her own trials with husband Kent, expecting their child but worried he might not continue to find her attractive – how appearances are perceived is key for everyone. There is acting of exceptional quality from all four players. Tom Burke is the beating heart of the play as Greg, the catalyst for raging emotionality all around him as he impassively watches on but reminding us too, with some gorgeously subtle work, that he does have feelings too, deep ones. Siân Brooke – so very excellent in Ecstasy – continues her strong vein of work this year as Steph – incandescent with rage in the opening scene but subsequently slowly peeling back the layers to reveal the fragility and depth of emotion that lies at her heart: physically she just completely inhabits the character to stunning effect, her hands in the final scene speak volumes. Billie Piper is initially amusing as the tale-telling security guard, pregnant and increasingly worried about her ability to keep her husband’s attention and her scene with Burke’s Greg as she tries to force an admission about the infidelity she suspects is heart-stoppingly good, almost unbearably moving as her open features crumple under the weight of suspicion. And last but by no means least, Kieran Bew exudes unrefined masculinity as Kent, possessed of a swaggering cockiness and arrogance which utterly convinces."
1225,1225,Ought To Be Clowns,27/10/2009,Ian,Pains of Youth, National,"It is described as shocking and erotically-charged, which instantly means that it is neither of these things. Set in a Viennese boarding-house in 1923, a group of medical students negotiate the trials and tribulations of their sexually entangled lives, against the backdrop of the recently ended First World War. With an ever-revolving carousel of relationships and interactions, all are struggling to escape the disillusionment of their existence, but choose wildly different paths in order to achieve this. The six students and one maid make up quite a dislikeable bunch of protagonists, there’s a lot of self-indulgent flailing around and ridiculous posturing: “you only make love to your pain” being a personal favourite. This is not a problem in itself, but for the fact that their alleged decadence in their post-war malaise is really quite dull and I did not find it at all engaging, so I couldn’t have cared less about any of them. For all the promise of erotic charge, there was very little sexual chemistry on stage between any of the characters, only Geoffrey Streatfeild coming close to exuding the necessary magnetism for his cruelly manipulative Freder. The staging of the Viennese drawing room is quite traditional, given Mitchell’s pedigree, but where her influence is apparent is in the manner of the scene changes. The action periodically freezes onstage and besuited, futuristic Men-In-Black types appear to rearrange the sets, producing new props in little plastic bags and popping the props from the just-ended scene in bags as well before departing the stage and allowing the action to proceed. It is extremely random, but I thought it added a kooky sense of puppetry to the production, these actors on stage are just being manipulated by an unknown body, towards their ultimate destinies. However, there is an awful lot of this messing around with the plastic bags, and whilst the artier side of me could kind of see where they were going with this, the length it took to bag up every flower and teacup in the big scene change in Act 1 nearly drove me to just leaning over, grabbing one of the plastic bags and smothering myself so that I didn’t have to sit If the idea of people from the future putting on a fatally dull puppet show in which little of any interest happens, then this is the show for you. I couldn’t really tell what Bruckner (or Crimp’s) intent was in terms of story-telling: assuming this was the generation that was instrumental in allowing the rise of Nazism ten years later, the potential for an interesting look at the genesis of their complicity is surely there, but just not in a trite look at their bedhopping. Personally, I would save your money and look at your own plastic bags I had to wonder if the play would have worked better if Mitchell had used her live film technique in this production. I don't know if that would have saved it, or just served as another distraction from what was a fundamentally quite an undramatic piece. I wasn't keen on the constant 'turning their backs' to the audience that kept recurring. I wouldn't have wanted to be any further back than we were on the fourth row"
1226,1226,Ought To Be Clowns,26/06/2010,Ian,As You Like It, Bridge Project at Old Vic,"         We really are disagreeing a lot lately! Then again I haven't seen The Tempest yet, god help me… But I just couldn't get behind the wrist-slashingly depressing interpretation of the first half. The friend I was with asked me in the interval if I was SURE it's meant to be a comedy, which is never a good sign…"
1227,1227,Ought To Be Clowns,24/09/2010,Ian,The Rivals, Richmond Theatre,"One of my theatrical highlights of the year so far was Celia Imrie in a sparkling production of The Rivals which variously featured audience interaction, recorders, Beyoncé songs and Sam Swainsbury sat on my lap for a while. So, when the Theatre Royal Bath production to be directed by Sir Peter Hall was announced, I was intrigued to see how it would match up. And whilst there is little of the relaxed informality of that Southwark Playhouse version, Hall sticks to what he knows best, gimmick-free, perfectly-cast productions which focus on the writing. The Rivals is a comedy of manners, set in 18th century Bath amongst the fashionable élite who are there to take the waters and maybe a little gossip and romance on the side. Lydia Languish longs for a romantic elopement such as those of which she has read rather than a conventional marriage and so in order to win her hand, Captain Absolute disguises himself as an impoverished soldier and woos her, despite the disapproval of her guardian, Mrs Malaprop who has her own romantic designs. But Absolute has two rivals for Miss Languish, whose cousin has her own lovelife problems which we observe and the servants are playing their own games resulting in much comedy, chaos and confusion. I have to be honest, I didn’t think that Celia Imrie’s Mrs Malaprop could be bettered, that having been my first experience of the character and so my expectation level was accordingly not hugely high but Penelope Keith is pleasingly just wonderful as the vocabulary-chewing aunt (though I was a little bemused by the spontaneous applause as she arrived on stage). It is a much more quietly dignified interpretation, one really sees the woman behind the caricature and it is strangely moving, so much so that it lends the finale a really dark turn before her ultimate rescue. And paired with her old sparring partner from To The Manor Born, Peter Bowles, as an irascible but thoroughly equanimous Sir Anthony Absolute, they are a match made in heaven, bouncing off each other, glints in their eyes and a real sense that they are loving it up there. But fun as these two are, it is the swirl of characters of which they are a part that makes this play the delight that it is, a real ensemble piece in which everyone has an opportunity to shine. And it is a mark of just how well cast this production is that the performances across the board were just delightful. Tony Gardner is resplendent in purple satin and wonderful at capturing the all-too-human prevarication of the self-torturing Faulkner, full of guilt and suspicion yet much admiration of Annabel Scholey’s Julia who is marking herself as an interesting talent as she impressed as Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream even against Rachael Stirling’s stunning Helena and does well here at maintaining our sympathies without overplaying it. Making her professional stage debut (although familiar to fans of Survivors) Robyn Addison makes for a haughty but wry Lydia, clearly suggesting the intelligence behind the would-be romantic, connecting well with Tam Williams (also an alumni of the same Dream as Scholey) as a waggish Captain Absolute. But even in the smaller parts this production remains strong: Ian Conningham’s manservant Fag opens proceedings well with his gossipy summary of events thus far and a lovely genial manner and with Carlyss Peer’s Lucy, a maid on the make, demonstrate that it always pays to keep one’s staff happy. If I had to make one criticism, it would be that I would have preferred a little less mugging from Keiron Self’s buffoonish Mr Acres, given the subtleties throughout the production although given the audience reaction I was definitely in the minority on that. The set by Simon Higlett is most elegant, the backdrop suggesting the grandeur of Bath’s Georgian architecture without overpowering; Christopher Woods’ costumes look sufficiently opulent and the simplicity of the staging, there’s only ever maybe two pieces of furniture on the stage, works perfectly. I do wonder how this will translate to the rather cavernous Theatre Royal Haymarket but I hope they don’t change too much because in what may initially seem the most traditional and simple of productions here, emerges an evening of classic delight. I remember seeing Annabel Scholey in Troilus & Cressida and marking her down as one to watch. Glad you enjoyed it. I did too: a classy, well-cast, traditional production. And good to meet you, Sir! I thought the spontaneous applause for Ms. Keith was quite sweet; a gesture usually only reserved for Hollywood stars, no?! I’ve never seen even Dame Dench get that treatment…"
1228,1228,Ought To Be Clowns,24/09/2016,mag9l,Yerma, Young Vic,"It’s Yerma yes, but not as you know it. Australian auteur Simon Stone (best known in the UK for The Wild Duck but whose Medea in Amsterdam was just masterful) has revised, reshaped, rewritten Lorca’s 1934 tragic poem into an all-too-contemporary lament that throbs with the painful intensity of Billie Piper’s stunning performance here at the Young Vic. Encased in a glass box, the audience in traverse (designer Lizzie Clachan doing some extraordinary work), Piper plays Her, a woman in her mid-30s with a successful career as a blogger (I KNOW!) and happily married to the slightly older John. As the societal narrative goes, they buy a house and then decide to start a family but despite the fecundity of those around them, they struggle to conceive.  So what, you might say, in the modern world childlessness doesn’t carry the same negative baggage and there are more options available to resolve the issue. But what Stone does is to make us question the desperate need to have a child at the heart of play and who it is who actually applies this pressure – is it society (Lorca’s choric villagers are replaced by the online commentariat here) or is it internal, emotional, psychological. Stone weaves in a vein of black humour that establishes his modern world well – Maureen Beattie as the flinty academic mother, Brendan Cowell’s porn-fan husband, Charlotte Randle’s complex sister – they humanise the tragedy that you know is coming and are sharply funny with it. Which carries you through some of the bittiness of the production with its many short scenes and protracted timeline, Stefan Gregory’s sound also helping to mask some of the joins."
1229,1229,Ought To Be Clowns,02/09/2010,Ian,The Remains of the Day, Union Theatre,"You have to admire the ambition currently on display at the Union Theatre. Writing a new musical is hard enough at the best of times, but when your source material is a Booker-Prize-winning novel which has already had a much loved film adaptation made, then there’s quite a challenge ahead. But that is what Alex Loveless has taken on with his adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day. Telling the story of Stevens in post WWII England, a long-serving butler to the late Lord Darlington who is struggling to deal with his new American employer, he identifies the solution as being retrieving a former colleague from Cornwall, Miss Kenton. As he sets off on a road-trip to try and persuade her, he also goes on a journey through his memories of the inter-war period where we discover that his employer was uncomfortably sympathetic to the Nazis and that his relationship with Miss Kenton ran far far deeper than that of just butler and housekeeper. As Stevens and Miss Kenton, Stephen Rashbrook and Lucy Bradshaw are perfectly cast. Rashbrook displays the emotional restraint of a man who knows nothing aside from a life of servitude and dealt with transmitting this through the medium of song rather well (though there were moments when the sound drowned him out). As Miss Kenton, Bradshaw however is allowed to burst free from her emotional shackles occasionally, her playful scenes teasing Stevens over his reading material were joyous and her beautiful voice filled the Union perfectly, she is just excellent throughout. If anything, I wish the show concentrated even more on their relationship. The first half is mostly taken up with Lord Darlington’s politicking which I just didn’t find as engaging. Partly because the characterisation of Darlington was a little weak, but also because Loveless’ ballads and rousing ensemble numbers are much stronger than the upbeat songs that dominated here. Throughout the ensemble, there was not a weak link to be found performance-wise: Reuben Kate making an assured UK debut with two strong characterisations, two good accents and one powerful voice; Katia Sartini and Gemma Salter tugging at the heartstrings with their beautiful duet Close Your Eyes and Dudley Rogers impressing as both the frail Stevens Senior and a charming cameo as a friendly passerby later on. There’s a fair amount of dancing in the show and it is well executed throughout, the girls’ routine to ‘The End of the Pier’ was great fun. But to be frank, I did not feel that much of it was well incorporated into the production or indeed that it was strictly necessary. The representation of the passage of time through a series of dances was clumsy and the dance sequence inserted into the finale was badly placed, sapping the emotion from what should have been a highly moving ending. I would have placed the final dance section at the beginning of the finale thus allowing the vocal reprises to ratchet up the emotion through to the end. The staging was relatively simple, evoking the dusty grandeur of an abandoned stately home well, but the arrangement with seating on two sides and the band tucked away behind the far wall of the set means that the space in the Union is not utilised to its full advantage. The action is often pushed too far forward resulting in some blocking issues, one song had me watching the backs of six men for too long. The Remains of the Day is not perfect, but there are moments in here which are simply lovely. It is so nice to see a musical playing it perfectly ‘straight’ as it were, there’s no tiresome self-referencing or arch post-modern irony here, just a strong set of performances, an engaging central storyline and some lovely ballads. Saw the first show on Thursday, admittedly a preview, but you couldn't hear a word Stevens was singing. The band was far too loud and he was wasn't projecting at all.Not sure what to make of it really. Had no idea what to expect, and thought some bits worked but agree that it loses interest when not focused on the relationship. Really enjoyed this on Thursday and thought it had flashes of real brilliance.  So good I'm going to see it again in spite of some flaws. I'm intrigued! This show has got a  four star review from the Evening Standard  , a  mixed review from The Stage , and  an absolute stinker from the Financial Times.   The bizarre thing about the FT review, apart from being written by the Jazz critic, is that is was published date stamped before the preview (Thursday according to Anon 12.46 above).  Very strange! Have all these critics seen the same show?  I'll be able to form my own opinion when I see it next week. Went and saw this tonight. I would have to agree that at some points I wanted to find whomever was playing the flute or recorder or whatever wind instrument it was and forcibly remove it as it was drowning out some of the singers. On the whoe it was brilliant though. Was true to the book and yet still brought a little humour and the odd tear. A mixture of reviews is nothing unusual, just because there's a bad one doesn't mean excuses should be made: can't imagine the FT would fabricate a review.Am a fan of Lucy Bradshaw and very much enjoyed her, but as others have pointed out, Rashbrook is stuck between a rock and a hard place, he can't belt his songs out because he's supposed to be the epitome of repression but with the music is just ridiculously loud at time. Having the MD out of sight can't help with that.A 2.5 out of 5 for me. Thought most of the show was very disjointed. Songs slammed in for the sake of a song. Too many songs. Very male dominated. Would have worked better as a play. Annoying performance from an American character. Didn't buy a programme as didn't want to spend one pound on a few bits of A4. I thought on the whole that it was brilliant! Great music, great acting and a great set.Bad points: Some scenes were way too short but they did get to the point. Performances were all good except I do have to agree with the comment above, the American (Rueben Kay) really got annoying and it seemed he was in a different show to the others.4/5 The two fat men made me laugh. Was the director on crack when he put the choreography in? It makes no real sense in terms of the whole show.And having a lead woman who gets to sing just a song and a half in the second act is poor planning. Cripes, what a lot of comments!I do think that perhaps the show should have run with a few more previews before opening. That way, some of the issues could have been ironed out before opening night. But it is important not to forget that this is a brand new musical and as such will naturally evolve and respond to what works and what doesn't anyway. a flawed show, but one with serious potential. Second half stronger than the first. Several killer numbers, 'Close Your Eyes' and 'The Way That Once We Were' stood out. As a whole well worth seeing. First 10mins are the weakest. Looks like further into the run some tweaks have been made and some work done. Tonight no issues with the sound balance. Yes there still needs to be a bit of work here and there but nothing too major. I loved this show when I saw it at the weekend.  It has so much potential.  Hopefully someone with vision will knock it into shape to turn it into a muscial theatre classic."
1230,1230,Ought To Be Clowns,06/04/2013,Ian,Old Times, Harold Pinter,"I do try to have willpower, but sometimes it just doesn’t work. Having decided that I wouldn’t be going to see the revival of Harold Pinter’s Old Times, the announcement of Kristin Scott Thomas’ Olivier nomination crumbled my resolve and sure enough, I made enquiries into finding someone who would do me the kindness of day-seating. Part of the reason for not going was that I knew that if I had seen it once, I would want to see it a second time as Scott Thomas and Lia Williams alternated the two female roles of Kate and Anna throughout the run and I do like to complete a set. In the end, I was lucky and able to call in on some favours which meant I did get to see it two times in the last couple of weeks and from the vantage point of the front row which made it worthwhile as the quality of the acting was hypnotically good, from both actresses and also from Rufus Sewell’s Deeley. But Pinter has always been a playwright whose charms have eluded me and Old Times is as gnomic an example of his work as any and though I was glad to have been able to take in both iterations of the cast, I can’t say that it really added a huge amount to my understanding (or lack thereof) of the play. In their coastal farmhouse, husband and wife Deeley and Kate are chatting about the imminent arrival of her old friend Anna, but she hasn’t seen her for 20 years and he doesn’t recall her at all. What follows is a series of reminiscences as Deeley and Anna compete to remember Kate with the greatest degree of accuracy, fighting over details of trips to London exhibitions and the cinema and competing over levels of intimacy. Fighting over the past is their way of laying claim to the extremely passive Kate but as the battles of the play progress, it becomes increasingly clear that nothing is in fact that clear. The ambivalence that characterises so much of Pinter’s writing is in full force here but rather being entirely wilfully obtuse, the possibilities it opened up seemed intriguing to me in a way which was rather fascinating, both to discuss in the pub afterwards and also again when watching the second viewing. We’re never sure exactly who or what is real – they might all be dead, Anna might be the long-suppressed split personality of Kate, or she might be a fantasy figure dreamed up by the couple. So little is given away though that any interpretation that you care to spin onto Ian Rickson’s production would fit, and no-one could argue otherwise.  Sewell’s presence onstage remains constant in both versions, a pugnacious presence of decreasing certainty and dissolving masculinity and it was genuinely interesting to see how Lia Williams and Kristin Scott Thomas compared and contrasted in their different takes on the two women. Out of the two, I preferred Scott Thomas’ seductively absorbing take on Anna and Williams’ languorous enigma as Kate – both actresses seemed to feel more comfortable this way round and thus pulling out more interesting interpretations. (Though as this was the first way round I saw them, I wonder how much that was a factor.)"
1231,1231,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,V&V, VAULT Festival,"The business of conducting a love affair has alwas been particularly charged, as senses are heightened in the erotic rush and emotions brought closer to the surface. But in the world of romance and relationships, communication is key. Misha Pinnington’s V&V explores how even with a century of technological advancement, telling someone how you feel can be an absolute minefield. From the carefully composed letters between Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf to the scrolling message screen of the dating app on which Mia and Lottie meet, Pinnington compares and contrasts these love stories, asking what if anything has really changed for matters of the heart – lesbian, straight  or otherwise. And in her smartly directed production for Sprezzatura, it proves a deeply affecting and romantic experience.  On the face of it, these worlds couldn’t be more different. As members of 1920s literary royalty, Vita and Virginia’s missives to each other are erudite and eloquent expressions of an increasingly meaningful emotional connection. On the other hand, Mia and Lottie are fretting about being left on read, over how many kisses are too many, about when is the opportune moment to ask for nudes. Heather Wilkins (Virginia/Lottie) and EM Williams (Vita/Mia) both bring beautiful nuance to their pairs of characters, suggesting connections around levels of confidence, sexual or otherwise, but also delineating them well, Nicola Chang and Rachel Sampley providing further audio-visual cues with their respective sound and lighting design, switching us effortlessly between centuries."
1232,1232,Ought To Be Clowns,20/12/2018,Ian,Paddington 2 (2017),,"In a year when sequels have outperformed expectations (at least mine anyway), I should have heeded the signs that Paddington 2 heralded back last winter that sequels were ‘in’. Paul King’s follow-up to his 2014 warm-hearted original, reintroducing us to our ursine Peruvian hero, occupies a similar space of resolutely British family films that are a cut above.  Written by King and Simon Farnaby, the film is unafraid to take its audience seriously and for every adorably sweet sequence, there’s genuine peril and even darkness in there too. Hugh Grant is the main antagonist, an actor called Phoenix Buchanan who has been reduced to making dog-food adverts and his ne’er-d-well ways see Paddington framed for a crime he did not commit. Grant is hilarious as the hammed-up thespian but truth is he is just the jewel on the crown of a delightful piece of film-making. Erik Wilson’s cinematography is beautifully done, integrating the animation so seamlessly that it is easy to forget Paddington isn’t (shhh) real. And voiced by Ben Whishaw, he’s as appealing a bashful hero as you could ever want."
1233,1233,Ought To Be Clowns,18/02/2017,mag9l,The Wedding Singer, Curve,"Opening at Leicester’s Curve ahead of a 8 month long UK tour (dates and venue at the end of this review), you can see where Nick Winston’s production has made its key decisions – Francis O’Connor’s set has its eye on quick get-outs and so Jack Henry’s video projections do a lot of the heavy lifting in setting the 80s milieu. And the casting mixes West End reliability with TV name recognition, the cherry on the cake of course being Ruth Madoc. I still can’t look at Ray Quinn without seeing his murdering Scouse schoolboy from Brookside so his physicality now is even more disturbing, although suited here to his love rat Glen, and Roxanne Pallett does her best with flimsy writing as Julia’s best friend. Ruth Madoc as Robbie’s grandmother appears to be having the time of her life but only Samuel Holmes as one of Robbie’s bandmates manages to really break through in the supporting cast."
1234,1234,Ought To Be Clowns,19/03/2010,Ian,Hannah Waddingham, Live at the Chocolate Factory,"She’s such a natural performer and exudes a refreshing likeability that makes her almost impossible not to resist. Confidently covering all of these genres, this is a highly professional show with a number of highlights: ‘Send in the Clowns’ is naturally a treat, and it’s such a nice change having it sung by a strong vocalist. The only letdown was her not tipping me a wink as she sung the name of my blog, but I suppose I can forgive her that! Part of the fun of cabaret shows is this vast variety of songs that can make up the repertoire, but for me it is also one of the downsides. The connections come when you recognise the material, I loved ‘Don’t Rain On My Parade’ and even an unexpected ‘Thriller’, but on too many occasions, I was left scratching my head as I just haven’t seen many of the shows which have populated her career: Spamalot; The Beautiful Game; Lautrec. These other songs were still performed well, don’t get me wrong, but my lack of familiarity with them meant that they didn’t capture my attention in the same way. I’ve had pretty much the same experience at other cabaret shows I’ve been to and don’t seem to be learning my lesson, but I just find it hard to resist the opportunity to see performers whom I like in this kind of intimate setting. The band, under the musical direction of Chris Walker, were excellent and obviously have a great rapport with Waddingham. So I doubt many people will be disappointed if they go to any of the remaining shows: this really is a top quality show, it just didn’t  click instantly with me. The concerts are being recorded and a CD will be released later in the year which will give more people the welcome opportunity to hear these tunes, and for me to get to know them better so that I might retrospectively appreciate just how good an evening I witnessed. Thriller? THRILLER? I'm there."
1235,1235,Ought To Be Clowns,12/12/2009,Ian,Molière or The League of Hypocrites, Finborough,"Explicitly about the French playwright Molière, a huge success in the court of Louis XIV until his plays started to make an enemy of the Church, which devotes its considerable energies to discrediting him by any means possible and ruining him. The play then follows Molière as he struggles to maintain “his integrity under a repressive regime”, a point made all the more poignant by the fact that Bulgakov was writing in Stalin’s Russia, suffering much the same treatment and risking it all by writing such plays. Given the limitations of space, what this production achieves in terms of creating completely different atmospheres with the minimum of effort, and some beautifully judged costuming, was nothing short of miraculous: the shift from decadent palace to austere cathedral was particularly effective and Blanche McIntyre’s direction should be commended, although the use of Latin in the key final scene was a little alienating for those of us who did not receive a classical education. The acting was mostly strong: Paul Brendan’s turns as the court fool and Molière’s faithful companion were both effective and Gyuri Sarossy’s louche Louis XIV exuded just the right kind of playfulness and arrogance. Elsewhere I found the relative youth of much of the company a bit distracting and resulted in some miscast roles. And as the titluar playwright, I’m afraid I was a little disappointed by Justin Avoth who struggled to mine any of the requisite depths in order to engage us in Molière’s fate."
1236,1236,Ought To Be Clowns,16/09/2010,Ian,House of Games, Almeida,"The Almeida plays host to the world premiere of House of Games, a Richard Bean stage adaptation of David Mamet’s 1987 film Margaret Ford is a celebrated wealthy psychoanalyst working in Chicago but after allowing one of her patients to get under her skin, ends up compromising her professional reputation as she attempts to resolve his gambling debts and gets sucked into a world of tricksy cardsharps and handsome hustlers. She attempts to justify her actions by writing a book about this world but soon realises she is in way out of her depth. It is all good fun and nicely paced under Lindsay Posner’s direction as we whip through the series of events in 100 minutes without an interval. There’s lots in here to keep you guessing throughout, but there are a couple of moments where it resembles the BBC1 programme Hustle far too close for comfort, and those experienced in this type of thriller might be a little disappointed the way in which things go. That said, although I worked out what was going on, my companion remained unaware and consequently really enjoyed the revelations. It is a mystery to me as to why Nancy Carroll isn’t hugely famous yet. She has been on fire for the last few years in a chameleonic range of roles and is practically unrecognisable from her outstanding performance in After the Dance, but delivers another strong turn here as a woman swept completely off her feet by a handsome stranger and then thoroughly disorientated by the subsequent turn of events. She also pulls off some incredibly quick changes of outfit as she slips between her ordered, professional world and the unfamiliar underworld gambling terrain. I really enjoy watching Amanda Drew on stage, she is such an intriguing actress and I just wish there was more opportunity for her and Carroll to interact in this play as they work well together, and also Drew’s hair is just fabulous by the end of the show! John Marquez is really good as the dim as molasses Bobby and there’s also good support from Trevor Cooper and Al Weaver. Michael Landes plays the handsome seducer well but could do with working in a little more subtlety into Mike to give him the necessary depth to see him as more than just a conman. The set is well designed by Peter McKintosh, creating the titular sleazy den of the poker players, complete with well-stocked bar, but also adding a second tier in a cutaway stage above it for Margaret’s office. I’m wary of saying too much but the final quarter has been revised to lend it an even more twisty climax which I found effective and the classy cast give it their all to create an entertaining, if not quite as complex as one might have hoped for, evening. Hey you! I see the programme cost is £3. Does this mean you have one? Are you able to say if it's worth buying? Am wondering what it has in addition to the usual cast bios and ream of advertising."
1237,1237,Ought To Be Clowns,03/11/2015,mag9l,A Further Education, Hampstead Downstairs,"Right now, there’s more women onstage at Hampstead’s downstairs theatre than there are in the current and next main house shows (The Moderate Soprano and Hapgood, both written and directed by men too) combined – a sorry record indeed for any establishment. Which isn’t the note on which I intended to start this review of A Further Education (which is directed by a woman at least) but it’s something I wanted to say which I think needs to be recognised more widely. But to the matter at hand. A Further Education is Will Mortimer’s debut professional play and is something of a gentle comedy, its rather warm ideal ideal for these darkening nights. It’s the start of a new year at university and Josh and Lydia’s English Lit tutorial is blown open by the arrival of mature student Charlotte Swift. Seemingly an academic genius wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma, her insights even knock the socks off lecturer Chris yet try as they all might to get her to open up, Charlotte’s personal circumstances remain a closed book. In the bustling to-and-fro of Caitlin McLeod’s production, Stella Gonet is inspired casting as Charlotte, combining inscrutable gravitas with a youthful sprightliness that comes from far more than just her skinny jeans and Converse. Charlotte’s love of learning is infectious, finding kinship in Issy van Randwyck’s newly-installed Vice Chancellor and her curious enthusiasm but also in her younger undergrad colleagues, Josh and Lydia are perhaps keener on downing shots of Chartreuse and snogging in the quad but find something too in the greater intellectual rigour she brings to their discussion and thus their own work. "

1239,1239,Ought To Be Clowns,19/10/2015,mag9l,Lady Chastity’s Reserve, The Four Thieves Pub,"Not strictly speaking an escape-the-room adventure but very much in the same arena, Handmade Mysteries’ Lady Chastity’s Reserve is a raucous take on the live team game experience and with a bottle of wine, nay an aphrodisiac, up for grabs, it has the distinction of being the first of this type that our team of regulars actually completed (who knew the incentive of alcohol was all we needed!).  Located in the depths of The Four Thieves pub in Battersea (and a very nice pub it is too), Lady Chastity’s Reserve is a game for up to 5 players in which a series of puzzles, conundrums and clues have to be solved within the hour in order to liberate the final bottle of the “exclusive wine” for which she was famed. Guided by the idiosyncratic and slightly filthy-minded host Gabriel (who will offer up an assist or two when summoned), it’s all really rather good fun. I can’t say too much more for the mysteries of the room are yours to be discovered – suffice to say that the storyline is well-constructed and the ways in which the challenges are packed into the intimate space is ingeniously done. It is a small room so it quickly got rather hot, though Lady Chastity was thoughtful enough to introduce an air-con unit, and looking back we would have been better creating a little more working room for ourselves at one key moment (hint, hint)."
1240,1240,Ought To Be Clowns,24/04/2012,Ian,The Great Gatsby, Wilton’s Music Hall,"“’Whenever you feel like criticising anyone,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had’.” Fans of The Great Gatsby are being spoilt for choice this year as the passing of the rights of F Scott Fitzgerald’s novel into the public domain has led to a number of adaptations hitting the London stage. First up is an immersive adaptation at Wilton’s Music Hall (the 8 hour extravaganza Gatz arrives in June and a musical version plays at the King’s Head in August) and it’s proved to be a canny move as the entire run has sold out before it even opened, apparent testimony to the popularity of the book but I hope there is a swell of affection for Wilton’s at play too as they continue to raise funds for their vitally important reconstruction works. The palpably atmospheric history of the building lends itself to theatrical exploitation and Peter Joucla’s production makes the most of this from the off. Characters mill about the bar and foyer area and play out little scenes which locate us firmly in prohibition-era New York and escort us into the main theatre which has been bedecked simply but effectively in a sweeping, vaguely Art-Deco inspired design by Lucy Wilkinson. A barbershop chorus starts singing jazz tunes of the era and we’re off in this tale of the enigmatic Gatsby, whose hard-worn pursuit of the woman he loves is slowly poisoned by the decadence of the society around them both. NB This was the final preview performance. Oh, and I haven’t read the book. Yet. I found the first half to be quite charmingly enjoyable, if a little slow to really engage with my attention. The post-WWI but pre-Great Depression era is evoked well in the louche attitudes of the idle rich who hang out at Tom and Daisy Buchanan’s Long Island mansion – Vicki Campbell’s Jordan a stand-out here – and Nick Chambers’ new arrival, an old school-friend also called Nick, provides a neat outsider’s perspective, albeit as he is slowly seduced into this social whirl. When it emerges that the manor overshadowing Nick’s modest abode is owned by the mysteriously wealthy Gatsby, who holds party after party in the hope of enticing Daisy over to resume their abortive youthful passion, the scene is set for love and money to do battle once again. But truth be told, I never really felt the intensity of feeling that the story, as it came across to me, demanded. I wanted more persuasive charisma from Michael Malarkey’s Gatsby, more bubbling passion from Kirsty Besterman’s Daisy, only Christopher Brandon’s Tom really expounded the emotional charge I craved. The musical interludes, which recur with regularity throughout with their accomplished harmonies, set the tone at a slightly more whimsical level which, with the occasional cameos from stock 1920s caricatures and a school-party heavy audience with lots of hints of fancy dress, called to mind more of a Bugsy Malone atmosphere. This would be fine but for the second half which is eminently unsuited to the form. As events take an increasingly tragic turn, Joucla mis-steps horribly with a pair of death scenes that sit most awkwardly in the production. The first introduces an erroneous note of stylised theatricality, paired with a musical outburst that just feels wrong; the second forgoes both of these and fails limply with barely a splash. Thus much of the good work is undone, barely a note of genuine tragedy felt and the consequent ending fudged somewhat. It’s an inauspicious ending which casts an unfair light on most of what has gone before which is appropriately atmospheric, interestingly drawn and gently engaging.   Bizarrely, there were two (empty) seats reserved in your name last night too.   Were you once thinking of coming twice?"

1242,1242,Ought To Be Clowns,12/07/2018,Ian,If We Were Older, National Theatre,"Wowzers! I was hoping for an enjoyable afternoon catching up on some of the plays that were shortlisted for the National Theatre’s New Views teen playwriting competition, but I wasn’t expecting to be completely blown away by the one that was victorious. If We Were Older by Alice Schofield (a student of CAPA College, Wakefield) proves a more than worthy winner and absolutely, completely, worth junking your plans for late Friday afternoon so that you can catch its final performance.  On finally getting round to watching Patrick Gale’s Man in an Orange Shirt, I was left a tad disappointed in the conventionally linear way it explored its dual timestreams. And it is tempting to think that Schofield might have felt the same way, as as her characters Maggie and Daisy have a little contretemps on the tube, the fallout in which she explores each of their personal histories is beautifully commingled, their stories intricately entwined as we discover they’re so much more alike than they could ever know. For the look on Maggie’s face isn’t a stare of contempt but one of wistful longing. Now in her 70s, she can’t believe she’s living in a London where two teenage girls can be so open about their sexuality. Hers has been a lifetime of too much repression of her own lesbianism but as a young woman, there was a moment of true happiness, of blissful connection. And for all her contemporary openness, Daisy’s romantic history has proven far from straight-forward to date. Schofield’s writing demonstrates a real maturity here – playing the two timelines concurrently allows for an elegant fluidity that erases notional scene structure. Lines of dialogue begin in the past and end in the present, a thought from modern-day Daisy is finished by Maggie in the 60s, and everyone loses themselves in the freedom of dancing to pop music no matter when they’re from. Rachel Lincoln’s production runs with this elegiac sense of beauty, and Sadeysa Greenaway-Bailey’s design of ingeniously flexible suspended beams is as playful as it is nicely evocative of NY girders. "
1243,1243,Ought To Be Clowns,27/04/2015,mag9l,Everyman, National Theatre,"Starting quite literally with the Fall of Man, Carol Ann Duffy’s contemporary verse adaptation of medieval morality play Everyman sees Rufus Norris direct his first production since taking up the reins of Artistic Director at the National Theatre and finds him in a rather provocative mood. Through 100 minutes of boldly imagined drama, it’s hard not to feel that there’s an element of grabbing this institution by the lapels and giving it a good old shake. Not so much in establishing a definitive vision for the future per se but more in establishing just how wide its parameters will be.  Norris and designer Ian MacNeil work cleverly within the constraints of the Travelex budget to provide impactful moments with – variously – Tal Rosner’s video wall, a powerful wind machine, William Lyons’ music which combines shawms with Sharon D Clarke most effectively and bags of rubbish. Javier De Frutos makes a significant contribution too as choreographer and movement director, the wordless opening sequence of a coke-and-Donna-Summer-fuelled birthday party makes for a bold beginning. The story sees Chiwetel Ejiofor’s titular character reach his 40th birthday with quite the landmark – a visit from God, a marvellously sonorous Kate Duchêne, in the form of a cleaner and She ain’t happy. Mankind has been pissing away the multifarious gifts of life in pursuit of hedonistic pleasure and now it is time for a reckoning – She’s unleashing Death on Everyman, in the form of Dermot Crowley’s wonderfully sardonic Irishman in what must be a C&A suit, and Everyman will be forced weigh up all the good and bad deeds in his life. This he does by embarking on a personal odyssey, desperately hunting for family and friends to help him justify his life’s choices but it turns out they’re pretty thin on the ground and so the journey to self-realisation begins. Ejiofor is a hugely charismatic performer and the energy expended here is palpable as he ricochets from meeting to meeting, discovering how little meaning material Goods have, how little real Knowledge he possesses, how malnourished the Good Deeds of his life are."
1244,1244,Ought To Be Clowns,03/11/2011,Ian,Hamlet, Young Vic,"The Young Vic continues to be allergic to the idea of people just using the main entrance into the auditorium to take their seats: people who have booked for Hamlet have been advised to turn up 30 minutes early in order to take in the ‘pre-show journey’. But whereas withGovernment Inspector and Beauty Queen of Leenane, it was just being guided a different way within the building, here we are guided out of the theatre and taken round the back entrance to wind our way through the corridors backstage past some rooms which have been dressed up with non-responsive cast members sitting around before reaching the seats, it adds very little to the experience (aside from getting us wet on the way there) and ultimately seems a pointless exercise. The most remarkable thing about this section was that the gym had a massive sign that talked about rules for ‘Excercise’: someone at the Young Vic needs to get their spell-checker switched on. But to the play, labelled one of the theatrical events of the year as it features the return to the stage of Michael Sheen in what is Jerusalem director Ian Rickson’s Shakespearean debut. And as is often the case with such an oft-performed classic, an interpretation has been imposed upon the material to try and cast it in a different, and newly revelatory way. Once the seating area has been located, the uniformed orderlies, utilitarian grey carpet and circle of plastic chairs hint at what is to be revealed, as a ghostly prologue with Hamlet gazing on his father’s coffin before it is lowered into the ground, leads into the opening scene which takes place as if in a therapy session. For as it turns out, Elsinore is, I think, a mental asylum in the late 1970s and so the play takes on a new perspective on madness. I say new, I mean it borrows heavily from One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. Through a variety of ways, we come to see everything is happening in Hamlet’s head. Whether through the unambiguous notes of the arresting way in which the ghost is portrayed or the more subtle suggestions, the hints that maybe some of the characters exist only in Hamlet’s mind through some canny doubling and playing with sand, it is clear not everything is quite as it seems. It is an intriguing premise to be sure but one which didn’t really work for me. Too often it felt like square peg round hole syndrome with this conceit having been settled on and the text being wrestled to fit in with it, but more often than not it just didn’t make sense, some ridiculous contrivances necessary which I ultimately found most distracting – the production never felt natural in this respect. This was further exacerbated by the general sense that Rickson is imposing on Shakespeare rather than remoulding it. Preview issues aside, there’s a deliberate slant on the verse-speaking which was bizarrely stilted and interjected with pauses, robbing the text of both clarity and emotion, lines which should pierce the soul are tossed away. The restrictions of the concept also manifest themselves in Jeremy Herbert’s deliberately bland design which is over-reliant on the (initially) dramatic effect of heavy iron doors sliding shut as the place is thrown into lockdown again, and again: it all feels rather uninspired. By the time the giant sandpit of the mind is revealed, it was too little too late and even then it just didn’t work for me. I must admit to not being overly impressed by Michael Sheen’s performance. It may have been he suffered under the weight of expectation, but for me he also suffers under the weight of delivering this rather thankless interpretation. He is occasionally very strong, the sweaty desperation and mania comes across well best in a twisted take on The Mousetrap which is effective. But there’s a heavy-handedness at work here too, a desire to shock and confront – both the other characters and the audience – which robs much of the line-reading of any subtlety or poetry. And whether one considers Sheen to be too old or not, the main problem is that the show has not been cast relative to him especially with Sally Dexter – less than 10 years older – who is mis-cast as his mother, not only does she look a similar age, her physical deportment makes her seem even younger. And so their relationship never really convinced, the closet scene in particular felt very rushed, I never got the depth of emotion needed to touch the heart from this Gertrude. And to be honest, a good deal of the supporting cast left me underwhelmed and in two cases, most disappointed. Michael Gould’s Polonius was a bright light in being one of the few managing to create a convincing characterisation but it was Vinette Robinson’s Ophelia who was the one stand-out, the one performance that brought chills with a truly shocking transformation as she starts her decline. In something of a random coup, PJ Harvey was brought in to compose Ophelia’s songs and they’re very much of the White Chalk era, Robinson clutching an autoharp and distributing pills in place of herbs in an arresting visual that shocked me more than anything Sheen did. This is likely to be a divisive Hamlet: it split our group of four equally, two for and two against, and the audience also seemed torn, some people ovating, others applauding half-heartedly. I simply could not get past the muddled feeling of the over-riding conceit which for me, robbed the play of its humanity. If all we are watching are the delusions of a madman, then why should we care? The relationships lose their meaning, the epic tragedy scaled right down yet, at the same time the impersonality robs the material of any intimacy. There’s an awful lot of madness on display here, but precious little method. 'This is likely to be a divisive Hamlet: it split our group of four equally, two for and two against.' I'm not sure I would go so far to include me as a 'for'.  I'd say we had one who loved it, one who was bemused and thumbs in the middle (me) one who loathed it and yourself. It clearly is a divisive Hamlet, I  absolutely loved it and was blown away by Michael Sheen's performance, for me, the best Hamlet I have seen. In our party of four we had three strongly for and one teenage girl half asleep by the end… I agree that the hospital stuff is a pointless conceit and just distracting. My girlfriend was seeing it for the first time and was completely thrown as a result. Robinson is indeed fantastic. There were a few touches that showed up Rickson's inexperiences in this arena, but I really enjoyed the play as a whole and Sheen's performance too. I think the finest aspect was the violence and the dramatic expression, as if it were being loosed from previous, more hallowed performances. Your review is very accurate – not a good Hamlet. We were only two and neither of us was at all impressed – indeed we would have left if we could have!  "

1246,1246,Ought To Be Clowns,26/05/2011,Ian,Hamlet! The Musical – Richmond Theatre,,"It’s Hamlet, but not as you know it. Originally an Edinburgh Festival hit in 2001, returning in 2010 and now developed under the auspices of the Royal & Derngate to a fully fledged hour and three quarters production, Hamlet! The Musical takes a delightfully irreverent look at this Shakespearean classic in an adaptation that is highly inventive, supremely silly and one of the funniest things I have seen this year. Where it succeeds is in some really sharp writing, there are plenty of genuine laughs in here alongside the broader comedy, and the engagement of a highly enthusiastic and talented cast of familiar faces. Jack Shalloo’s (recently very good in The Kissing Dance) daft teenager with stars in his eyes makes a very appealing leading man and Mark Inscoe’s (huge amounts of fun in Salad Days) doubling as an Elvis-inspired ghost and a devilish Claudius were both excellently good. But almost stealing the show are the others in the company, covering several of the smaller roles each and Jess Robinson and Gabriel Vick had me in stitches with nearly every appearance. Robinson’s feisty Ophelia is probably as good a reading of the role as I’ve ever seen, Vick’s Euro-inspired Laertes is a scream and together, their back-up ghosts and particularly their Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were just inspired. This ensemble works so well together and it means that unexpected pleasures come from all angles: I’ve never laughed so much at Fortinbras as played here by David Burt and Virge Gilchrist’s boozy Gertrude’s relaying of the fate of Ophelia and Polonius to Laertes is another hilarious moment. But for a show that is nominally so silly and clearly born out of the irreverent Edinburgh festival atmosphere, there is a genuine musical intelligence at play here that elevates this into something special (interestingly one of the writers, Alex Silverman, is responsible for the jazz makeover of the King’s Head’s Coronation of Poppea). It is through-sung but every song is an integral part of the story-telling, there really is no filler here and this allows the range of influences from which they draw inspiration from to shine through, whether it’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern via Avenue Q’s Bad Idea Bears, the astoundingly brilliant Die Fledermousetrap which incorporates numerous famous operatic tunes or the show-stopping Act 1 closer ‘(The Question Is) To Be Or Not Be’ – a song that could seriously win Eurovision. It isn’t absolutely perfect, close as it is: for a show that relies so much on the wit of its lyrics, there’s a few too many instances of multiple vocal lines that muddy the clarity of the words and given the vast scope of the humour, the constant recourse to Shakespearean in-jokes began to undermine just how clever so much of the comedy is here – danceoffs, deaths by giant herring and the book Regicide for Dummies notwithstanding. But these were minor quibbles in what was a hugely entertaining evening that really does combine silliness and genuine wit in the best way, complete with a score that is engaging and interesting and in the case of ‘To Be Or Not To Be’, a solid gold musical hit that will linger in the mind for days to come! I would the chance to see this. "
1247,1247,Ought To Be Clowns,22/03/2019,Ian,The Bay at Nice, Menier Chocolate Factory,"Oh, British theatre and your ongoing obsession with David Hare. I’ve never really got it, never had that experience with one of his plays that made me go ‘oh that’s what they’re talking about’. Indeed, I only really booked for The Bay at Nice for the opportunity to see the Great British wonder that is Penelope Wilton in the intimacy of the Menier Chocolate Factory. And such is her exceptional talent, that she almost makes this an unmissable event. Her Valentina Nrovka is a strikingly captivating presence, a former pupil of Matisse called to authenticate a painting that might be one of his. Having left post-war Paris for revolutionary Russia, her artistic career has taken a back seat and motherhood has not proved anywhere near as fulfilling."
1248,1248,Ought To Be Clowns,22/03/2014,mag9l,The A-Z of Mrs P, Southwark Playhouse,"There’s a sense of budding potential in new musical The A-Z of Mrs P that doesn’t quite come to full fruition in this production at the Southwark Playhouse, but suggests that some assiduous rethinking and re-shaping could well see any future life be more bountiful. Diane Samuels’ book and Gwyneth Herbert’s music and lyrics tell a self-described “musical fable” inspired by the autobiographies of Phyllis Pearsall, the woman who mapped out and created the A-Z Atlas to London. But though this may be her main claim to fame, the rest of her life was full of additional drama too. A Hungarian map-drawing father and an Irish mother who ultimately died in an asylum, her parents had a troubled marriage which impacted hugely on her and her brother’s childhood and beyond, and her lovelife was marked by failures and an abortive marriage. All of this and more is packed into the show which strains under the pressure of delivering any of its narrative streams effectively. The process of mapping the streets of London, inspired by her getting lost on the way to a dinner party, is fascinatingly done in Sam Buntrock’s production and matched with some of Herbert’s best work here, lyrical invention and jagged musical phrasing creating real interest. But the use of flashbacks to dip into Mrs P’s childhood, and to give flashes of her parents’ own careers and lives saps the show of its momentum as they steadily become the focus at the expense of the title character. Fortunately, they are performed compellingly by the reliably experienced hands of Michael Matus and Frances Ruffelle who draw these characters vividly, as does Stuart Matthew Price as brother Tony (the duet he and his sister share ‘Can You Hear Me, Mama?’ is just lovely). Peep Show’s Isy Suttie is an interesting choice for Mrs P by comparison – she captures her quirky, almost gauche nature in the first half just right, but feels out of her depth in the later emotional turmoil."
1249,1249,Ought To Be Clowns,30/06/2012,Ian,The Tempest, RSC at the Roundhouse,"Last up in the RSC’s Shipwreck Trilogy, in the What country friends is this? season was The Tempest. In some ways I wish I’d seen this closer to The Comedy of Errors and Twelfth Night (which I saw on consecutive days in June) as the thrill of watching an ensemble across multiple plays is magnified much more that way. As it was, my enthusiasm for The Tempest – never one of my favourite Shakespeares and now totally ruined by the fact that I’ve now seen what will probably the best version ever –  had waned slightly as I returned to the Roundhouse. The reality was neither as bad as I had feared nor as good as I might have hoped. David Farr’s production (I wish they’d gotten in a third director to really mix things up) has its moments of  inspiration and interest, but these are scattered throughout rather than invigorating the whole show and so my abiding feeling was of unevenness. For the great visual impact of Prospero having the islanders dress in identikit suits, little is done to enliven the immense amount of speechifying that the character does, Jonathan Slinger’s performance having a strangely unnerving impact more than anything. What I have liked across these plays is the emergence of performers of note. Kirsty Bushell, an actress I already liked, has really risen to the challenge of leading roles and even in a supporting part here – a gender-switched Sebastian – she does interesting work. And Bruce Mackinnon and Felix Hayes have really nailed genuinely comic business, their affinity for working together apparent across all three shows and I look forward to catching them in future productions, hopefully spreading their wings beyond the Bard. "
1250,1250,Ought To Be Clowns,05/11/2013,Ian,Secret Theatre 3, Lyric Hammersmith,"Where shows #1 and #2 of the Lyric Hammersmith’s Secret Theatre season maintained complete radio silence about their content (even if certain critics weren’t able to hold off revealing titles at the interval…), it seems that the efforts of keeping things mysterious have gotten a little too much. Secrets are still thrillingly in store for other aspects of the show but clues are being offered for #3 right up front on the website, strongly hinting that the death penalty is something to do with the production. And so it proves, Caroline Bird’s new play Chamber Piece is an unremittingly dark piece of writing, set in a near-future where capital punishment has been reintroduced to Britain. But Bird wants to look at what happens when it goes wrong, as we witness an execution that doesn’t follow through and the ethical and practical mess that emerges in the aftermath. Can the state try again to kill someone for whom they have a death warrant? Should they?"
1251,1251,Ought To Be Clowns,12/07/2013,Ian,Dusa, Fish,"There’s something of a contradiction with Pam Gems’ 1975 play Dusa, Fish, Stas and Vi. Labelled an early feminist classic and nominated as one of the top 100 plays of the twentieth century, it has since languished many a shelf and rarely been seen. Naturally it falls to the West London powerhouse of the Finborough to give it a long overdue revival but though Helen Eastman’s production gently highlights how many of its issues remain so pertinent today and is indeed excellently cast, it cannot disguise its dramatic slightness. Part of it is intentional. Gems’ style was deliberately filmic, cutting between short scenes and skimming across the potential depth to her characters at the expense of focusing on the major events. So in this slice of life from a tiny shared apartment somewhere in London, we experience the trials of newly separated Dusa whose husband has run away from the divorce papers and smuggled their children away to Argentina, the self-assured Stas who is funding her dream of studying marine biology in Hawaii by working on the game, Vi’s emotional fragility is symptomised by her anorexic tendencies and the highly politically aware Fish can’t quite get over the fellow campaigner who is breaking her heart. In just giving us the top slice of all these stories, Gems does avoid this becoming an issue-driven play, instead sketching a vivid portrait of the messy complexity of lives of women who were somehow challenging the status quo at a time when genuine change was increasingly a possibility. And with its episodic structure, there’s a fast-moving, almost sprawling quality, punctuated by strong emotional beats. Tortured mother Dusa gets most of these, Sophie Scott fiercely intense especially mid-panic attack, along with lynchpin of the group Fish, Olivia Poulet in a wonderfully measured performance that slowly unravels throughout the play. But the hazy lack of detail also frustrates. There’s little to suggest the reason that these four women are actually choosing to live together either in the play or in the performances. Emily Dobbs – reminding me of a young Eve Best – is marvellous as the pragmatic deadpan Stas and Helena Johnson milks some good laughs as Vi starts her recovery, but it is hard to see their emotional connection to the other two ladies. And when the play makes a late stab at dramatic gravitas, the situation feels both scarcely earned and too abrupt. "
1252,1252,Ought To Be Clowns,05/06/2012,Ian,Volcano, Richmond Theatre,"There’s always a danger, when delving into the realms of rarely-produced works by playwrights in the hope of unearthing of a gem, of forgetting that there are often good reasons why some plays gather dust on a shelf even whilst others are regularly revived. It is currently Noël Coward’s turn to have his back catalogue exhumed, in the form of this touring production of the 1956 play Volcano but though it is an addition to Coward’s oeuvre that might be appreciated by completists, it can hardly be said to be a salutary contribution to his legacy.   The warning signs are there: the play was never performed in Coward’s lifetime (programme notes suggest it would have been too frank for the censors but the play didn’t even get that far as it was turned down flat by his producer) despite being written nearly 20 years before his death and came at a time when he had just become a tax exile, having moved to Jamaica amidst a cluster of colonial celebrity chums whose intrigues could well have inspired the events of seen here. Set on the volcanic (natch) South Pacific island of Samolo, in and around the house of widowed Adela Shelley, we follow the lives and loves and romantic entanglements of a louche group of Brits. Ellen has come to stay with Adela, who is being pursued by Guy, whose wife Melissa turns up and snubs Ellen, who then decides to pursue Guy in revenge. Oh, and the neighbours on the banana plantation next door keep popping round. And the volcano keeps rumbling in anticipation of an eruption. But it is an eruption that never comes, dramatically speaking at least. The pace is sluggish throughout, director Roy Marsden does little to conceal that this is mostly scene after scene of people sitting around chatting, which wouldn’t be quite so bad if the dialogue wasn’t so flat, even criminally boring in places. There’s precious little cutting humour, no satirical commentary on the blinkered way of life here, just endless meanderings about mules and coffee and a terribly shoe-horned-in revelation of bisexuality (though fans of awkward male wrestling might approve). Simon Scullion’s set of an open veranda is perfectly functional but unwisely tries to recreate a tropical volcanic mountainside at the rear which just look incredibly cheap and artificial. And it is an artificiality that seeps into a large proportion of the cast, whose stiff mannered English-isms rarely transform into convincing drama, just Finty Williams breathing a little warmth as one of the neighbours and Dawn Steele lending Melissa an icily compelling presence. As something of a Coward 'completist' I maybe got more out of it than most customers, but the lead casting of Jenny Seagrove (aka 'Mrs' Bill Kenwright) is unpardonable.  Biggest laugh of the night was when she delivered the line ""but, darling, I'm 44"".  I don't think Miss Seagrove has been 44 this millennium … or if so, only just 🙂 I couldn't think of a better word than completist, but honestly if it hadn't had had Coward's name on it, I can't imagine you'd've given it the time of day."
1253,1253,Ought To Be Clowns,13/06/2011,Ian,The Flying Karamazov Brothers, Vaudeville,"The Flying Karamazov Brothers are four entertainers, dressed in kilts, who have moved into the Vaudeville Theatre for the summer with their cabaret show of juggling, comedy, dancing, comedy dancing and music. The troupe has impressively been going since 1973, and still has one of those original two members performing now – Paul Magid (also writer and director), developing a number of shows and expanding their numbers to enable shows to run simultaneously in different cities. Not usually a fan of juggling-based shows, I have to say my mind was completely opened to new possibilities by Gandini Juggling’s Smashed! last year which demonstrated how interesting and indeed beautiful it could be. There are moments of thrilling juggling which are breathtaking in their scope, as the four men play with the sounds and rhythms that they create, and weave in and out of each other, exchanging batons at a whirling rate and never pausing for breath during the routines. The best of these comes towards the end with what they call jazz juggling, a free improvisational segment which sees them cutting loose and challenging each other with a more playful air of tricks and flicks that is highly engaging and fun: it was so good, it almost overshadowed the much-trailed juggle of 9 Objects of Terror that followed it at the end of the show. There’s an awful lot besides the juggling in the show too, despite the relatively short running time, as the guys move into variety with mixed success: a ballet routine is most amusing as is the moment when they play as an ensemble using each other’s hands. But the patter that fills the gaps doesn’t really work, the shoe-horning in of topical references is too forced and simply unnecessary, they are funnier and connect more with the audience when they stick to the culture-clash jokes and encourage their participation by trying to find three objects to try and defeat their juggling champ. And it has to be said, though the quality of the performances were generally good, the second half was marked with a number of errors as three of the juggling routines featured dropping more than once. Matters were exacerbated by it being painfully obvious in two of them: the first one in the dark with illuminated balls leaving nowhere to hide as they tumbled to the floor and the finale, involving a member of the audience standing in the midst of flaming torches being tossed around, was genuinely nail-biting as the element of danger was ramped up but again, things fell to the ground."
1254,1254,Ought To Be Clowns,18/06/2005,Ian,Songs of Innocence, South Bank Centre,"Tori Amos’ 4 songs were a personal highlight, getting to hear ‘Silent All These Years’ and ‘Winter’ from Little Earthquakes was amazing, plus ‘Pretty Good Year’ and ‘Mother Revolution’ added up to an emotionally wrenching and intense set. Sinéad O’Connor was much more low key than expected,  a gently-strummed guitar backing a murmured, even placid collection of numbers of which only ‘Scarlet Ribbons’ really made the impact I wanted from her. Beth Orton’s endearing goofiness made her brace of songs highly engaging, returning later to deliver ‘Dolphins’ exceptionally well, and Marianne Faithful commanded huge presence especially with a scorching version of ‘Working Class Hero’. Eliza Carthy and Kristin Hersh counterpointed each other beautifully with folk songs from either side of the Atlantic; Smith’s own contributions rocked, including a sensational rendition of ‘Birdland’ off her seminal disc Horses; and we were blessed with readings from the gorgeously mellifluous voices of actresses Miranda Richardson and Tilda Swinton. Even a bizarre interlude from Yoko Ono somehow worked for me, though I was probably more excited just to have been able to see her live without having to go through a whole show’s worth of her unique brand of randomness."
1255,1255,Ought To Be Clowns,17/11/2018,Ian,Fanatical, Playground Theatre,"Matt Board and Reina Hardy’s new musical Fanatical taps into the apparently unstoppable rise of comic-book culture, but takes a refreshingly uncynical slant on the subject, particularly where its fan-base are concerned. The notion of comic cons full of cosplaying superfans might leave you cold but as we discover here, they’re places full of potential and meaningful interaction for kindred souls – is it really so different from a pub full of grown men all dressing up in the same football or rugby shirt…? This particular comic con(ference) is for the fans of comic book-turned-TV show Angel 8, but the organisation of it has been far from smooth sailing for uber-fan Trix. She’s worried that the show’s creator might not make it to the venue, and is ill-prepared to deal with his idiosyncratic ways once he does. There’s also rumours of an undercover reporter in the crowds, penning a hit piece on the easy target of geeks. And along the way, there’s many a life lesson to be learned, by us as well as them.  There’s a huge deal of affection laced through Fanatical which makes it an enthusiastically warm-hearted show to watch. Director Grace Taylor has her cast really embrace their characters and thoroughly embody them in all their quirks. So for every geeky or nerdish trait, there’s a rationale, a chance to understand that the act of making a costume is a labour of love, that learning reams of trivia is just like being able to reel off football stats, that the mere act of coming together with like-minded people is so powerful, no matter the cause.  "
1256,1256,Ought To Be Clowns,22/01/2011,Ian,Double Falsehood, Union Theatre,"Well it is not so much desolation that can be consumed at the Union Theatre in Southwark but rather the first professional production of the play Double Falsehood since 1792. It is most notable for being a play that was controversially included in the Arden Complete Works of Shakespeare last year despite its provenance being hotly debated. As it is understood in this Clown’s mind, Double Falsehood is a 1727 adaptation by Lewis Theobald reportedly based on a 1613 play called Cardenio by Shakespeare and John Fletcher (who also collaborated on Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen). There’s reams of debate and scholarly concerns about this but ultimately, it should not be allowed to detract from what is an interesting production here. Set in Andalucía around the court of Duke Angelo, whose youngest son Henrique causes a whole world of trouble when he rapes and abandons servant girl Violante and then decides to pursue and marry Leonora who just happens to be betrothed to his friend Julio. The fall-out from these events sees everyone scattered, themselves and their families left behind distraught, throughout the local countryside and it is left up to the noble older son and heir of Angelo, Roderick, to round everyone up and reunite lovers, parents and children and ensure that justice is served in the Spanish hills. Willmott’s production takes a pared down approach to ensure that proceedings are impressively pacey. Javier De Frutos’ design likewise is spare but successful: costumes suggest the laid-back elegance of the 1950s and the monks’ habits used in the more pastoral second half added to a highly atmospheric setting with chanting and bell ringing going on all around the audience (the finger-licking shepherd was a step too far for me, but I suspect that it says more about me, rape and slapping is ok but finger-licking right in front of me? No!) Jason Meininger’s lighting worked well with little lanterns being my favourite touch and the combined effect was to really utilise the idiosyncracies of this converted railway arch venue. Standout performances for me were Gabriel Vick’s wronged and passionate Julio and Emily Plumtree’s Leonora who was also beautifully spoken with a natural ease in the intimate space of the Union. They have a palpable chemistry which convinced from the outset which made their respective descents into madness and nunhood all the more powerful. Jessie Lilley coped admirably with the difficult part of Violante with her relentless pursuit of Adam Redmore’s spoilt playboy, who could probably done with one or two less manic laughs, but did well at suggesting the psychological torment wrought upon her. Sam Hoare brought a nice maturity to the older son who and his quietly commanding gravitas was nicely reflected in his stage father, Richard Franklin, as Duke Angelo. As for the Shakespeare connection, well there are certainly moments in the text where one thinks ooh this could be him and the dramatic conventions used, like cross-dressing and people wandering around and finding redemption in the wilderness, also puts one in mind of the Bard. But it does feel like something different at the same time, I loved the cliffhanger into the interval and missed the comic touches which would have made the play into a bona fide tragicomedy and the sheer paciness means that less opportunity for real insight into a number of the characters."

1258,1258,Ought To Be Clowns,20/02/2013,Ian,Bull, Sheffield Studio,"Travelling from London to Sheffield to see a play that is 50 minutes long may seem close to madness but playwright Mike Bartlett is someone whose work I would happily go far to see and so there was no doubt that a day-trip to see Bull would be on the cards. I actually caught a rehearsed reading of the show at the Finborough a couple of years ago, so I knew the ballpark it was in – more the blistering intimacy of Contractions and Cock than the epic sprawling grandeur of 13 and Earthquakes in London – and with a top-notch cast being directed by Clare Lizzimore in the studio space at the Crucible, expectations were high. And this production certainly met them. Bartlett locates Bull in a tense office environment where three members of a sales team are awaiting a meeting with their boss where one of them is going to get fired. The atmosphere is clearly survival of the fittest and it soon becomes apparent that Thomas lacks the killer business mindset of Tony and Isobel and in a brilliantly sustained barrage of bullying and mindgames which last the entire duration, they systematically dishearten, deconstruct and destroy their target. Leaving us in no doubt of how vicious the intent is, Lizzimore places her protagonists in a boxing ring – excellently designed by Soutra Gilmour with the audience sat and stood on all sides, complicit spectators recognising that beyond the hypnotic horror of the aggressors toying with their prey, Bartlett has hit on an undeniable truth of human nature. As Eleanor Matsuura’s Isobel prowls around the ring, jabbing at Thomas’ weaknesses with surgical precision and Adam James’ brash Tony epitomises the type of chest-baring corporate arrogance that delights in belittling the weedy, it is Darwin’s theories brought to life and it is hard to root for the guy who is on the back foot from the beginning."
1259,1259,Ought To Be Clowns,23/01/2018,Ian,Austen the Musical, Bread and Roses,"Making a visit to London in the midst of a UK-wide tour, Rob Winlow’s Austen the Musical is a rather low-key affair but one which has moments of delicate beauty. It takes a biographical slant on the novelist’s life, focusing on the apparent sparseness of her romantic affairs and how, if at all, this impacted on the richness of her writing, concerned as it was with love and romance and marriage. It’s a slight concept to rest a show on, given the inherent nature of fiction writing, but one which grows in strength the more it relies on its central performance. Edith Kirkson is full of warm personality and gentle charm as Jane, her heart variously open to the variety of suitors that alight at her door yet never distracting from the free-flowing creative spirit that eventually scored a hard-won publishing deal. Winlow’s book both invents potential partners and draws them from real life but director Timothy Trimingham Lee’s decision to have the same actor play them all is a neat trick, portraying different facets of contemporaneous masculinity and suggesting the stifling way in which societal rules hemmed it in. With that in mind, Jenni Lea-Jones is good fun indeed as Jane’s Bennet-like mother."
1260,1260,Ought To Be Clowns,25/02/2018,Ian,Dust, Soho,"If you don’t laugh, you’ll cry. Given that Milly Thomas’ one-woman show Dust is centred on a young person’s suicide, there’s a surprising amount of humour contained therein. It’s of the darkest, most mordant kind of course, but it does mean that the emphasis of the writing skates a little close to the surface. Alice decides to end it all but when she wakes in a hospital, it turns out she hasn’t succeeded quite how she wanted. For though she is dead, she hasn’t passed on and is forced to observe the aftermath of her decision to end her life, bear witness to the impact it has on her friends and family, the loved ones left behind.  As she moves between her grieving parents to boyfriend already shagging someone else, the pole-axed best friend to the stand-offish nature of her aunt, Thomas clearly revels in these pin-sharp instant characterisations and embodies their varying reactions with real skill, a mix of the obliquely funny with the heart-rendingly sincere. Alice herself though remains a little too much of an enigma. Her frank and fearless sense of humour is wonderfully delivered but as a deflection from the uncompromising bleakness of the depression that blighted her life and caused her to end it, it leaves a little too much unsaid. That said, part of this is our own fault, our innate craving for neatly understandable endings."

1262,1262,Ought To Be Clowns,14/09/2016,mag9l,A Streetcar Named Desire, Royal Exchange," 
The thing is, if you’re going into a Sarah Frankcom/Maxine Peake collaboration with any notion of it being traditional, then more fool you. The pair have worked together several times (notably on The Skriker and Hamlet) and are clearly interested in advancing their creative vision, undoubtedly a feminist one but equally excitingly, an utterly adventurous one. So to label their take on Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire gimmicky is reductive, to bemoan its lack of specificity narrow-minded, to characterise its colour-blind casting thus a fucking disgrace. FYI Cavendish, if the actress playing Stella had been white, they still wouldn’t have been “related”, it’s called imagination. Having got that off my chest, I should say that this is a remarkably intense Streetcar and it is one that requires dedication throughout its 3 hours+ running time, Frankcom’s key conceit taking its time to play out as Peake charts Blanche DuBois’ startling decline in the New Orleans abode of her sister Stella and her virile but violent husband Stanley. Uprooted from any over-riding sense of particular time and space, Fly Davis’ design has a strangeness that takes some getting used to, its expressionistic flourishes framing some stunning imagery. And this increasingly hallucinatory atmosphere is played up by the presence of Creole figures that haunt Blanche, floating around the edge of her consciousness more and more as her anxieties increase. Peake makes her Blanche a harder, flinter woman than perhaps you might have seen before, a choice which has interesting dividends. It makes her a more striking figure to begin with, real grit mixed in with her Southern charm but it also mutes some of her innate tragedy which, dare I say it, is perhaps a little overplayed as the walls cave in at the end."
1263,1263,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,On Your Head Be It, London Horror Festival at Old Red Lion,"There’s nothing quite like being smacked around the head by the brilliance of a theatre company and that was my experience the first time I saw Out of the Forest Theatre with their striking take on the story of Lizzie Borden – Bury the Hatchet. So of course I was delighted to find their newest show popping up as part of the London Horror Festival at the Old Red Lion. Written by and starring Joseph Cullen and Sasha Wilson, On Your Head Be It – A Cautionary Tale is the story of a couple trying to enjoy a bit of holiday in deepest Wales, a break from the old routine. After a rocky journey there and a few bottles of sauvignon blanc have been downed, it soon becomes clear to what extent Stuart and Eleanor are no ordinary couple though. For the way they get their kicks is in a spot of murder here and there and in Eleanor’s case, everywhere. So Stuart has taken them to the gateway to Snowdonia but even there, temptation isn’t too far away. And as this macabre comedy unfolds in this delightfully lo-fi production from Rosa Crompton,  it is pushing their relationship to the brink. "
1264,1264,Ought To Be Clowns,01/10/2013,Ian,Handbagged, Tricycle,"Moira Buffini’s Handbagged started life as a short play as part of the Tricycle’s Women, Power and Politics season back in 2010 and now, in a fully fleshed out version, it returns to Kilburn to imagine the relationship that might have existed between two of the most significant British women of the last century – the Queen and Margaret Thatcher. But much has happened in the meantime, not least Peter Morgan having a huge success with a play that also depicted the relationship between monarch and Prime Minister(s) and the small matter of the death of the UK’s first female head of government. Perhaps conscious of the impossibility of trying to envisage what was really said between the pair,  Buffini opts instead for a meta-theatrical fantasia and huge fun it is. Older incarnations of the women (Q and T) interact with their younger selves (Liz and Mags), each giving us their own take on Thatcher’s reign through the weekly meetings held with the Queen, whilst two actors play any number of supporting characters – Reagans Ronald and Nancy, Rupert Murdoch, Neil Kinnock, a simple palace footman, the list goes on… As one of them recounts an event, the others pass comment, challenge memories, offer explanatory excuses, even break entirely out of character sometimes.  It’s an ambitious project for sure but one which sparkles with wit and playfulness. It doesn’t pretend to offer any great psychological insight, how could it, but it does examine the way in which history, particularly political history, is reported and remembered, how the myth relates to reality (or not as the case may be) and how the force of personality can ride roughshod over even the most deeply felt voices of protest. Buffini nails her colours to the mast pretty early on – the Queen would love to enjoy a girlish gossip but a profoundly respectful Maggie is stridently intransigent ad nauseam – but the lively spirit of the writing, even as it touches on the darker times of the 1980s, should ensure interest across the political spectrum. Indhu Rubasingham directs the whole affair with a keen sense of sharpness, maintaining clarity even in the more tangled scenes, and encourages some simply extraordinary performances from her cast. On first glance, these are impersonations par excellence – Marion Bailey nails the vaguely blank public façade of today’s Queen and Stella Gonet’s blown-dry helmet mounts the rigid stateliness of the latter-day Baroness. Clare Holman is appealing as a younger monarch but Fenella Woolgar is simply outrageously good as the fresh-into-power Thatcher – the walk, the head-tilt, the relentless drive, the absolute self-confidence, it’s all there in spades and should most definitely be seen by all."
1265,1265,Ought To Be Clowns,29/05/2013,Ian,Passion Play, Duke of York’s,"The trio of recent major Peter Nicholls revivals is completed with this West End run of Passion Play. But where Privates on Parade and A Day in the Death of Joe Egg thoroughly charmed me with their insights into his back catalogue, this play felt much less like a vibrant piece of interesting theatre and more of a dated portrayal of marriage and infidelity which, despite its technical innovation, emerges as an awkward example of middle-aged male wish fulfilment (credit to @pcchan1981 for coming up with the phrase!). This is somewhat compounded by the direction of David Leveaux which brings a lascivious, almost voyeuristic sheen that feels way too retrogressive for this day and age. Which is a shame, as there is much to enjoy here as well, not least in the sumptuous luxury of Zoë Wanamaker and Samantha Bond playing the outer and inner voices of the same character. That woman is Eleanor, who finds her marriage of 25 years to James, Owen Teale and Oliver Cotton taking on the two sides of this man, challenged by the arrival of the seductive and much younger Kate. And through the device of the alter egos, we see how the corrosive onset of infidelity affects this couple both publicly in their interactions but also privately as their innermost thoughts are given voice. It’s an initially intriguing device. Cotton confirms the assumption that our internal monologues are much funnier than our outward selves and contrasts well against the angst-ridden Teale, calling into question just how genuine his anguish might be. And Wanamaker’s exquisitely painful unravelling is further expressed by Bond’s eloquent frankness. As the play progresses, the boundaries between the selves become increasingly blurred but to no substantive effect than to muddy the narrative clarity, perhaps overcompensating for the lack of any real meaningful insight. More problematic is the character of Kate. Annabel Scholey saunters excellently as this predatory sex kitten who has a history of chasing married men, but as Nicholls denies her an inner voice, there is no complexity to the role, no investigative depth. Matters are then exacerbated by Leveaux treating her as a sex object with some of the most gratuitous stage nudity I’ve seen for a long time, sadly reinforcing the shallowness of the writing of someone who is meant to be a key driver of the action of the play."
1266,1266,Ought To Be Clowns,20/03/2014,mag9l,Away from Home, Jermyn Street,"Can culture capture society at a tipping point? Looking at theatrical representations of football in London, the Bush, the Royal Court and now the Jermyn Street theatres have all put on plays dealing with the (sometimes) thorny issue of homosexuality in football suggesting that we might be ready for a change. But then last weekend saw torrid rumours of a Premiership footballer about to come out to a Sunday paper followed by wanton accusations, hasty denials and the ongoing childish obsession with whether the game can ‘cope’ with a player being open about his sexuality. Previously seen last year in Manchester and now embarking on a UK tour, Rob Ward and Martin Jameson’s Away From Home takes a slightly different look at the subject, taking the form of a one man show focused on male escort Kyle. He may be out to his friends and family and thoroughly accepted as one of the footy-mad lads down the local but his professional life remains a secret, something which is tested when he is first hired by a well-known footballer, and then subsequently finds himself falling for him. Onstage for just over an hour and skilfully inhabiting all of the characters who appear in Kyle’s tale, Ward’s performance really is something to behold. The cocky swagger of the rent boy mellowing into something infinitely more moving as Kyle comes to realise the depth of his feeling; the repressed emotion of the footballer who knows that there’s no way he can ever be fully honest; the father who struggles to hide his disappointment in the son he barely knows. Ward whips through them all, and more, with clearly defined precision and often with a keen sense of humour. For though the overarching subject matter may be weightily huge, Away From Home is really at heart just about a mismatched love story and is suffused with comedy. There’s a real joy in how the thing that appals Kyle’s best friend McQueen the most, when he finds out what is going on, is that the footballer plays for their bitter rivals; the banter in the pubs and at the ground is well observed; and there’s a cuteness, and sexiness, to the way the relationship between the two men progresses from a transaction into something more meaningful. Perhaps ironically, the one or two moments that fall flat are the moments when the references to homophobia in football become explicit – the requisite Fashanu reference and the indictment of FIFA’s choices for the next two World Cups feel a little crowbarred in, their points too heavily made when the subtle quality of the writing means it isn’t really necessary here. It is more effectively explored as the subtext here – a recognition that though it is significant there are no out gay male players, people’s sexuality has no bearing on their ability to kick a ball."
1267,1267,Ought To Be Clowns,03/02/2011,Ian,Antonioni Project, Toneelgroep Amsterdam at the Barbican,"Featuring the return of Toneelgroep Amsterdam to the Barbican, Antonioni Project is another multimedia extravaganza from the Dutch theatre company who blew many, including me, away with their six-hour Shakespeare epic, The Roman Tragedies. Under Ivo van Hove’s direction, they have built up a sterling reputation as one of the leading European companies with their innovative blending of film-making techniques into more traditional theatre and creating a whole new theatrical experience for the audience. This work pulls together three of Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1960s films, L’Avventura, La Notte and L’Eclisse, with their common themes of couples struggling to reconcile notions of love with the reality of sex in a changing world that they feel estranged from due to their extreme materialism. The narratives of the three films are mixed, with characters from each interacting, I’d recommend reading the programme beforehand whether you know the films or not just to give you a bit of context that will prove invaluable. With a large team of technicians sited in an ‘orchestra pit’ where the first couple of rows of seats usually are, the company use a vast range of techniques, including split-screen, blue-screen, hand-held cameras and steadicams to portray the stories, which are beamed live onto a screen above the stage, sometimes in large format onto the stage curtain, sometimes there’s just live acting and no film work at all. By varying the ways in which the material is both filmed and presented throughout, there is always something to capture the attention. It does have to be said though that there are moments where it does get a little overwhelming, a little difficult to figure out where your attention is best served, especially sat near the front as we were. There’s a constant tension between the live acting and the screened video but occasionally, the filmed shot would be actors reacting to an off-screen conversation which is being surtitled, but with the two (or sometimes more) different sets of actors in front of you ‘acting’, it was hard to resist watching them work. Ultimately this is an issue for any surtitled production though, the additional perspectives just making it a bit more noticeable here. As a play, it was a little challenging to find a way into the material. With its cast of languid characters full of ennui, swanning round on yachts and at parties, avoiding the reality of the world around them and constantly nipping round the corner for a quick bonk with the nearest person, it did seem a little remote. But as we progressed, there was an air of quiet tragedy that emerged, of these people unwilling (or maybe incapable) of changing, of finally managing to find emotional fulfilment, that became quite moving. Hans Kesting (winner of the 2009 Best Actor fosterIAN no less) did not disappoint, reining in his natural charisma as the self-absorbed Giovanni, Marieke Heebink tugged at the heartstrings as his wife Lidia (in a gorgeous black dress) desperate to regain the emotional connection she once shared with him, Janni Goslinga pulled double duty as the mysterious flighty Anna and the not-so-mysterious flirty Giulia and I also enjoyed the furtive affair between Roeland Fernhout’s Sandro and Hadewych Minis’ Claudia, her declarations on being proprosed to were gorgeous."
1268,1268,Ought To Be Clowns,20/07/2014,mag9l,Shakespeare in Love, Noël Coward Theatre,"I can’t lie – I had rather low expectations when it came to the stage adaptation of Shakespeare in Love, not helped by rewatching the film recently and marvelling at how it managed to win 7 Academy Awards back in 1999. But I equally have to admit to being swept away by Declan Donellan’s production of Lee Hall’s adaptation which is set to open this week at the Noël Coward Theatre, it managing to find an identity of its own (after a relatively slow start) to try and recapture the hearts of audiences anew. Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman’s original screenplay saw Shakespeare as a jobbing playwright, tussling for commissions with friendly rival Kit Marlowe and dealing with a particularly sticky case of writer’s block. With his unhappily married wife and kids sequestered in Stratford-upon-Avon, he embarks on a forbidden affair with noblewoman Viola de Lesseps, who has her own battles to face in being denied the career on the stage that she craves and being married off to the obnoxious Wessex. Their romantic strife thus provides the creative spark for Will to write Romeo and Juliet. Where the film did work for me was in the overload of Shakespearean puns worked into the script, often wittily suggesting that the bard took inspiration from all around him; where it did not was with the central romance which lacked any real sense of passion for me. Funnily enough, the converse was pretty much true here. Tom Bateman’s freshly appealing Will and Lucy Briggs-Owen’s hugely characterful Viola have enormous chemistry and theirs is a romance to root for. Instead, the repeated gags of references to other Shakespeare plays prove to be something of a hindrance, occasionally interrupting the flow of the show –(the ‘out damned spot’ bit takes way too long of a set-up although the payoff is fun) – and often falling flat. Without them being cleverly worked in (like ‘tomorrow’ ‘and tomorrow’), they lose their impact, Will just declaring ‘oh brave new world’ as he schtups Viola doesn’t really mean anything at all. Equally, the delayed John Webster joke flew over the heads of the majority of this particular audience! Fortunately there’s much more to the production as well. Paddy Cunneen’s highly atmospheric music is sung and played live onstage, Nick Ormerod’s inventive design allows for both the intimate and the grand, and the brightness of the supporting cast – David Oakes’ twinkle-eyed Marlowe, Ferdy Roberts’ Fenniman, David Ganly’s Burbage and Paul Chahidi’s Henslowe just to name a few, give real life to the Elizabethan theatrical world."
1269,1269,Ought To Be Clowns,06/04/2012,Ian,Uncle Vanya, Minerva,"Opening the season for Chichester’s 2012 Festival, celebrating its fiftieth anniversary no less, is Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya. Roger Allam stars in Jeremy Herrin’s production in the Minerva studio, which utilises a translation by Michael Frayn but given that it is barely a week since I saw and adored The Print Room’s production of the same play, the bar was raised really quite high for this one. But setting productions up against each other achieves little and though my preferences ended up in West London rather than West Sussex, one can appreciate that perhaps they are attuned to different audiences. Chekhov’s tale of a man who has spent most of his working life as the steward of his late sister’s Russian country estate but is thrown into inconsolable desolation at the realisation that he may well have wasted his life in servitude. The gloomy atmosphere pervades to encompass all the residents of the house and matters are exacerbated with the arrival of ex-brother-in-law Serebryakov, with his glamorous, much younger wife Yelena. His plans and her presence rouses the beginnings of some response but lifetimes of inaction and repression prove hard to shake off for all concerned. The pace in Herrin’s production feels markedly sedate throughout, Frayn’s translation often has a lugubrious feel to it which stretches out over long passages and seemingly influences the performances. There’s little sense that there was ever much dynamism in this household: Dervla Kirwan’s Sonya is a muted, almost too subservient presence, Alexander Hanson’s Astrov never hit the mark for me and Anthony O’Donnell and Maggie McCarthy are sadly underused as the supporting comrades. Allam is able to transcend this at key moments, coming across with a fiercely self-mocking characteristic which is much less avuncular than the title might suggest. He wrings painful comedy from the merest of actions and successfully mines the pathetic desperation that follows his abortive attempt at action. But I’m not sure I got the whole sense of the man that might have been, he says these things but I never truly believed him, my feeling was that his time had well and truly passed. Other key players are aged upwards to keep the balance between the characters right, but it does shift the dynamic of the play a little too far. Lara Pulver’s Yelena consequently becomes a little too old to be truly convincing as she is and I generally didn’t care for Timothy West’s aged professor who lacked the careless callousness to push through his plans."
1270,1270,Ought To Be Clowns,07/03/2018,Ian,Glitter Punch, VAULT Festival,"Oh I haven’t wanted to walk out of a show this much in ages. In the best possible way, you understand. The relationship at the heart of Glitter Punch is a thing of absolute wonder, as written by Lucy Burke and acted so damn well perfectly by Emily Stott, I just didn’t want it to end. And if I had walked out, it would have been a happy ending for everyone and everything would have been golden. But life is rarely like that. And when the punch to the gut comes – and by God is there a punch to the guts, two in fact – the weight of the world comes crashing down and you’re left re-evaluating everything you’ve just seen. The little details that didn’t quite jibe, the inconsistencies that felt a little odd, things you barely noticed suddenly become clear. The certainties you held, thrown up in the air as they’re uncompromisingly tested.  As a tale of first love in Salford (not the nice part, the rubbish bit), Glitter Punch is highly engaging. The first in her family to go to college, Molly is a wonderfully mardy soul who can’t quite believe her luck when she meets the brooding John in the smoking corner. He’s moved up from London, he’s the sensitive type, he even wears nice shoes (gotta love a man in nice shoes) and flirtation over lighters soon turns into romance. Burke writes beautifully about the trials of teenage life – the external inarticulacy that belies rich emotional lives bursting to get out, the consequences of a lack of decent sex education, that innate craving to love entirely and completely. And in Stott, she finds a wonderfully empathetic performer who celebrates Molly’s glorious northern bluntness and insecurities without ever condescending, bouncing emotively off of Anthony Fagan’s faintly hipsterish John who rarely has much to say."

1272,1272,Ought To Be Clowns,08/06/2010,Ian,Romeo and Juliet, Actors Church Covent Garden,"So my second Romeo & Juliet in a central London (but off-West-End) venue in a week but whilst this is a modern dress Romeo & Juliet, it wisely leaves alone from much else tinkering. Set in the grounds and gardens, and finally inside, The Actors Church otherwise known as St Pauls Church in Covent Garden, this is a fresh, thoroughly honest and intimate telling of this familiar tale by Iris Theatre which offers a beautifully direct connection to the material. Fierce from the outset, there’s bottling, punching and flick-knives by the dozen, the opening brawl leaves many of the cast spitting (fake) blood and covered in plasters and bandages for the rest of the show: there’s little holding back from the brutality of the violence endemic in this family feud. But likewise, there’s no hiding from the depth of emotion here as well; this production contains a pair of central performances in an utterly convincing portrayal of teenage lust and passion. There’s a wonderful use of the nooks and crannies of St Pauls, a surprisingly calm environment enclosed on all sides by tall buildings and the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden. The audience is seated on benches for the longer scenes, but occasionally we wander to different areas to witness a rave in a garden complete with Bonnie Tyler dance routine, or snoop on the lovers in their hammock in a shaded corner, or in a brilliant moment, watch Juliet as she emerges in the window of one of the adjoining houses for the balcony scene. Then as we approach the final scene, we are invited into the church itself and it is a breathtaking moment: lit by hundreds of candles and a striking large blue neon cross, the air laden with incense, the bodies of Juliet and Paris laid on the altar, it is incredibly effective and atmospheric and demonstrates a superbly sensitive understanding of the opportunities provided by this venue. There’s also a nice level of audience interaction, some people get their name called out as part of the guestlist for the Capulet masque and some people are prevailed upon to dance at the party; at the balcony scene, Romeo stands amongst us looking up and converses with us. It all adds to the intimacy of the performance, the haunting strains of Irish lament She Moved Through The Fair sung by different characters at different points just adds to the atmosphere. As the star-cross’d lovers, Sam Donnelly and Laura Wickham are just superb, both turning in accomplished performances: Donnelly has a great gift for engaging with the audience, oozing charm and a natural affability that is impossible to resist and Wickham has just the right level of playful girlishness balanced with the growing awareness of the gravity of her situation. Their first meeting is played beautifully with the partygoers around them stuck in slow-motion as the lovers succumb to their first kiss: they are both gorgeous which helps, but the way they play the transformation of their teenage lust into something much more real and moving is a sight to behold, I reckon they are two names to watch out for. Domenico Listorti is also outstanding as a Russell Brand-inspired powerfully crazy Mercutio who is laugh-out-loud funny from the word go and painfully poignant in the refusal to accept complicity in his own death. Even with a cast of 14, there’s some doubling up here in order to cover all the roles but it is done in quite an inventive way. Matthew Mellalieu opens the show as the variable Capulet, kindly at first but unafraid to use violence against anyone and quite the menacing figure, but then midway through he emerges as the kindly Friar Lawrence and turns in a sensitive, barefooted performance and continues to switch constantly between the two. Likewise, Robert Pearce starts off as the Prince, raging against the brawling nobles of his city but then quickly dragging up as the Nurse and pulling off an audacious, outrageous interpretation which has no right to be as powerfully moving as it is. Looking a little bit League of Gentlemen in a short wig and sensible long skirt and jacket combo which is probably from BHS, this Nurse is bawdy, highly flirtatious (she gets a real eyeful of Romeo in his boxers!), breathlessly flapping about and screeching for Simon Kent’s hapless Peter and it is often genuinely hilarious. So when the discovery of Juliet’s body comes, the pendulum of grand emotion swings heavily the other way and it is a heart-rending moment. But there really isn’t a weak link in this ensemble and they do particularly well at demonstrating the unbreakable sense of camaraderie within these groups of men, one gets an inkling of why they believe “an eye for an eye” when brotherly love is this strong and it makes it all the more tragic. Plus you get to see someone give Romeo a wet willie which is possibly the only time I’ve ever seen this happen on stage! ON a serious note, their commitment to the performance was astounding despite, or maybe because of the inclement weather, Tybalt’s body lay out in the rain for ages, several actors worked barefoot, Juliet threw herself about in the mud, it just made it all feel even more real. Special credit should go to the staff who shepherded us around quickly but kindly and who quickly erected marquees and dried off seats as it bucketed down, little touches like that help no end to improve the experience and when the spectacle on display is as good as it is here, then you will surely not be disappointed: book now for a unique central London treat. I'm not so sure that this play was a grand success. Although the director obviously did a good job in transforming Shakespeare into panto, some of the cheap shots involved for quick and easy laughs just rang too jarringly in my ears. I say this especially in regards to Mercutio who, although there is possibly some gay subtext in the original, was transformed into the camp, gay, queer, fag villain of the panto piece. As soon as he came on, we heard the shriek and wail, as soon as we saw him, he was brandishing a condom packet and then some vaseline and then a used condom. Perhaps it's unfair for me to comment since I left very quickly – but it seems necessary, for the sake of the Nation's sexual health, to point out that latex condoms and the oil-based lubricant vaseline are not compatible. And only 20% of gay men have anal sex, as estimates give. These were cheap shots for cheap laughs. Now I say all of this because I believe it highlights an important point. Romeo and Juliet, produced in rep with Wind in the Willows, is always going to attract a younger audience. Indeed, as the reviewer above points out, ""some people get their name called out"" – in this case whole schools. Personally, I wonder whether the director can really raise his head high and say that having his audience guffaw and gasp over such ""villainous"" gay behaviour for the sake of cheap laughs is a good education. As a gay man in my 20s, I thought that such ""direction"" was left in the 80s. And for all of those school children there, what good does it do to see everyone else laughing hysterically at a gay man – and without reason. This is the salient point: if it made sense or added anything, I would be able to see why the director made the decision. In this case, there was little benefit. Except that he could smile and know the audience were enjoying themselves with the biggest laugh of the night when Mercutio kissed Romeo. A man. Kissing. Another. Man. Vilify him!"
1273,1273,Ought To Be Clowns,01/11/2012,Ian,Victor/Victoria, Southwark Playhouse,"It is sad that the Southwark Playhouse will have to quit its current London Bridge premises as it has hit a vein of real good form allied to a growing understanding of how best to use the converted railway arches and particularly so with this creative team, who have made this the hot venue for musical theatre on the South Bank, challenging both the nearby Union and Menier Chocolate Factory. Following on from rapturously received productions of Parade and Mack and Mabel, director Thom Southerland has turned his hand to a new adaptation of musical comedy Victor/Victoria. With a book written by Blake Edwards for his wife Julie Andrews, lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and music by Henry Mancini and posthumously completed by Frank Wildhorn, the show on paper isn’t necessarily that distinguished. In 1930s Paris, English soprano Victoria Grant is struggling to get a job but a chance encounter with Toddy, her instant gay best friend, thrusts her into the limelight as he hits on the idea of Victoria pretending to be a female impersonator and so Count Victor Grazinski is born, taking the cabaret scene by storm and causing all kinds of sexual confusion as men find themselves irresistibly drawn to this enthralling new performer. But though the story may be a little flimsy, its plot turns contrived, its sexual politics somewhat dated, there is a genuinely good heart to this production. The plea for tolerance, equality, the freedom to love whoever we want – man or woman and to not have to live life hiding one’s true identity in the shadows can never be heard often enough, and it is given real currency here with Anna Francolini’s expressive passion and Richard Dempsey’s charismatic warmth. Francolini’s Victoria is the woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman and is beautifully tender in sketching out the troubled emotional journey of a performer determined to perform, but not quite oblivious enough to the effects on her emotional wellbeing. And she’s sheer perfection in the cabaret sequences, a vibrant, compelling presence and incredibly vocally assured. As her partner in crime, Dempsey transforms camp pal Toddy into something infinitely more moving. Still possessed of some of the funniest wisecracks you’ll hear for a long time, he plays up Toddy’s eruditeness and displays a heart that is just as full, and deserving, of longing."
1274,1274,Ought To Be Clowns,29/05/2014,mag9l,Fings Ain’t Wot They Used T’Be, Theatre Royal Stratford East,"Lionel Bart’s highly tuneful score has been well refreshed by Elliot Davis and augmented with additional Bart numbers (the most notable, and notorious, of which is Living Doll) so it is frequently a joy to listen to. And Nathan M Wright’s choreography has a delicious energy which the company deliver well. But as dated stereotype follows thoroughly outmoded attitude, it becomes increasingly hard to feel nostalgic for such a time. Terry Johnson’s production asks us to swallow levels of camp and female submissiveness that frankly have no place in our culture. When the pendulum finally, briefly, swings the other way, it is too little too late really, the damage already done in pandering to a state of affairs that ought to have been much more fully indicted. The show is well performed though – Mark Arden’s (anti-) hero is good as the gangland hoodlum wanting to reclaim former glories, Jessie Wallace ideally cast as his strident lover Lil, Christopher Ryan’s fading burglar an amusing sidebar, there is certainly enjoyment to be had here. But as for whether it is a period piece ripe for revival or a relic of the past that should be left to collect dust, that’s for you to decide. "
1275,1275,Ought To Be Clowns,10/05/2017,Ian,Escape the Theatre, Millbank Tower," The premise of Escape the Theatre is that you’ve been invited to a swanky film premiere and as we enter the auditorium for an exclusive pre-film event, the lights go off, the doors are locked and a decades-long mystery is unveiled. There’s a lot to get to grips with and just 45 minutes in which to do so in order to, dun dun duuuuh, escape the theatre. All the previous games we have done as a team have been exclusively for us, which brings with it the natural advantages of knowing each other’s strengths and (hopefully) communicating well. This game is designed for up to 30 people across 2 teams so it can produce a different dynamic if you haven’t booked your slot exclusively. It’s not necessarily good or bad but it meant that we were working with people we had only just met (who had been split from their friends on the other team), and in some cases who arrived late and so we didn’t actually speak to at all outside of the game.  Thus it became a different kind of challenge for us, about teamwork with strangers which made for an entertaining if slightly odd experience. The number of puzzles, logic exercises and clues to find is really quite substantial and so it is nigh on impossible to get a full picture of what is going on, yet you need at least a couple of strong characters who are able to join all the key pieces together in order to make sure that the problem-solving is all connected. And because there’s no social area to congregate in afterwards, the post-mortem we had (this time over rhubarb gin) was limited to our own experiences – it feels like a missed opportunity not to allow this kind of communal sharing after making it an integral part of the game."
1276,1276,Ought To Be Clowns,20/09/2015,mag9l,The White Feather, Union Theatre,"It is perhaps a tacit admission of the complexity of the timeline (1914-2006) of new musical The White Feather that it is explicitly spelled out in the programme, each song accompanied by its time and place which isn’t always abundantly clear from the production, directed by Andrew Keates. Ross Clark and Keates’ book has an admirable scope in trying to draw together narrative strands around cowardice in the Great War, the condition we now know as post-traumatic stress disorder, female emancipation, closeted homosexuality, the comparative merits of Ipswich and Paris… but in this short space of time at the Union Theatre and with insufficient clarity, can’t quite do them all justice. The main story focuses on sixteen year old Suffolk farmer lad Harry Briggs (a suitably petulant Adam Pettigrew) who enthusiastically signs up for the army in 1914, pretending he’s three years older in order to make the cut, but who is soon emotionally brutalised by the horrors of war and the inability of the armed forces to recognise the problem. Executed for cowardice, like over 300 other Allied soldiers, it is left to his sister Georgina (a focused Abigail Matthews) to embark on a lengthy fight for a posthumous pardon, one which also traces her own journey through the troubled times of a country at war and a society in the midst of great upheaval. This involves her managing the local estate as the local landowner, David Flynn’s achingly repressed Adam Davey, leaves her in charge – Davey coming to play a hugely significant part in the lives of both siblings – and dealing with the village folk from dismissive society ladies to conscientious objectors. There’s much in here that works well but there’s just so much material that few of the stories get the chance to really breathe and build up the emotional charge that they deserve. Clark’s swirling score for piano and strings (led by Dustin Conrad from the keys) also initially struggles in the constraints of this episodic format but as the show progresses, its beauty is allowed to be fully expressed. What emerges as the main theme of ‘Set Them In Stone’ is an exquisitely elegiac tune, pre-echoing early on and then woven through the fabric of the show throughout in different forms and exploring the British folk music tradition, rousing full company numbers like ‘Fire and Glory’ and ‘It’ll All Be Over By Christmas’ have great impact elevated by Anthony Whiteman’s choreography. Additional songs have been contributed by Matthew Strachan which may well account for a certain inconsistency in style but when it results in powerful solo numbers like Katie Brennan’s rousing ‘I’ll Tell You What I’m Fighting For’ and Lee Dillon Stuart’s impassioned ‘In No Man’s Land’, it works."
1277,1277,Ought To Be Clowns,25/05/2015,mag9l,The Beaux’ Stratagem, National Theatre,"It may be The Beaux’ Stratagem but it is Mrs Sullen’s play. The most striking thing about Simon Godwin’s production of George Farquhar’s final Restoration comedy is its determinedly proto-feminist stance as Mrs Sullen – an independently wealthy woman now desperately unhappily married – is given surprising agency to express herself in a meaningful way and attempt to extricate herself from her situation. And in Susannah Fielding’s superbly silken performance, she’s exquisitely played as an almost tragicomic figure, endlessly entertaining in the raucous romping around but as Jon Clark’s lighting picks her out at the end of each act, capable of holding the entire Olivier theatre’s hearts in her hands. The beaux ain’t too bad either. Farquhar’s plot centres on their attempts to marry into money after squandering their fortunes in London. Hoping news of their disgrace hasn’t reached the provinces, they head north and stop off in Lichfield, pretending to be master and servant, where their attentions fall on a rich young heiress and her unhappily married sister-in-law. Samuel Barnett’s Aimwell and Geoffrey Streatfeild’s Archer are a witty pair of fellows indeed, with a cracking line in beautifully cut overcoats too, as their avaricious adventures are soon overturned by amorous attentions as they can’t help but fall head over well-turned heel for their marks. Life is never that simple in a Restoration comedy though and our beaux must do literal and metaphorical battle with the likes of Jane Booker’s Lady Bountiful, Chook Sibtain’s dashing highwayman, Lloyd Hutchinson’s eagle-eyed landlord, Amy Morgan’s appealing barmaid, Timothy Watson’s would-be chansonnier of a Count and many more beside, in Lizzie Clachan’s handsomely appointed set which does an effortless and effective job of quickly switching between the two key locations. And everyone has to do battle with the outrageously scene-stealing brilliance of Pearce Quigley as the ale-swigging, man-kissing, trifle-inspiring servant Scrub, whose every utterance is to be cherished."
1278,1278,Ought To Be Clowns,18/07/2013,Ian,The American Plan, St James Theatre,"Perhaps with an eye to the crowded marketplace that is London theatreland and trying to find a niche for itself, the St James Theatre has taken to transferring in productions, providing a mid-sized space for shows like Finborough transfer London Wall, Northern Broadsides’ Rutherford and Son and now The American Plan, fresh from the Theatre Royal Bath. Some of the risk may be mitigated this way but the choice of play remains equally important and with Richard Greenberg’s 1990 work, I’m not so sure they’ve hit on a great success. David Grindley first directed this play in New York in 2009 and clearly enamoured of it, has returned to the show and assembled an excellent cast to do so, not least Diana Quick, Doña Croll and Emily Taaffe. And he undoubtedly encourages some marvellous performances from them and the men of the cast, Luke Allen-Gale and Mark Edel-Hunt, but it just never struck me as a play that was worth reviving – it’s heavy-handed, tonally confused and ultimately for me, just not engaging enough.  Set in the sixties in a luxurious holiday camp in upstate New York, a wealthy German/Jewish mother and daughter pass the time on the fringes of the resort but when handsome journalist Nick and his dripping torso burst into their lives, their uneasy equilibrium is disturbed. For mentally fragile heiress Lili is a college dropout and champing at the bit for greater freedom from fierce mother Eva who guards over her with an imperious hauteur. Nick soon works his way into Lili’s affections but as we are left questioning how genuine his motives are, it gradually becomes apparent that both Lili and Eva have their own reasons for directing the course of this relationship. Quick’s Eva is quick-witted and deftly manipulative as she keeps us guessing as to just how much – if any – maternal concern governs her behaviour. And Taaffe is excellent as the pained Lili, so caught up in her fantastical take on life that we’re never sure just how cognisant she really is until too late. Allen-Gale as the picture-perfect American Nick matches up well with Taaffe in portraying young people trying a little too soon to act as adults and a late addition to the cast, Edel-Hunt’s Gil who complicates the sexual dynamics of the piece considerably whilst dazzling all with his preppy charm, is also strong."
1279,1279,Ought To Be Clowns,26/05/2011,Ian,Silence, RSC at Hampstead,"My continued failure to resist booking plays I don’t really fancy but with members of the RSC Ensemble in the, resulted in this trip to the Hampstead Theatre to see Silence, their collaboration with Filter, a company whose work I haven’t really enjoyed in the three shows of theirs that I have seen. And even the assertion that it was the Ensemble members I was keen to see is stretching it a little (although Katy Stephens and Christine Entwisle were both people I wanted to see again) as it was the opportunity of gazing at Jonjo O’Neill and Oliver Dimsdale onstage that finally won me over: as Monica Geller once said, ‘homina homina’. At its simplest, Silence follows two main narratives as a married couple pursue different paths: Kate travels to Russia to find Alexei, a man with whom she had a passionate affair more than 20 years ago; and her documentary filmmaker husband Michael with a sound technician colleague is investigating a mysterious Met Police unit whom they suspect of committing misdeeds. But this is a far from simple show as we flow seamlessly between both time and place, some scenes overlapping and even being intercut with one another. This means that the scope of the play is almost cinematic in its depth and fluidity as Thatcherite oppression is counterpointed with modern-day Russian capitalism and the way in which individuals and mindsets are repressed by both the state and themselves as the very nature of freedom is investigated. Filter’s work is primarily based around their soundscapes though, and so it is here with a dazzling array of technical expertise visibly on display as sounds are created from often unexpected places. The devised nature of the play does mean that one is left wishing for a little more character development and coherent story-telling as the creativity and ingenuity is channelled elsewhere so that style over substance is the phrase that comes quickest to mind towards the end. That is not to say there aren’t good performances here, indeed there are some excellent ones: Katy Stephens’ tinnitus-plagued Kate makes her dilemma particularly human though I would forgive Oliver Dimsdale’s masculine arrogance in a heartbeat! Ferdy Roberts put up a good fight though as the gloomy Alexei, Christine Enwisle is superb as the waitress who switches between London and Moscow as she moves from one side of the stage to the other and pleasingly Jonjo O’Neill’s sound guy Peter is just excellent although under-used – his scenes with Mariah Gale’s neighbour being my favourite strand."
1280,1280,Ought To Be Clowns,30/11/2015,mag9l,The Distance, Orange Tree,"I hadn’t intended to revisit Deborah Bruce’s The Distance but a quick re-read of my review from its original production at the Orange Tree last year reminded me how much I enjoyed it (even beyond the thrill of seeing Helen Baxendale on stage for the first time). This new co-production between the Richmond venue and Sheffield Theatres sees director Charlotte Gwinner remount the show with a largely new cast but still a keen sense for the darkly comic edge of the writing. It remains as freshly sharp in its views on modern parenthood as ever, pointing up the hypocrisy of a society that blithely looks on by if a man leaves his family but is aghast should a mother do the same. And as a shell-shocked Bea returns alone from her adoptive Australia to the bosom of her best friends Kate and Alex , both parents themselves, back in Blighty, everyone’s preconceptions, personalities and peccadilloes are challenged."
1281,1281,Ought To Be Clowns,23/02/2016,mag9l,Cleansed, National,"I think I have to admit to liking the idea of Katie Mitchell more than the reality. In the build-up to each appearance her productions makes on these shores, long-form pieces emerge, delving into her practise, and some of the mystery behind why she has become so totemic a figure in European theatre yet still regarded with some suspicion by parts of the British establishment (qv this piece in the Guardian). And I think yeah, she is different but maybe this time I’ll get it, maybe this time instead of just being challenged as an audience member, I’ll feel connected to her work too. Safe to say though that Sarah Kane’s Cleansed was not the production for this breakthrough to occur. A notable event in marking Kane’s debut at the National Theatre and also a long-awaited return for Mitchell to the main programme on the South Bank after years of being frozen out by Hytner’s reluctance to let her loose on anything but children’s shows, it is naturally a hugely challenging event. Warnings abound of graphic scenes of physical and sexual violence, fainters have been reported at several performances (I reckon at least a couple of those must have been faking it just to get early release though), once again we ain’t in Kansas. Not that we ever would have expected to be. Cleansed was the third play of five that Kane completed and blisters uglily from the start with its inspiration that “being in love is like being in Auschwitz”, testing a set of human relationships under the barbaric conditions of institutionalised torture. Short scene after short scene plays out as a woman hunts for her murdered brother who has come back to life, as a gay couple have their love for each other tested in the extreme, as a sex worker is endlessly exploited, as shadowy figures execute crime after crime under the control of sadistic and enigmatic Tinker. It is unrelenting stuff – amputations, blindings, penetration, burnings, forced sex changes, drugs, rats, extended male and female nudity, all overseen by the gnomic figure of Tinker. And larger than that, Mitchell too looms, her tinkering with time slowing down key scenes of real menace and encouraging a real rawness from her company, especially in the surprisingly prescient forays into the fluidity of gender identity. But equally, the dream-like melding of one sequence into the next has an almost monotonous feel to it, the muted horror of so much stage violence experiencing considerably diminishing returns by the end."
1282,1282,Ought To Be Clowns,17/04/2015,mag9l,Plastic Figurines, New Diorama,"One day, Jamie Samuel will appear in a play that doesn’t make me cry, but today is not that day. Along with co-star Remmie Milner in Ella Carmen Greenhill’s play Plastic Figurines, he exerted as persistent and powerful a hold on my tear ducts as he did in the glorious Jumpers for Goalposts as this quietly devastating piece of new writing unfolds its fractured narrative with all the bruised authenticity and honesty of the most intimate diary. That feeling is appropriate too as though the play is fictional, it is inspired by elements of Greenhill’s own life as you can feel that in every jab and joke of the complicated sibling relationship here, and in the sensitive, nuanced depiction of autism on which the plot hinges. After their mother is diagnosed with terminal leukaemia, Rose has to leave university life in Edinburgh to return to the family home to look after teenage brother Mikey. But treading the fine line between being a sister and being a carer is a difficult one as Mikey’s strictly literal and logical view on the world colours their every interaction. From his lightly comic inability to grasp the concept of bluffing in Cluedo to the heart-breaking interpretation of the doctor’s utterance “she’s a fighter”, Samuel finds oceans of empathy in a young man who always has to work that bit harder, yet can still recognise the value in letting his big sister be right once in a while. Milner’s Rose is just as moving though, her shoulders weighed down by responsibility and her patience severely tested but never letting us forget the undying affection that underpins their bond, even in its most guilt-ridden moments. And as the scene structure flashes forward and back, aided immeasurably by the elegant washes of Richard Owen’s lighting, the depth of that connection but also the scale of their shared challenges comes into full view."
1283,1283,Ought To Be Clowns,25/08/2017,Ian,Loot, Park,"I ummed and aahed a bit about what to write about this one – I saw what I think was the final preview of Loot before a few days to retool before opening night on Wednesday and as with any comedy, especially farce, there’s nothing like doing it live to help it bed in. At the same time, I’m not much of a fan of farce (my fault I fear…) and only really booked for two reasons. 1 – it’s on the list. And 2 – Sinéad Matthews, future queen of all our hearts. She really is fantastic and it’s nice to see a shift in gear from her customary electrifying intensity."
1284,1284,Ought To Be Clowns,29/11/2019,Ian,A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, Trafalgar Studios,"Just a quickie as we’re nearly at the end of the run for A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, revived at the Trafalgar Studios by Simon Evans. This production might be sold on the star wattage of its leads Toby Stephens and Claire Skinner but for me, its real power comes in the casting of Storme Toolis as the titular Joe Egg, the first disabled actor to be cast in the role.  Its significant because the character of Joe is disabled herself, requiring constant supervision, the realities of which are starting to show on the marriage between Bri and Sheila. Evans embraces an arch vaudevillean style to let this fighting couple let us know what they’re thinking, to give us insight into the coping mechanisms necessary to give their daughter the best life she can have.  There’s perhaps a tendency to overplay the comedy, particularly by Stephens, at the expense of the heart-wrenching tragedy that dominates this family’s dynamic. Skinner manages the tragicomic balance better, as her hope overrides his despair, in the beautifully realised details of Peter McKintosh’s 1960s set and costumes."
1285,1285,Ought To Be Clowns,28/06/2011,Ian,The Village Bike, Royal Court,"Penelope Skinner makes her Royal Court debut upstairs with The Village Bike, having previously been a member of their Young Writers Programme and being the recipient of the 2011 George Devine Award for Most Promising Playwright (assumedly given before she co-authored Greenland…). It’s an unsettling portrait of a just-pregnant woman, Becky, recently moved to the country and struggling to come to terms with her new life and the restrictions placed on her both by her condition and her do-gooder husband who has taken to the role of father-to-be with great gusto but rather neglecting the role of husband, leading Becky to deal with her frustrations in ever-reckless ways. It is a very frank play, dealing with female sexuality in a way which is rarely seen (at least by me) onstage as Becky turns first to her husband’s furtive stash of p*rn films and then to a heady set of illicit liaisons with local bad boy Oliver Hardcastle, from whom she keeps her pregnancy secret, as she lives out her (and his) wildest sexual fantasies in the oppressive atmosphere of the heatwave that affecting just about everyone in the village. For no-one is particularly happy, especially the married people: fertility issues, dealing with continued absences due to work travel, difficulties of parenthood, sexual frustration, all these issues reverberate around the populace of the village, all underscored by the overbearing fear of loneliness that Skinner argues characterises rural living here. As is customary with the Royal Court, a stellar cast has been pulled together by director Joe Hill-Gibbins, led by Romola Garai as Becky who is nothing short of excellent as a seemingly demure English teacher driven by her emotions into pursuing a fantasy life to try and escape the crushing reality of what she has let herself in for. The looks of ambivalence on her face as she looks upon the baby paraphernalia that so excites those around her, the lack of comprehension of how significant her pregnancy is to other people is pointed up nicely by the satisfaction she feels from being viewed as a sexual object by the men of the village: this is a woman not quite ready to subsume her identity into that of motherhood just yet and Garai manages to portray this complexity with conviction. Dominic Rowan is excellently cast as Oliver, the man who facilitates Becky’s escape into fantasy, a supremely confident, swaggering tower of masculinity, utterly convinced of his irresistible charm and sexual prowess and equally unafraid to use his manipulative power to call things to a halt once he starts to get bored, hinting at the darker sides to his personality. Nicholas Burns as the eco-warrior champion husband, afraid to have sex with his wife for fear of hurting the baby and enemy of plastic bags, is strong though rendered a little toothless by Skinner, it might have been nice to show a little more depth to this character, a touch more of the charisma that must have whisked Becky away from her old life into marriage. And Phil Cornwell as the plumber employed to look at the noisily creaking pipes of the new house yet finding himself being used and abused in different ways brings a genuine charm. The lascivious comedy works well and the first half powers through nicely though I felt the second half doesn’t quite carry the same momentum through to the end, the introduction of a key new character late on is clumsily done despite Sasha Waddell’s best efforts and the wrapping up of proceedings into the too-neat ending felt something of an easy way out, leaving most of the issues raised within tantalisingly unresolved. That, I could live with in the end, the feeling of ambivalence throughout is surprisingly effective in that none of these characters are totally likeable, or otherwise; the final coda felt very misplaced to me though which was a shame as Skinner’s writing is largely to be commended for its depth and maturity. Hill-Gibbins’ production uses the space upstairs at the Royal Court very well, suggesting a range of different rural domestic settings often at the same time, directly contrasting Becky’s real life and fantasy life. And Helen Goddard’s design creates a great atmosphere of barn living, especially in the unfinished main set with boxes everywhere, leaking pipes, and loft insulation peeling from the ceiling. Throw in one of the supporting performances of the year from the ever-reliable Alexandra Gilbreath as the well-intentioned nosy neighbour, everything combines to great effect to make a really rather recommended evening. Saw the play Tuesday – the review is spot on."
1286,1286,Ought To Be Clowns,16/10/2010,Ian,T.E.O.R.E.M.A.T., Barbican,"T.E.O.R.E.M.A.T. sees the return of Polish theatre company TR Warszawa to the Barbican after their highly acclaimed 4.35 Psychosis earlier this year. I was meant to go and see that show, but after having had an awful day with some bad news thrown in for good measure a friend took my ticket instead for that emotionally bruising experience, but having seen this show, I kind of wish I had taken the risk: they are clearly a company firing at the top of their game. Based on a film by Pier Paolo Pasolini, Theorem, the show follows a rich businessman and his family as their lives are thrown into upheaval with the arrival of a mysterious stranger, who proceeds to seduce each and every one of them including the maid, who then departs just as suddenly, leaving everyone to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives and discover what has been revealed to them. It is performed in Polish with English surtitles, but is more akin to a silent movie with its series of near-wordless scenes played out in beautiful tableaux. I don’t imagine that this will be for everyone, but I enjoyed it and sitting here reflecting on it a day later, its hypnotic, haunting quality is still fresh in my mind. I haven’t seen the film, nor did I really know what it was about for seeing it, but for me it felt like an indictment of the materialism of the upper middle classes and their retreat from true emotional honesty. The visitation from Sebastian Pawlak’s Guest remains unexplained, from whence his interventions unknown, but the more significant part of the drama is the varying ways in which the members of the household react, or more accurately are able to react, in the face of this confrontation. Danuta Stenka’s mother was just stunning, one of the most unforgettable physical performances I have seen all year and almost all without words. The journey from composed socialite wife to an almost animalistic sexual being was traced with so much feeling and the final look of anguish on her face was harrowing to the extreme. And as the son Pietro, Jan Dravnel’s acknowledgment of his homosexuality and subsequent struggle to deal with the flood of emotion it unleashes was also beautifully played. His artistic fervour could so easily have been hammed up but it was perfectly judged. I also really enjoyed Rafał Maćkowiak’s performance as Angiolino, a most handsome and cheekily personable figure although his mysterious appearances shrouded in the dark during the opening scenes and his passing of judgement at the end of the show left me wondering just who this character really was: an intriguing dilemma."
1287,1287,Ought To Be Clowns,04/06/2013,Ian,Strange Interlude, National Theatre,"When a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s Strange Interlude was first announced as part of the National Theatre’s summer programme, the five hour running time of the original struck a note of fear in many a heart of those who are used to the cheap seats in the Lyttelton Theatre. And though it has been trimmed down to 3 hours 20 minutes in Simon Godwin’s production, it still proves something of a considerable challenge – not least because I could not see for the life of me why it has been revived. Due to its length and winning a Pulitzer Prize in 1928, it is no surprise that it ticks the ‘rarely performed classics’ box and featuring an absolute doozy of a central female role in Nina Leeds, it is no typical piece of theatre. Sadly, its main innovation – characters speaking their many, many internal thoughts out loud as asides – is one which felt far too similar to last week’s Passion Play to really impress. And it also makes what ought to be more seriously considered drama into an unexpected campfest that feels more like an American soap opera like Dynasty or Sunset Beach but with none of the schlocky enjoyment. Nina – the excellent Anne-Marie Duff – is a WASPy princess of a girl who reacts to the death of her fiancé in WWI and the stuffiness of her father by sleeping around a lot until the most important men in her life force her into making a decision. But though she settles for Jason Watkins’ solid businessman Sam Evans as her husband, she keeps the doctor who became her lover – Darren Pettie’s most handsome Darrell – and the family friend who has always admired her from afar – Charles Edwards’ daffy Charles (who would probably be more at home in a Tennessee Williams play…) – close at hand. Thus the long stretch of her life is characterised by the way in which she keeps these three men in thrall, orbiting her like moons around planet. Trouble is, there’s no discernible gravitational pull. Not even Duff’s considerable skills can really justify why Nina has such an irresistible effect, aside from a flintily indomitable spirit, and O’Neill doesn’t really give us much of a clue either. And though the men perform well – Edwards’ dry humour is particularly well served – the enduring benevolence that characterises these relationships rarely convinces, the play never really tugs at the heartstrings, and in its final scene, it severely tests the patience."
1288,1288,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2014,Ian,Richard III, Trafalgar Studios,"Clearly my opinions had already been shaped by friends and colleagues reassuring me it really wouldn’t be my cup of tea but the lure of a good cast is always strong and in some respects, this was true. Gina McKee’s defiant Queen Elizabeth, Jo Stone-Fewing’s oleaginous Buckingham, Maggie Steed’s mad Queen Margaret all emerge with credit but in the title role, Martin Freeman is much more of a debit, offering up a decent enough performance but one lacking any real gravitas."

1290,1290,Ought To Be Clowns,11/06/2013,Ian,The President Has Come To See You, Royal Court,"In a bold move as her opening salvo as incoming Artistic Director of the Royal Court, Vicky Featherstone has reimagined the way in which theatre is consumed in this venue with a range of innovative approaches suggested by a group of over 140 writers. The biggest of these is probably the Weekly Rep, a company of 14 actors and 4 directors performing 6 plays by new writers over 6 weeks, which started tonight with Georgian playwright Lasha Bugadze’s The President Has Come To See You, previously seen here as a rehearsed reading earlier in the year. Knowing my all-or-nothing tendencies, I had hoped that the ensemble would be full of actors I did not care for so that I’d be able to resist booking, but it was not to be with the likes of a re-bearded Ferdy Roberts, Ryan Sampson, Laura Elphinstone and Siobhan Redmond luring me to Sloane Square, even though the prospect of the play itself did not really appeal. And it was that inner voice nagging away that I ought to have paid more attention to, as the bizarre twists and turns of this post-Soviet surrealist adventure left me cold. When war threatens the land again, the president opts to cut his losses and run, disappearing into the relative obscurity of the general populace but finding his own serious quirks and foibles magnified by those of his people. A little background reading suggests this is a brave satire on former President Saakashvili, though this passed me by and I was left largely unmoved and unamused by the near-farcical goings-on. There’s some pleasure in seeing a talented cast in such a spirited atmosphere of fun – Vicky Featherstone directs with a loose, playful sensibility – but these moments were too few and far between for my liking. Watching Ryan Sampson bluffing with his muffin raises a chuckle and Paul Bhattacharjee’s president, always accompanied by Alan Williams’ faithful Dave the Driver, is well played. But elsewhere, the likes of Sam Troughton, Ferdy Roberts and Jonjo O’Neill are given far too little to work on to really impress – here’s hoping they have better opportunities later in the season – and Chloe Lamford’s functional set design, which has to work across all six shows, offers little of particular inspiration to make the staging really pop. "
1291,1291,Ought To Be Clowns,04/11/2011,Ian,Bang Bang Bang, Royal Court,"Though Stella Feehily’s Bang Bang Bang is set in the same part of the world as Lynn Nottage’s Ruined – the Democratic Republic of Congo – the focus of this play is less on the state of affairs in the civil war-torn country but rather delving behind the scenes of the charities, journalists and NGOs out there in Africa, looking at how it affects the lives of the humanitarian workers who go out there. Feehily did huge amounts of meticulous research for this play, interviewing a wide range of stakeholders from the international aid business. As often happens in such cases, there is the slight sense that Feehily has tried to cram in as much of what she has uncovered into the play as issue follows issue and the shocking scene that opens the show is explained through flashbacks and its aftermath subsequently probed. Experienced Sadhbh and newbie Mathilde set out on a harrowing mission to investigate tales of war crimes and end up in differing situations: Sadhbh, already testing the boundaries of her relationship by returning here as her boyfriend back in London shell-shocked from his own experiences as an aid worker wants her to give it up, accepts an invitation to tea with the warlord himself and finds an opposing account of events, and Mathilde finds herself a distraction in the form of photographer Vin, but both women are never far from danger and their choices have massive implications in their perilous circumstances. Performance-wise, there is little to fault: Orla Fitzgerald makes a convincing impact as the anguished Sadhbh as does Dan Fredenburgh as her bitterly resentful partner; Julie Dray’s Mathilde is highly appealing especially when finding relief with Jack Farthing’s Vin; and Frances Ashman and Babou Ceesay do incredible work at playing multiple characters, though there’s a niggling feeling that some of the Congolese characters should have been more developed. The play does suffer somewhat from being so focused on the personal travails of the aid workers no matter how serious they get, I couldn’t help but feel the sheer scale of what is happening in the Congo demands, or at least deserves, greater service than forming the backdrop to another story."
1292,1292,Ought To Be Clowns,15/05/2018,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Watermill,"In a week when Shakespearean-inclined eyes are trained on the opening of Michelle Terry’s tenure at the Globe with a season that promises to be “gender blind, race blind and disability blind”, it is gratifying to see other theatres in the UK already delivering this. And unsurprisingly, this kind of approach is full of rich potential to shake up your Shakespeare anew, making the Watermill’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream an unalloyed pleasure. Paul Hart’s production is full of innovative touches which work separately like a treat and also combine into something really special. It wears its actor musicianship lightly as music is used brilliantly to delineate the otherworldliness of the woods. If ‘I Put A Spell On You’ might seem overly literal for the dosing of love-in-idleness but lyrically it proves a remarkable fit the love/hate relationship of this Titania and Oberon, so too of Puck’s frustration at that latter father-figure.  Eva Feiler’s childlike interpretation of Puck is a powerful take – stripped of the typical swagger and constantly clutching a favourite doll, she brings a fascinatingly different complexion to this sprite. Victoria Blunt’s fiercely funny Bottom is an equally bracing breath of fresh air that reveals an effortless gift for comedy. And an inventive take on doubling sees Offue Okegbe take on Theseus and Snout, while Jamie Satterthwaite impresses as an impetuous Oberon and sniffy Starveling.  The quartet of lovers are very well done too. Lillie Flynn and Joey Hickman’s Helena and Demetrius are good but there’s a compelling emotion underscoring the connection between Sophie Stone’s Hermia and Tyrone Huntley’s Lysander. They sign to each other as often as speak and the BSL is integrated wonderfully, not least in the quick shift in the moment of pure shock as Hermia realises the shift in her beloved’s affection.  "
1293,1293,Ought To Be Clowns,13/07/2016,mag9l,Mumburger, The Archivist’s Gallery,"The clues may be there but I was still astounded by Sarah Kosar’s Mumburger, an arresting new drama that has set up residence in The Archivist’s Gallery, a venue tucked away by the canal in Haggerston. Described as a play about “family, grief and red meat”, this world premiere of a hyper-local piece of writing (Broadway Market, Rich Mix and Columbia Road flower market all get a mention) from The Archivist’s inaugural writer-in-residence certainly makes for an interesting beginning for Kosar’s tenure here. After a tragic car crash, an Anglo-American family is shattered by grief and their differing responses to their loss. Father Hugh retreats into himself, at a loss for what to say or do; daughter Tiffany is conversely a torrent of words and action, a whirlwind of activity as a distraction technique. But 72 hours after the loss of the wife and mother they miss so dearly, an unexpected act of “environmental performance art” throws up a bizarre but searching challenge. At once humorous and horrific, this spin is a genuine assault on the senses but what’s interesting about Kosar’s writing is the adventurousness of its spirit. Jagged shards of dreamlike conversation sit alongside evocative projections (strong work from Arnim Friess), conventional storytelling bleeds into spoken word poetry, the dizzying disorientating nature of earth-shattering grief thus conjured in a highly theatrical but still meaningful manner, the desperation with which we cling to ways to remain close to those who’ve passed a compelling dramatic hook. And it is matched by a production from Tommo Fowler that is equally daring: Rūta Irbīte’s design pairs flowing fabric with foodie functionality; Purvi Trivedi’s textured sound design disquiets and disarms as Hugh and Tiffany try to process the situation with which they’re faced. Lindon Alexander is quietly powerful as a parent who is realising too late what kind of parent he should have been, almost childish in his competing to have the best stories to share, finding succour if not satisfaction in pot-smoking and the revelation and discovery of secrets about both his wife and daughter. "
1294,1294,Ought To Be Clowns,05/05/2016,mag9l,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Shakespeare’s Globe,"Above the stage for Emma Rice’s inaugural production as artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe is an illuminated sign that reads “rock the ground”. A quote from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which is the opening show of this season, it also feels like something of a statement of intent, a determination to do things her own which on this evidence, feels guaranteed to ruffle the feathers of a traditionalist or three.  So lights are being used like never before, sound systems only previously heard at gigs dusted off, and a resolutely idiosyncratic approach to the text employed. At times, it feels like a raucous rough-housing which makes for a different Bankside experience at the very least, and one which I have to say got round to seducing me. I’m sure Rice will have her detractors, as she moves from Kneehigh to the Globe,  but the scope of her ambition here is rather awesome in its boldness. There are also innovations that fluctuate in their efficacy. Rice has made no secret of her desire to make Shakespeare easier to understand and this she does by ruthlessly editing. There’s “ugly bitches” in amongst the “canker-blossoms” and “puppets”, the Rude Mechanicals’ play isn’t “preferred”, it’s “in the final two” and as they’re reimagined as Globe staff, so their occupations are updated…enter Nick Bottom the health and safety officer. So it’s not just about making it easier to understand, it’s about making it easier to laugh, inserting a vein of comedy rather than mining it from the text itself. And something of its poetry is lost too in these unexpected deviations and in the lack of texture to the amplification, Katy Owen’s Puck suffering most here in a shouty manner that undermines some of her more interesting choices in presenting such an emotional sprite. It will be thus be interesting to see how the other directors in this opening season (Caroline Byrne, Iqbal Khan, Matthew Dunster) are encouraged to approach the verse. The considerable use of music, composed by Stu Barker, also has its issues: a preponderance of songs slow the pace somewhat (their length presumably dictated by the amount of time needed for the actors playing the Mechanicals to change costumes into the fairies), and the decision to underscore several scenes with musical accompaniment teeters on the edge of overwhelming. I did like the Bollywood influences that shone through though and you have to think that Shakespeare would definitely have approved of a fellow artist such as David Bowie getting a tribute here. For all the issues that might be perceived, the over-riding sense is of an artistic director giving a tree an almighty, mischievous, good shake and seeing how it all falls out. Only a fool would try to characterise Rice’s forthcoming reign off the back of one production (Spacey and Cloaca, anyone?); rather its the decisions to institute a 50/50 gender split right off the bat and to programme such diversity in this opening Wonder Season (including a new music series called Wonder Women) that point to an immediate future full of variety – we’ll see how much of this change sticks but the worst thing a cultural institution can do is stagnate.   "
1295,1295,Ought To Be Clowns,26/04/2016,mag9l,The Toxic Avenger, Southwark Playhouse,"Baby, can’t you see, I’m calling. A show like this, should wear a warning…that warning should be avoid the front row if you’re squeamish about having your face touched by strangers! For The Toxic Avenger is nothing if not hands on, drawing its Southwark Playhouse audience right into its B-movie world, the poison paradise of the New Jersey town of Tromaville. And as we come to see, whether just a taste on the lips or a full-body dunking, the effects of toxic waste Based on the 1984 film of the same name, a cult classic of which I hadn’t heard, its hero is Melvin Ferd the Third, a geeky scientist determined to clean up the town but who soon finds himself the victim of such a dunking. Transformed and deformed, he emerges as Toxie, the Toxic Avenger – all rippling abs and dangling eyeballs – and newly fortified to tackle the dastardly Mayor whose scheming has caused the pollution and also take the plunge with hot blind librarian Sarah who rejected him as a nerd. But don’t let anything as prosaic as an age-old plot get in the way of how silly and schlocky the fun here is. Benji Sperring’s direction is witty and warm, ridiculous and yet still reverential to the musical form to which it constantly pays homage. Both the staging and the writing (Joe DiPietro’s book, David Bryan’s music and shared lyrics) feel rooted in a long tradition of cultish entertainment and it’s hard not to get swept up in the exuberance of it all, especially given the brightness of Alex Beetschen’s musical direction. If it falls down a tiny bit, it’s in not quite having enough heart to its central romance. Little Shop of Horrors works so well because you’re so invested in Seymour and Audrey and whilst the emotional transformation of Mark Anderson’s Toxie is wryly done, Hannah Grover’s brashly funny Sarah ends up a little one-note, you crave more character to go with the comedy and perhaps a little less reliance on the gags about being blind. They’re still an engaging couple but the attention is pulled elsewhere. Namely to the other three company members who steal pretty much every scene they enter. Lizzii Hills gets the show’s standout moment in ‘Bitch/Slut/Liar/Whore’ when her Mayor duets with Melvin’s mother, who is also played by her, it’s thrillingly well done as is the number that precedes it ‘Evil is Hot’. And Ashley Samuels and Marc Pickering as the two ‘dudes’ who cover the dozens of townsfolk in the story are just genius, waiting to see who they would emerge as next was always an absolute delight and without fail, hilarious."
1296,1296,Ought To Be Clowns,17/06/2011,Ian,Takeaway, Theatre Royal Stratford East,"Eddie Woo is stuck working in his dad’s takeaway, having failed his A-Levels yet again, but frequently escapes to his daydreaming world where he is the New (Chinese) Tom Jones. Back in the real world though, he is juggling two girlfriends, a best friend who might be drifting away from him and a full-time job though when a talent show seems to offer a potential way out, it leads to yet more confusion as Eddie is finally forced to decide what it is he really wants from life. Such is the set up for the Theatre Royal Stratford East’s new show Takeaway, music by Leon Ko and book and lyrics by Robert Lee, which makes the claim to be the first ever British-Chinese musical. There is just so much going on in here that the overwhelming impression is that I suspect Lee and Ko might actually be certifiably insane. The manic way in which the show rockets around its different subject areas and formats is breathtaking and not always in a good way. Talent shows, racism, the pressure of working in family businesses, the Chinese immigrant experience and generation gap, frustrated youth dealing with the lack of opportunities, the questioning of sexuality and much more beside are all thrown into the melting pot alongside a structure which throws in songs in the most arbitrary of manners: as Eddie’s internal monologues, insane fantasy sequences, romantic ballads, storytelling songs, comedy numbers, Tom Jones pastiches. Everything is whirled together and so we ricochet from plot strand to plot strand with dizzying speed, resulting in a show that, however well-intentioned, ends up as something of a mess. The show works best in playing to its strengths which are the women of the cast. Gloria Onitiri and Gabby Wong are both delightfully batty and full-voiced as Eddie’s bits on the side: Onitiri’s bunny-boiler antics and Wong’s ‘Yellow Power’ activism raising chuckles. Natasha Jayetileke’s Dillon, Eddie’s best friend, is also strong and there’s excellent comedy value from Shelley Williams who rocks up in a number of small roles, grabbing huge laughs every time – her Welsh accent is really something to behold. Stephen Hoo’s Eddie is perhaps a little too reserved, not really exploding with charisma when given the chance too, and not exploiting the opportunities to progress his performance along this journey. Marcus Ellard’s Reese gets to share the loveliest song of the night with Hoo’s Eddie in ‘Come With’ (and not just because they’re singing in their boxer shorts!) which is nicely reprised with Dillon later on, but there is little real exploration of these relationships that really matter to Eddie as the revelation of the interval plays out. And this is the recurring theme, there is just so much stuffed into the show, that little is really given the opportunity to be satisfactorily resolved whether its the talent show, the father/son relationship, the presence of the character of Widow Chu, Eddie’s education, the matter of who truly wins Eddie’s heart and why: indeed the most fantastical element of the show would be how he manages to attract so many lovers. The ambition on display here at the Theatre Royal Stratford East is truly admirable, especially in giving a platform to a much-neglected voice in British theatre in that of the Anglo-Chinese. But perhaps because of the weight of expectation and the vastness of unexplored scope available, the focus has been left far too wide in trying to deal with too much in the space of the one show. Odd choices abound: for a show that claims to be about being young, British and hopelessly confused, there’s a large amount of humour that had the Chinese in the audience helpless with laughter yet sailed right over my head – injokes are fine but when used sparingly; musically there’s not enough excitement or memorable tunes; the pacing is so uneven as we move, for example, straight from fantasy number to a heartfelt father/son moment; the choice to have a finale of a song we haven’t heard before and the generally schizophrenic nature of the show and its uncertain relationship with reality makes it hard to really connect. For all that, it was actually intermittently rather fun and undoubtedly something unique, which sets it aside from many a new show which retreads old ground or repackages jukebox tunes. So go along with the thought that it is a work in progress and you might just be pleasantly surprised."

1298,1298,Ought To Be Clowns,10/09/2011,Ian,No Naughty Bits, Hampstead,"No Naughty Bits continues the slightly odd trend at the Hampstead Theatre for new plays that are fictionalised versions of real events. Set in December 1975 after Monty Python’s Flying Circus had been broadcast on US television by ABC but in an edited and censored version that cut out the ‘naughty bits’. It follows the legal struggles of Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam as they fly out to New York to battle the network and defend their show, arguing in court for the freedom of artistic expression, against censorship and demonstrating how far apart senses of humour can be. Steve Thompson’s play is fictional, described as a ‘fantasy version’ of what happened though quite what that means, I am not entirely sure. Harry Hadden-Paton is the one carrying the weight of the show on his shoulders here as Michael, the driving force behind the defence of their beloved television show even if, or maybe because of, the fact that it is not their best work, John Cleese having left the group and so something of the unique magical mixture gone forever. Hadden-Paton shows us the man before the fame really kicked in, still in disbelief that he’d come as far as he had but not yet successful enough to be able to afford the Christmas presents he wants to get his kids, and he does sterling work throughout, his rather plaintive naïveté in dealing with this new commercial world is most appealing. The main problem though is that too often the writing just isn’t funny enough, especially in the first half. Neither Palin nor Gilliam, an opaque turn from Sam Alexander, are really allowed to be funny themselves outside of the Python gags, amusing as they are especially when trying to explain them to the Americans. And the other characters, whether real or imagined: Clive Rowe’s media lawyer, Charity Wakefield’s hippyish management/press agent, Issy van Randwyck’s miscast television executive serve more as devices than anything else. It is only with the arrival of Matthew Marsh’s rather liberal Judge Lasker does the play gain its one truly funny character and consequently his perfectly comic performance really does lift the second act. Ed Hall’s directorial choices feel rather odd for the most part: the overarching conceit with its hints of Pythonesque silliness are only really utilised at the start and finish where it could have more usefully and amusingly been employed throughout; the courtroom scene is nearly ruined with a ton of needless hustle and bustle; and though we’re still in preview, there’s a hell of lot of work needed on the stage management side of things to ensure that clunky set changes are smoothed out and crucial cues are hit at exactly the right moment. Ultimately, No Naughty Bits left me disappointed. The wigs and 70s costumes are fun and there are some amusing moments in there but the play just didn’t prove itself witty enough for me, nowhere near the ‘gloriously funny’ claimed on the promotional material. Nor does it really delve satisfyingly into the dramatic possibilities, mostly sidestepping the larger issues around the crumbling relationships of the Monty Python group, part of the problem in operating in this kind of fictionalised reality. Thompson can’t resist a final scene though that plugs everything back into the real world, akin to the end of a movie where it is explained what each character got up to in the future, fantasy turning into reality and thus leaving us questioning exactly what it is we have just seen."
1299,1299,Ought To Be Clowns,07/09/2014,Ian,The Return of the Soldier, Jermyn Street Theatre,"There’s something simply exquisite about The Return of the Soldier, an intimate chamber musical tucked away into the Jermyn Street Theatre that might just be one of the best things I’ve seen this year. Granted, it may contain a checklist of some of my favourite things – the experience of women in wartime, a score for piano and cello, Laura Pitt-Pulford – but they combine into something above and beyond, a powerful meditation on the psychological effects of war on those not at the front, a valuable reminder in a year that commemorates the start of the First World War that the impact of war ripples through all levels of society.   "
1300,1300,Ought To Be Clowns,27/07/2011,Ian,Nightwatchman, National Theatre,"But in flitting around such huge topics without really engaging with them beyond the superficial, there’s a sense of frustration that builds. A fair amount of knowledge is presumed of the audience member, my hazy recall of the recent geopolitics in the region didn’t help enough, and the jargon-filled cricket references mainly sailed on by. Worst of all though, is that is makes Abirami a largely unsympathetic protagonist. Every time the surface is scratched and the promise of something interesting to further develop is revealed, Puwanarajah ducks away and the attention diverted elsewhere. Stephanie Street battles gamely to bring life beyond the labels, to flesh out this character beyond being a simple vessel to spout words but she is fighting a losing battle against the material. It is a fine performance though."

Their tenure there has now come to an end though and so they’re branching out to alternative venues and times of the year, popping up now at the Southwark Playhouse with a new version of Gorky’s rarely-performed Vassa Zheleznova. Adapted by Emily Juniper who has transported the play to a Liverpool in the midst of the dockers’ strike of the mid-90s, Sian Polhill-Thomas’ Vassa is the tough-as-nails head of a shipping company whose grip on power is slowly being loosened. The business belonged to her husband’s family but he’s long been busy failing to be a rock star, so it has been her guts and determination that has built the firm’s success, but at some considerable personal cost and as crisis looms, things don’t look to be getting any easier. As her husband dies an ignominious death under the shadow of public shame, her daughters turn against her and professionally, she’s got the press to think about as well as her striking workforce. Director Rachel Valentine-Smith keeps the action in Vassa’s office but the mutable design choice of platforms keeps the perspective shifting, as estranged family members and disgruntled employees repeatedly rattle the certainties of her world, pushing her to ever-more extreme action in the name of protecting her business, her family, herself. The production never quite lands on a satisfactory delivery model though. An early sequence of the striking movement that is typical of this company is not repeated, losing something of what makes The Faction stand out. And though the play impressively puts its female characters at the forefront of the action, it does little to make us connect with them – characters don’t need to be likeable to be engaging but I found something to unremitting about this tortured family grouping."
1303,1303,Ought To Be Clowns,08/12/2015,mag9l,You For Me For You, Royal Court,"One can imagine co-stars Kwong Loke and Andrew Leung at a Christmas party or somesuch, making conversation with someone else who asks them who they are playing in the Royal Court show they’re both in. Loke would say ‘Doctor/Well/Rice Musician/Farm Hand/Disembodied Voice/Delivery Person/Neighbour/Teacher’ and Leung would say well I’m only a ‘Smuggler/Frog/Man In Bear Suit/Soldier/Clerk/Youngsup’ and the other person would nod politely and then say ‘but have you seen Hangmen‘. This gives you something of a sense of the mystical scope of Mia Chung’s You For Me For You and the journeys that her protagonists, two North Korean sisters, take in her delicious confection of a play. Minhee and Junhee want nothing more than for the other to be strong and healthy but under the unblinking eye of Great Leader Kim Jong-Il, food and medicine and hope are scarce and so they decide to flee. But as they make the arduous journey to the border and are asked to make a huge sacrifice, the sisters are torn apart. Jon Bausor’s sci-fi-leaning set design comes into its own here, its mirrored portal and suggesting that the border trying to be crossed is more than just one between two countries but between entire cultural mindsets, orthodoxies, even realities. Wendy Kweh’s deeply empathetic Minhee remains trapped in her homeland – courtesy of a properly brilliant design coup, Tal Rosner’s video working brilliantly here – ensnared in a surreally corrupt system that even Kafka would dismiss as far-fetched, Kweh painfully expressing not just a literal hunger but a spiritual one. Katie Leung’s Junhee meanwhile finds herself in New York where she sets about earning enough money to return and get her sister over the border too. These scenes are hilariously mounted due to some amazing work by Daisy Haggard as a range of characters Junhee meets as she tries to assimilate, the gobbledygook they’re speaking slowly becoming more recognisable as English presumably at the rate Junhee is learning the language.  And even as a relationship with Paapa Essiedu’s Alabama-born Wade develops into something utterly charming (the scene where they discuss their future dreams is gorgeously directed by Richard Twyman and movement director Eddie Kay), Chung reminds us the American Dream is just that, a dream, on the other end of the idealism spectrum from the “Best Nation in the World” but not totally divorced from it as much as they may beg to differ."
1304,1304,Ought To Be Clowns,09/12/2012,Ian,Privates on Parade, Noël Coward Theatre,"Well what an unexpected thing Privates on Parade turned out to be. Not knowing anything about it in advance meant it was full of surprises: the ‘play with songs’ moniker shouldn’t disguise the fact that it is closer to a musical than a play, and it very much needs to be treated as the period piece that it is. On the face of it, its ribald campery and racial stereotyping could be something of an affront, a relic of an old-fashioned past with old-fashioned attitudes, but to merely dismiss it as dated and offensive is to miss the wider points of Peter Nichols’ 1977 play and the nuances of Michael Grandage’s production, first seen at the Donmar in 2001.(FYI: this was a preview performance.) The play opens the Michael Grandage residency at the Noël Coward theatre, a season of five star-studded plays – Simon Russell Beale is the marquee name here – with a new pricing model aiming for greater affordability for drama in the West End. It’s set in the fictional Song and Dance Unit South East Asia (SADUESA), a British army entertainment corps stationed there at the time of the Malayan Emergency in the aftermath of the Second World War, and follows this troupe of military entertainers as they tour their act through the hostile jungle of the Malayan peninsula. So against the near-oblivious flamboyance of the Marlene Dietrich covers, cabaret turns and jaunty full ensemble numbers, is a backdrop of long-simmering native discontent and explosive violence for which they are ill-prepared. So once one has become attuned to the tone of the production and established that there’s a hugely warm humanity at work which means we’re laughing with and not at what is being said on stage. It helps that it is anchored by a sensational performance by Russell Beale as Acting Captain Terri Dennis, the director and drag queen lead of the show and a homosexual thoroughly of the old school. Feminising everyone’s names, tripping off single and double entendres with every blink of his mascaraed lashes, he is clearly having a ball and his enthusiasm is infectious, especially as he never lets us forget the man beneath the makeup, there’s love and tenderness in there alongside a sly defiance against society’s entrenched homophobia. Likewise with the fresh young privates, the raucous comedy and buck-naked antics (there is a good airing of the privates’ privates) are highly enjoyable, but given considerable extra heft by the context in which they are happening – we see as much of their life off the stage as on it, the shifting dynamics of power and sex, of love and control. So John Marquez’s ever-swearing Brummie Len constructs a beautifully tender relationship with Harry Hepple’s Charles that flies entirely in the face of the reality waiting for him at home; the naïve new arrival Steven Flowers gains life experience of all kinds, especially at the hands of mixed-race Sylvia – a lithe Sophiya Haque – Joseph Timms depicting this blooming of Flowers with a wide-eyed joy; and Angus Wright’s Major Flack is just superb, a bastion of true awkward old-school officer-class Englishness (witness him explaining the facts of life to Flowers, in French) which deftly suggests the decline of Empire. Denis King’s music revels in its playfulness, though I’m personally not a fan of the way the use of songs switches throughout the show – the performance numbers that the troupe deliver, such as Dietrich and Carmen Miranda take-offs, are mixed with narrative songs in true musical theatre fashion which confuses the tone a little, though Nichols’ lyrics are always cleverly executed to say much more than they initially appear to. Christopher Oram’s simple design looks excellent under Paule Constable’s astute lighting and contains a number of effective flourishes (loved the rainbow effect), not least a stirring final image that challenges and provokes as much as anything that has gone before."
1305,1305,Ought To Be Clowns,07/03/2010,Ian,A Day at the Racists, Finborough,"It’s been a bit of a political weekend for me, what with Moonfleece and A Day at the Racists, a new play by Anders Lustgarten premiering at the Finborough, both looking at the encroachment of the British National Party in East London and how this rise in fascist politics could have happened. But where as Moonfleece let the politics form a backdrop to a different story, A Day at the Racists is not afraid to show its teeth and really examine what motivates people to considering the BNP as a serious political option. Set in Dagenham, dyed-in-the-wool Old Labour stalwart Peter is struggling to deal with the disillusionment of his daily life. This is highlighted by his son Mark’s inability to get regular work and to secure a council flat for him and his daughter, whilst Pete perceives that the immigrants in the area are having their needs met first. When a local BNP campaigner’s message, a smartly dressed British Asian woman at that, resonates strongly with him, he falls for the rebranding and the renewed sense of purpose given to him as she employs Pete as her campaign manager. Sucked into this murky world, Pete is forced to face the conflict between his new politics and old, between new relationships and his multicultural old friends and family, all the while dealing with his ultimate sense of betrayal by a country he has worked so hard for. And it is powerful, urgent, contemporary stuff. Lustgarten’s real achievement has been in creating a highly authentic world: each character rings true, both in their inter-relationships and in their passionately held beliefs no matter what end of the political spectrum. And the situations into which he places them are instantly recognisable: any London commuter will nod at the opening scene set on a raucous bus filled with speakers of every language but English, the palpable alienation felt by Pete being leavened with the wittily subversive reality of what is actually being said, provided by an onstage translator. In the cosy space of the Finborough, events can sometimes feel a little cramped, especially when there are multiple characters onstage, but the intimacy serves to heighten the tension and helps the audience to really feel the strong emotions of the piece. I was a great fan of Sam Swainsbury in The Rivals earlier this year, and not just because he practically sat on my knee, but he is even better here as single dad Mark and I defy you not to fall in love with him here, even if just a little bit! He is cheeky and charming, the date in Nando’s is possibly the funniest scene I have seen so far this year, but he also plays the emotional scenes of the second half with conviction. Thusitha Jayasundera is terrifyingly plausible as Gina the manipulative mixed-race BNP candidate, with a brave intense performance that remains credible throughout, and really does leave one questioning how far we as a society have allowed the BNP into the mainstream political and media arena."
1306,1306,Ought To Be Clowns,22/04/2010,Ian,Women Beware Women, National Theatre,"The plot goes a little something like this: Bianca, the daughter of a wealthy Venetian family, elopes to Florence with a poor merchant’s clerk Leantio. While he’s away on business the Duke of Florence sees Bianca and is determined to seduce her. Bianca leaves her husband when the Duke offers her a life of luxury. In a separate plot line, Isabella is faced with going into a loveless marriage with a rich yet stupid ward. She’s appalled when her uncle Hippolito confesses his love for her. But her aunt Livia, Hippolito’s sister, cunningly persuades Isabella that she isn’t related by blood, so she’s tricked into an incestuous relationship with her uncle. That’s clear, right? This was the second preview so they are still clearly ironing out some issues: it was a full half hour shorter than the first outing, but still a lengthy three hours and the first half in particular had a very slow pace with little use of the vast space of the Olivier. It must be said though that this is as much a fault of the play as anything, too many scenes in which too little happens. Things only really kicked into life just before the interval for me, but once it did, the play flew furiously by as the machinations of all involved got more and more twisted resulting in a finale of epic proportions which currently has less of the ‘wow!’ factor and more of a ‘huh?’ factor. In a ten minute mostly wordless scene, each of the plot strands reaches its climactic end as the set endlessly revolves, resulting in a complete visual overload of information, currently with insufficient narrative clarity to drive home the true scale of what we have just witnessed. It also recalls the opening scene of the recent production of The Revenger’s Tragedy which I can’t decide if it is a nice homage or just plain unoriginal. Middleton’s strengths seem to lie in witty dialogue and being unafraid to go to delve in darker places than one might expect. That said, acting-wise, I found it solid rather than outstanding. Harriet Walter is strong as the manipulative Livia, but the honours probably go to Samuel Barnett who brings a real hurt and vulnerability to the cuckolded Leantio and Harry Melling has an absolute ball as The Ward, revelling in his insouciant foolishness and coming preciously close to stealing almost every scene he is in. Lauren O’Neill is also good as Bianca whose journey once sucked into the machinations of the Florentine court brings out a much darker side to her character. This production is not lacking resources by any means and Marianne Elliot has brought together some delightful elements along with Lez Brotherston’s design. The live music and singer provide great sonic accompaniment, the costumes are beautifully opulent, Harriet Walter’s red dress in particular is gorgeous, there’s an amazingly sumptuous banquet which opens the second half, but the highlight for me was one of those design touches that only the National can manage. As the Duke wanders past Bianca’s balcony, he appears at the back of the stage and crosses over with a spotlight following him as glitter cascades from above all the while, it is a stunning image and highly effective. There is naturally a couple of occasions when the already rich pudding is over-egged though, most notably with the winged attendants in the final scene who sent the cry of ‘fly, my pretties’ dangerously close to my lips. The more I think about this production the less I think I enjoyed it: with such a slow beginning and such a convoluted ending, I’m not sure how much I engaged with it at all. However, it is well-acted and the scale of the show is suitably grand for the Olivier and indeed, I left the theatre in quite a good mood so maybe it is one to just enjoy in the moment and then don’t bother contemplating it again! Far too long, far too big for the Olivier, far too dull: just disappointing. Saw this last night. Again a preivew. Very slow first half, picks up in the second half. Then loses it in a very dull, loud, WTF ending. Worth it for Samuel Barnett, Followspot and glitter sequence, and £10 tickets. Altough wouldn't pay over that for it. Yes, it is definitely a ten pound show…! Good review. Only just saw this and agree that it's a very mixed bag. I hated the music, which  I felt only served to drain tension out of the scenes. But some great performances and effective sequences, especially the wonderful chess scene. "
1307,1307,Ought To Be Clowns,19/07/2015,mag9l,She Stoops To Conquer, Theatre Royal Bath,"Restoration comedies fit the Theatre Royal Bath with the snugness of centuries-old comfort but even with Lindsay Posner updating She Stoops To Conquer to the 1920s, it’s hard not to feel that there’s something inherently dusty about this austere venue. Audiences in London have been spoiled for choice with witty reinventions of the genre – Jessica Swale’s brilliant revisionist work on shows like The Rivals and The Busy Body have enlivened the Southwark Playhouse and the National has had raucous takes on The Beaux’ Stratagem (still running) and this very Oliver Goldsmith play effervescently directed by Jamie Lloyd. But Posner ‘s direction has a near-fatal lugubriousness in the first half which, already weighed down with a considerable amount of scene-setting and expositionary dialogue, makes for very hard going. Sad to say, things are just dull for too long and nowhere near light-heartedly entertaining enough to do justice to this cracking comedy. The tropes of mismatched love affairs, disguised paramours, mistaken identities and wonderfully ambitious women are all present and correct – London gents Marlow and Hastings mistaking the Hardcastles’ country pile for a country inn and have to go a country mile around the houses to undo the damage they inflict and ensure love wins the day. Hubert Burton and Jack Holden work a Jeeves and Wooster vibe as the hapless pair but never really exploit it to its fullest and in the case of the former, crucially lack the real charm a romantic lead needs to get us truly invested, Catherine Steadman’s Kate – the daughter of the house – is stronger, especially when working her way into Marlow’s affections by affecting the role of a serving girl (because he’s too shy to talk to a proper lady, natch) though she is clearly better than him. But Harry Michell’s Tony Lumpkin (a stage debutant), the mischievous manipulator of events has an uncontrolled energy that he’ll need to learn to better manage. "
1308,1308,Ought To Be Clowns,12/02/2015,Ian,Gods and Monsters, Southwark Playhouse,"There’s a variety of warnings to heed before going into see Russell Labey’s Gods and Monsters at the Southwark Playhouse – a first half that is 85 minutes long, there’s strobe lighting and there’s male nudity. And with the last point in mind, forgive a puerile game of wordplay throughout the length of this review – ding dong, we’ve started. The story focuses on the final days of James Whale, director of films like Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein (but not Frankenweenie) as he variously battles illness and the distracting presence of his hunky new gardener –will he survive, make a cock-up of the situation or perhaps even both? Sequestered in the Hollywood Hills, Whale lives with his long-suffering maid Maria where he entertains a steady flow of adoring Tom, Dick and Harrys (or should that be John Thomas and Johnsons) – often young, often gay – in search of gossipy interviews about old Hollywood. But the misbehaving organ that is his disintegrating mind is letting those memories – shown here in elegant flashbacks – peter away and Whale is determined that he will get the last word. It is a quietly paced play in which the whole package doesn’t always quite fit together perfectly but there can be no doubting the absolutely tremendous performance from Ian Gelder as Whale – rarely off-stage and undeniably on the top of his game. It’s a tricky line to tread between repressed artistic soul and dirty old man pulling his todger but Gelder nails it, recalling a manhood of yesteryear – shaped by wartime experience, homosexuality’s illegality, a different code from a different time – and breathing a lyrical lived-in grace to the script as he banters with his houseguests or recalls love affairs of his past. He’s shaken from this rhythm by the raw masculinity of Will Austin’s ram-rod straight Boone, first seen hosed with sweat from using his tool in the garden (reports it was a chopper remains unconfirmed) and relentlessly subjected to Whale’s lascivious gaze and ultimately his devious plotting. As such, it’s not the strongest role for Austin to wield his sword against, lumbered with awkward lines about the discomfort of being the subject of the male gaze whilst having essentially been employed for the very same reason. Joey Phillips fares better as a flirtatious fan and a younger Whale and Lachele Carl is drily effective as Maria. Given how much time is spent whipping clothes off, there’s something mildly ironic about there being a named costume designer in Jason Denvir and that sparseness also extends to his set design with empty frames standing in for doors with nary a knob or a knocker to be seen, in turn allowing shafts of Mike Robertson’s lighting to illuminate the action beautifully, whether watching the leg of a trouser snake onto the floor during a lewder moment or a plate of uneaten sausage sandwiches (or were they cucumber?)"
1309,1309,Ought To Be Clowns,15/10/2010,Ian,Songs from a Hotel Bedroom, Watford Palace Theatre,"Songs from a Hotel Bedroom is a new dance/musical hybrid written by Kate Flatt and Peter Rowe which uses the music of Kurt Weill and tango dancing to illuminate the journey of a tragic love affair. Produced by SEGUE, a company known for their cross-artform work and co-produced with Watford Palace Theatre, The New Wolsey Theatre in Ipswich and co-comissioners ROH2 at the Royal Opera House, it will perform short runs at each venue over the coming weeks. Starting in a hotel room in New York in 1949, we meet Angélique, a singer who is picking her way through a suitcase of memories as she looks back on a rollercoaster journey of a short but heady romance with songwriter Dan, interspersed with traditional musical numbers, performances by Angélique in character and two dancers who appear periodically, adding their own commentary on the relationship. It is quite a mix of elements and occasionally they all come together perfectly, but at times things are a bit disjointed, particularly in the way that the dancers are used. Too often they come on after a musical number has finished but to the sound of something musically different, thereby meaning that the evening doesn’t flow as well as it should. But there are also times when everything comes together gloriously, like during a raucous aftershow party in a hotel with Angélique singing ‘One Life To Live’ with the band partying and playing with her and the dancers in there too. Frances Ruffelle is superb as chanteuse Angélique, perhaps predictably strongest in the straight performances of numbers like September Song and a beautiful rendition of Maurice Magre’s ‘Je Ne T’aime Pas’. And when she sings with Nigel Richards’ powerfully voiced Dan, there’s a great chemistry. They struggle a little more in the dramatic scenes due to some rather trite dialogue which veers close to melodrama throughout, but these are mostly short and the music is never far away. Amir Giles and Tara Pilbrow dance beautifully with predominantly tango-inspired routines, but there’s a few contemporary sequences in there too which test the athletism of both of them. The musical arrangements are by James Holmes who also leads the seven person band who play throughout on-stage with a nice precision and great balance; they additionally play the role of Dan and Angélique’s accompanists and so have some interaction with proceedings as well. Chloe Lamford’s set design is effective: two archways with sliding panels able to suggest a range of locations, often with a nice reveal but it did have the result of forcing the band to the very back of the stage which means only the people in the most central seats can see them all, half the players were hidden from my view and I had reasonably good seats. Her costumes were excellent though, especially for Ruffelle who got a series of lovely ensembles, sexy period underwear as well as a gorgeous burgundy dress for her big show. Songs from a Hotel Bedroom is a nicely ambitious piece of musical theatre which is refreshingly different and unafraid to experiment. Not all of it comes off 100%, but the use of Kurt Weill’s music is inspired as it is so evocative and perfectly bittersweet for this story and sung as well as it is here by Ruffelle and Richards, it makes for an entertaining evening. Saw the original script in hand workshop production (Frances Ruffelle then with Julian Ovenden)at the New Wolsey last year so will be interesting to see the developed version next week. The incorporation of the dance was lacking in the workshop and identified in the post show feedback as an area for development so interesting to hear that it still not spot on.  Will also be interesting to see how the story has developed as in the workshop it was a struggle to follow the plot and not entirely clear what the driver was apart from a framework for the songs. It was an odd one: I would have much preferred to see each dance routine flow straight from a song without the music stopping, or conversely starting off with the dance and then moving into the song so that there was a real feeling of integration."
1310,1310,Ought To Be Clowns,18/12/2013,Ian,Richard II, Barbican,"I am aware that I’m flying in the face of received wisdom here but I really wasn’t a fan of the RSC’s Richard II. The announcement of David Tennant in the leading role ensured its sell-out success (regardless of the actual strength of the production) and its transfer to the Barbican after its initial run in Stratford-upon-Avon likewise proved to be the quickest of sellers. Its critical notices have been close to superlative too, so the level of expectation was certainly high. But for all of this, I found Gregory Doran’s production to be largely quite dull, it hardly ever provoked excitement or even piqued my interest in the slow-moving telling of its tale of regime change and the corrosive effects of absolute monarchy on the individual. The inferences of a Christ-like demeanour to this King are heavily played and Tennant laps this up, irascible and irritable throughout and increasingly given to thoughts of his own divinity. Intentional perhaps, but hard to like. What the show does has it has in spades though, most notably in a trifecta of glorious supporting performances from real denizens of the theatrical establishment. Michael Pennington’s John of Gaunt, Jane Lapotaire’s Duchess of Gloucester and Oliver Ford Davies’ Duke of York are the kind of luxury casting choices a company like the RSC ought to be able to command and not a one of them disappoint – Pennington’s anger and a distraught Lapotaire proving two definite highlights."
1311,1311,Ought To Be Clowns,18/11/2012,Ian,The IDolls, Matcham Room at the Hippodrome Casino,"Since they were cast together as the divas in the musical of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, Portia Emare, Emma Lindars and Charlotte Riby have harnessed their considerable talents to form The IDolls, a musical trio who’ve built up quite a reputation for themselves with their powerhouse vocals. Their repertoire may have been born out of a mutual love for soul music but their set tonight at the Matcham Room in London’s Hippodrome casino went way further to embrace their musical theatre beginnings as well as 70s disco, Motown, self-penned tunes and contemporary pop.    So given their natural strength and the unique selling point of the gorgeous blend that they come up with, the first half of their gig felt slightly unbalanced. After a thrilling opening that featured Sister Act’s sparkling ‘Fabulous Baby’ and an epic soul/Motown medley including a fierce rendition of ‘I Heard It Through the Grapevine’, the eclectic mix that followed felt a little too, well eclectic. Giving each of the IDolls a solo spot to showcase their individual voices is an integral part of the evening, but allowing the same for each of the guest performers alongside a duet with them felt a little excessive, the interval arrived with the feeling that the group numbers were just something of a special treat rather than their raison d’être. Song choices didn’t always help either by not being as adventurous as they might: it’s hard to get excited by a medley of Aretha’s ‘Respect’ and ‘Think’ no matter excellently sung it is, and a clutch of Bond theme songs only really caught fire in its final moments. But when The IDolls are good, they are absolutely fantastic and from the final third of the first act onwards, they tore it up. An incandescent rendition of ‘One Night Only’ started a Dreamgirls section which ended with Sharon D Clarke bringing the house down with a magisterial ‘And I Am Telling You (I’m Not Going)’, full of rich throaty power and interpretative nous.  It’s their arrangements of the modern pop songs that really impress though. Beyoncé’s ‘End of Time’ gets a stomping martial beat, Christina Aguilera’s stridency is softened in a version of ‘Candyman’ that evokes a wonderfully genuine Andrews Sisters vibe and Katy Perry’s ‘Firework’ is simply transformed into a stunning acoustic torch song. The sheer diversity of exceptional talent that emerges is only bolstered by the all-too-clear affection they hold for each, creating such a mutually supportive environment for each to sing their solos – one can’t imagine any of them diva-stropping off for a solo career!"

Toneelgroep Amsterdam’s far too short stay at the Barbican is an undoubted highlight of my year – their interpretation of Scenes from a Marriage proving to be a simply extraordinary piece of theatre that I knew I had to go and see again."
1315,1315,Ought To Be Clowns,17/05/2018,Ian,As You Like It / Hamlet, Shakespeare’s Globe,"After Emma Rice’s promises to ‘rock the ground’ found little purchase with the board at Shakespeare’s Globe, it’s fair to say there have been a few people holding their breath with incoming Artistic Director Michelle Terry’s debut season about to start. One of our finest Shakespeareans, she’s placed the actor at the heart of her programming, which opens with the Globe Ensemble performing As You Like It and Hamlet in rep. And not to belabour the point, but the difference does feel like the gap between someone who sees Shakespeare as a challenge and someone who sees it an opportunity. Terry’s approach may be less ostentatious but it feels no less quietly radical in flexibility to gender, race, disability and more. Across the two productions it provides some blissful and thought-provoking  moments that feel quietly revolutionary.  An early scene in Hamlet which sees Hamlet, Horatio and Marcellus together who are all incidentally played by women (as soul-stirring a Bechdel moment as any), the way in which BSL is fully integrated into both plays and performances (there’s something gorgeous about how effortlessly Nadia Nadarajah’s Celia has the audience in stitches with sign language), the way in which designer Ellan Parry’s costumes have a timeless, transformative progression that is beautiful to look at (that embroidery!) but also intelligently matched to the character interpretations here.  For me, it was details like these that stood out most as truth be told, it isn’t the most exciting version of Hamlet you’ll ever see, despite Terry’s striking take on the title role and her mastery of the space (sod sitting down, get a groundling ticket and elbow your way to the front to have ‘To be or not to be’ delivered directly to you. swoon!). Co-directors Federay Holmes and Elle While have much more success with a joyous As You Like It, Jack Laskey’s Rosalind and Bettrys Jones’ Orlando well matched, Helen Schlesinger having a ball as the Dukes and James Garnon living his best life as Audrey. (Oh, and Pearce Quigley just being ace as ever.) "

It’s a relatively simple format – would-be musical theatre legend Harry Ledgerman is launching his new celebrity memoir with his talent agency manager wife Kristal Lee by his side and any number of friends who’ve come along to also share their secrets to becoming successful. Naturally though, success is relative and Moss’ collection of misfits  – for he plays them all – are all wonderfully deluded in their own special way. Thus the scene is set for a rapidfire kick ball change through many aspects of showbusiness, accompanied by some nifty moves (check that Chorus Line choreography) and some uncanny vocal performances as Adele, Ricky Martin and Britney sit alongside Elphaba, Piaf and Dame Judi herself."
1318,1318,Ought To Be Clowns,02/06/2016,mag9l,Everything by my side, LIFT 2016 at Crossrail Place, 
1319,1319,Ought To Be Clowns,07/01/2016,mag9l,Grey Gardens, Southwark Playhouse,"The story of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale was immortalised in a 1975 documentary called Grey Gardens. As part of the American aristocracy, insofar as their connections with the Kennedys (their niece/cousin Jackie would become Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis), they held a certain fascination but the discovery that they were living together in squalor, their fortune squandered and their East Hampton mansion overrun with cats, made them appallingly compelling subjects and consequently elevated them to cult status. That it took someone ‘til 2006 to turn it into a musical feels like a surprise, but Doug Wright’s book, Scott Frankel’s music and Michael Korie’s lyrics are more thoughtfully considered than one might expect – reflected in the success of its Tony-winning Broadway transfer from Off-Broadway – and so it’s only fitting that it is now added to director Thom Southerland’s roster of musical theatre hits at the Southwark Playhouse. The first half is taken up with a fictionalised account of life in the Bouvier Beales’ heyday in the ‘40s, centring on Little Edie’s reputed engagement to a scion of the Kennedy clan and plays out as rather conventional bio-drama. It’s engagingly performed – Jenna Russell relishing the expansiveness of Big Edie, Jeremy Legat’s pianist having been moved in to paper over the cracks of her crumbling marriage, and Rachel Anne Rayham is a sparky delight as a Little Edie with the world still at her feet – but it’s rather long-winded without delivering much psychological insight. Which is where the second act succeeds magnificently, beginning with Russell giving one of the performances of her life in ‘The Revolutionary Costume for Today’. We’ve moved on 30 years and full-blown eccentricity has set in. Russell switches to playing a deeply tragicomic Little Edie and Sheila Hancock her now mostly bedridden mother and both women are superb – Hancock spits acidic putdowns as if it’s second nature and Russell is just extraordinary as the deluded younger woman, manic and melancholy in the same breath, magisterial throughout as the twisted symbisois of the relationship between mother and daughter becomes increasingly apparent. And befittingly, supporting them is a whole raft of talent. Aaron Sidwell doubles excellently as the prim and proper Joseph Kennedy and a down-and-out teenager who befriends the older pairing; Ako Mitchell has criminally little to do but still makes the most of it as two generations of their staff; Lee Proud provides effective flourishes of choreography; and the dynamics of Tom Roger’s imposing mansion design are most thoughtful indeed, too small to contain the extroverts of early on and too large for the introverts that they become, building to a final, magnificent sense of crumbling claustrophobia. "
1320,1320,Ought To Be Clowns,23/05/2014,mag9l,Holiday/The Eisteddfod, Bussey Building,"Australian theatre hasn’t necessarily been particularly well represented on these shores, certainly in recent years, and so the opportunity to see a double bill of UK premieres at Peckham’s Bussey Building makes for an interesting evening of theatre. Raimondo Cortese’s Holiday revels in its surreal world of dark comedy as Arno and Paul slip into the shoes or should it be thongs, of Vladimir and Estragon with this Antipodean take on Waiting for Godot. Dressed in just budgie-smugglers and dipping in and out of a paddling pool, these two men while away an hour up any number of conversational avenues, throwing in snatches of obscure love songs and generally chewing the fat. Strangers when they met and strangers, probably, when they finally part, they talk about everything and they talk about nothing. It is tempting to try and read a greater purpose into Cortese’s writing but its real beauty lies in its sheer randomness.  Dreams, horoscopes, drag queens, pet peeves, Mexican cinema, the list scattershots on and on and whilst there’s much intelligence contained within the observational humour, insights into modern masculinity and national stereotypes particularly shining through, the rapid and random pace of the constant shifts – especially the musical interludes – keep Holiday mercurially inscrutable. Which is often the best thing about a holiday romance… Paul Woodson and Andrew Buckley are both great fun in capturing the essence of this moment but we soon see another side to Woodson as he reappears after the interval in Lally Katz’s The Eisteddfod, another two-hander but one which mines a completely different path. Here, the peculiar insularities of an intense brother and sister relationship are exposed through their play-acting and preparations for a performance of Macbeth. Both in young adulthood but trapped by agoraphobic fears which lock them in the disturbingly childlike fantasy world that they have conjured for themselves in which they too spin through a roll-call of characters, both real and imagined. Their mutual interdependence takes on sinister tones as they morph from siblings to friends to parents, even lovers but Katz has a keen sense of the comic edge which keeps things from getting too dark."
1321,1321,Ought To Be Clowns,03/06/2014,mag9l,Spokesong, Finborough,"Ulster playwright Stewart Parker’s play Spokesong is a curious thing indeed, melding the troubled times of the Troubles with a rather romantic tale of love, bicycles and regular people just getting on. Parker adroitly identifies that even in the most chaotic of situations with bombs exploding down the road, the business of day-to-day life doesn’t really stop and the battles that people have to face don’t always involve guns. So we see devoted bike shop owner Frank blinking less of an eye at the bombs than at local schoolteacher Daisy to whom he has taken quite the shine. And as much threat as in a balaclava comes with the arrival of his estranged brother Julian from London, a feckless photojournalist with a yen for trouble. Frank is appalled at council plans to drive a motorway right through his neighbourhood and comes up with a plan for the city to invest in free bikes instead. Not only that, but Parker delves back into time to give us the story of Frank’s grandparents who set up the shop in the late-Victorian era, and also gives us a vaudevillean commenter in the form of the Trick Cyclist who introduces a sharper comic edge and delivers the songs that are scattered throughout the play. What emerges is a keenly observed portrait of the Troubles, given both historical context and contemporary resonance in Guy Jones’ well-judged production."
1322,1322,Ought To Be Clowns,03/10/2015,mag9l,The Wars of the Roses, Rose Kingston (Nunns-splaining and overview),"First things first for this is too important an issue to be brushed under the carpet, too vital a conversation to not too have because a press release has been summarily issued, the “historical verisimilitude” justification for Trevor Nunn’s decision to cast an all-white company for his Wars of the Roses play cycle is just pure bunkum. At one point in Henry VI, a Norwegian man and a British woman appear on a balcony playing French characters but it’s OK because we’re in a theatre, they’re acting, the natural suspension of disbelief kicks in.  Similarly later on, the four sons of Richard of York appear, three played by adults and one by a boy. Historians might point out that the son played by the boy was the second oldest of York’s surviving issue but again it’s not really that important in the grand scheme of things, theatrical license is granted and it allows for more poignant drama given his ultimate fate. So the historical accuracy argument clearly has little merit, lest we need reminding that Shakespeare is fiction, and the notion that the audience couldn’t connect family trees unless everyone is the same colour is frankly insulting. Indeed, by the 72nd time an identikit bearded homme d’un certain âge in generically dour clothing rushes onto the stage (there’s probably a drinking game in there, a shot for every time a place in England is followed by an utterance – how now Suffolk, what news Exeter, ‘sup Weston-Super-Mare…) you’ll probably be wishing for some more obvious clues to distinguish the endless rollcall of passing noblemen. A friend quipped that the historical accuracy Nunn is reaching for is actually of the early 60s when Peter Hall and John Barton originally staged these adaptations and one is tempted to find some truth in that…  There is no pretending that diversity and equality at large are easy issues, achieving them is problematic and thorny but requires effort from all of us (do check out Act For Change’s Danny Lee Wynter’s response for the one and this brilliant interview with the stars of Suffragette for the other). It must be said that Nunn has previously done much good work in the field of diversity but here he has dropped the ball, particularly in the clumsy way he’s tried to Nunns-plain it away, showing that when left to its own devices, the old guard’s inclination towards much-needed change is too often unacceptably non-existent.  Now that’s off my chest, to The Wars of the Roses themselves. Adapted by John Barton for the RSC in 1963, The Wars of the Roses compresses Shakespeare’s first historical tetralogy – the three Henry VI plays and Richard III – into three plays – Henry VI, Edward IV and Richard III – which can be watched in a number of ways, including the entire trilogy on the same day. Nunn has described this as the original boxset but the joy of boxset bingeing is that you can wear your pyjamas and press pause whenever you want (which is me saying that I went on three different evenings instead). The opportunity that The Wars of the Roses gives you is to really take the long view on the dynastic powerplays of the Houses of Lancaster and York, follow the 60 or so years of constant conflict, crown-swapping, curses and child-killing in one dramatic sweep. And in two key ways, it does achieve that. Margaret of Anjou emerges as a real powerhouse of a role, a forcefully totemic figure in the face of her husband’s (Henry VI) ineffectual reign, her rise and fall stretching over the course of the full trilogy. And it’s fascinating to see Richard of Gloucester’s backstory, the twisted family dynamic that haunted and shaped him, the battle exploits that made him a leader able to become Richard III.  As Margaret, Joely Richardson is interesting casting. Her somewhat brittle quality lends itself well to the flashes of ferocity that come as she realises how hapless her Henry is (a solid Alex Waldmann), and of fearless leadership as she assumes the mantle of warrior queen in igniting conflict with York and there’s a thrill to see her as the aged prophetess of the final part, very much channeling her mother Vanessa Redgrave. She doesn’t quite have the verse-speaking gravitas to elevate the role to the epic though, especially in the face of sensational work by Alexandra Gilbreath whose distraught Queen Elizabeth offers the trilogy’s most vibrant interpretation and emotionally affecting performance. Robert Sheehan’s Richard III is also good, despite a leg brace, arm in a sling and hunch, he makes a convincing overcompensating young man, always missing out on a hug from his mother but a fierce force on the battlefield with some really quite exciting swordplay (kudos to fight director Malcolm Ranson). And having witnessed the burden of embattled kingship on the unwilling Henry VI and his own brother Edward IV (played with bustling energy by Kåre Conradi), Sheehan skilfully shows these pernicious pressures of on even this most Machiavellian of monarchs."
1323,1323,Ought To Be Clowns,23/07/2013,Ian,Talk Show, Royal Court,"‘The show must go on’. Rarely can the oft-glibly offered aphorism have possessed such poignant resonance as at the Royal Court over the past week. Alistair McDowell’s Talk Show should have marked the end of the hugely ambitious weekly rep season, with a company of fourteen actors working their way through six new plays with just a week’s rehearsal for each. But instead, the news that company member Paul Bhattacharjee had gone missing during rehearsals, being followed by the discovery of his body a week later cast the most tragic sheen over the show. The company opted to continue, initially recasting his (relatively small) role and then dedicating the remainder of the run to him. An incredibly tough decision at the best of times but sitting through the play and realising it touched so deeply on the emotional inarticulacy of generations of men, to the point where suicide becomes a viable option, there’s an almost incomprehensible poignancy about the determination to honour a colleague’s memory. In many ways, Talk Show felt like the best of the weekly rep plays. McDowall has three generations of the same family living in a cramped house – 20-something graduate Sam is jobless and centres his energies on his nightly internet chat show, usual audience 6; his father Bill is also unemployed and unable to secure even the most menial jobs and so they both live with his father Ron, a gently wise figure who has seen it all before. Into this scenario tumbles Jonah, Bill’s brother who went AWOL after an emotional breakdown and his return merely focuses the desperation of this whole household. And he does this through some powerfully emotive writing. There’s a huge amount of humour but constantly underlaid with darker notes: Ryan Sampson’s Sam is a near comic genius as the wisecracking host interviewing people like the guy from the fried chicken place down the street yet never feels more than three heartbeats from the deepest sadness, a young man unable to comprehend why he’s not been able to find his place in the world. And Jonjo O’Neill’s Jonah has a unique take on the world that is bleakly hilarious but again, the fiercely burning intensity within reminds us of the kind of pain that can never heal. Ferdy Roberts’ taciturn Bill epitomises the stoic, suffering silence that characterises so much of the interactions between these men, with a painfully observed understatement. And it is this that strikes home the hardest, the knowledge that even the people we live with and are closest to can hide the deepest feelings in their soul and find it impossible to share the pain, to look for help, to cope. In Talk Show, dramatic license allows for an intervention and the tiniest glimmer of hope; in real life, we’re reminded that things are rarely that easily resolved. "
1324,1324,Ought To Be Clowns,14/04/2012,Ian,Big and Small, Sydney Theatre Company at the Barbican,"The vehicle chosen is perhaps a bit of a surprise, given that the likes of Uncle Vanya and A Streetcar Named Desire preceded it, but it proves to be an inspired choice.Gross und Kleinis a 1978 play by (West) German playwright Botho Strauss and Martin Crimp was commissioned to create a new English adaptation simply entitled Big and Small. And as the play focuses on the epic journey of Lotte as she struggles to make sense of her place in the world, we are treated to an immense performance from Blanchett as she rarely leaves the stage for the 150 minute duration. Lotte is a woman unsure of herself in the puzzle that is modern life as her marriage to a newspaper columnist falls apart and she feels somewhat estranged from the world. Across 10 scenes, vignettes of contemporary German life, Lotte tries to make connections with neighbours, long-lost friends, strangers, to stop herself from feeling on the outside looking in. But nothing is what it cracks up to be, dreams and aspirations deemed to be hopeless as Lotte unpeels the realities of life in all its simultaneous mundanity and complexity on that elusive hunt for self-acceptance. In an accomplished company of 14, Blanchett is undoubtedly the star. As she ricochets from one scene to the next, she mines, and completely sells, a self-deprecatory humour: gawky and deglammed in an remarkably ego-free performance, she’s funny and sad, pathetic and yet endlessly moving. I was so glad to have forked out the extra cash to be front stalls to catch every gesture, every movement, every nuance in her face which was utterly worth it. There’s such depth and intelligence in her acting, that whether she flailing around in the most awkward of dance routines or seeming on the verge of finally breaking through to another person, she is never less than completely engaging. But she’s not alone. The other 13 actors cover a whirl of cameos, some brief and wordless, some more extended which offer great counterpoints to Blanchett’s Lotte. Richard Pyros’ bureaucrat Jurgen is brilliant as is Chris Ryan’s uncomplicated ‘Man in Parka’ whose penultimate scene was probably the most moving section of the show for me, the powerfully, gloriously understated ending aside. Johannes Schütz‘s design is extraordinary, especially given how little ‘set’ there is. He’s created a giant black space in which normal rules of time and space are suspended and a minimalist aesthetic employed to gorgeous effect. Using just a few pieces in each scene – a phone box, a row of chairs, an apartment block, a road – and keeping us constantly on our toes with changing perspectives, the design is practically an art installation in itself, enhanced beautifully by Nick Schlieper’s evocative lighting. And even as a latecomer to the project after the withdrawal of original director Luc Bundy, Benedict Andrew’s direction is near-flawless, somehow connecting these disparate scenes even as we travel through the non-linear, relatively narrative-free scenarios. Crimp’s adaptation employs some updating – nanotechnology, mobiles and euros are all mentioned – but simultaneously manages to retain a timeless feel, the Communist-era aesthetic remains palpable as a reminder of the context in which it was written. There’s no doubting that Big and Small will not be for everyone. So many – as I myself did – will have booked on the strength of Blanchett’s name alone with little realisation that nearly three hours of German existentialist theatre lies in wait. I can’t pretend to say I know what it all meant or what it was trying to achieve, and where some people will dislike that aspect intensely, especially since it is really not a cheap night out – regardless, it touched a chord deep inside me. It is challenging theatre, thought-provoking and obscure but daringly creative and a truly unique opportunity to see possibly one of the finest actresses in the world at the top of her game. Running time: 165 minutes (with interval)
Programme cost: £4

1325,1325,Ought To Be Clowns,16/10/2011,Ian,Off Cut Festival – The Final, Riverside Studios,"After a successful run over the last few weeks at the Riverside Studios, the Off Cut Festival reached its finale tonight and prizes awarded, including the coveted Audience Award which carries with it a commission to develop the winning play and receive a full production here in Hammersmith. The 28 plays were whittled down to the 8 most popular which then made it through to the final week to perform again and audiences were able to vote on their favourite, the announcement being made at this final showcase. A panel of industry professionals also awarded honours for the best company of actors, director and writer to complement the main prize as the audience watched each of the finalists for one final time. Having missed Group 4, I was keen to see the two plays that had made it through from that selection so that I could make up my own mind about who I thought should win. The first of these was Andrew Biss’ The Craft – a hysterical two-hander about two mutually loathing actors playing a scene with their every inner thought being spoken out loud. I loved it, it was immediate, punchy writing and crucially extremely witty. Tracy Ann Wood and Dan March were ideally suited to their roles, the only thing I would say about it was that as it was such a perfectly-formed 15 minute short, I wasn’t too sure how it could have been further developed. The other, Tanja Mariadoss’ Let There Be, I was less keen on. A scatty artist having something of a breakdown starts an illicit affair with her landlord who is something of an uncle figure in her life whilst his 14 year old daughter watches on with disgust, kissing her teeth and spitting lyrical barbs as a would-be rapper. It wasn’t that it was at all bad, I just didn’t really engage with the piece or really want to see much more of how the story might develop, although Hannah Wood’s white-girl rapping was a delight to behold. Typically then, it was Let There Be that won the Audience Award! I am clearly well out of touch, hehe but congratulations to all involved, and I will be interested to see how it develops into a fuller piece of theatre. And it was interesting to see how my reactions to the other shows had adjusted on second, or in some cases, third viewing. Rebecca A Fielding’s Bound engaged me a lot more this time round and surprisingly for me, I found Beatrice Armstrong’s Alternative Therapy a little bit moving, knowing in advance the sadness that lay at the heart of it. Ultimately, my winners would have been between Louise Taylor’s Two Rings – a play I loved from the first time we heard it as one of our Blogger’s Panel choices – and Mark Wright’s Looking For Vi. I felt there was so much potential for Two Rings, the poignancy of a relationship growing between these two women with their unlikely connection but only one of them having the opportunity to actually remember it as Alzheimer’s weaves its destructive course. And Looking For Vi felt like the most complete work over the festival, Julia St John’s assured direction striking quickly to the heart of the story, the characters and their motivations, making us laugh, ache and cry and really care about it all: of course there was an added bite to the bittersweet ending with the recent news of Betty Driver’s passing. I was extremely pleased to see that it won the acting award from the panel. All in all, I have to say that I found the Off Cut Festival to be a highly enjoyable experience throughout all my interactions with it. Initiatives that support the new in any field are to be commended, especially in this economic climate and just looking at the numbers indicates how much of a valuable resource Off Cut has made itself: twenty-eight writers, twenty-eight directors and seventy-five actors were all able to showcase their skills in front of audiences, make further connections within the industry and work within such a supportive atmosphere. My hat goes off to In Company Theatre for nurturing this festival – both in terms of how the creatives can benefit from it and also in recognising the importance of the opinions of the audience. Critics and reviewers are all very well but audiences are just as vital, if not more so, and thus engaging them in this way should ensure that the theatre that they are producing, is the theatre that people want to see. The winners
Audience award – Let There Be
Acting award – Looking for Vi
Writing award – Bound
Directing award – The Wrong Tree  "
1326,1326,Ought To Be Clowns,07/10/2013,Ian,The Boys from Syracuse, Union Theatre,"As a Rodgers and Hart musical from the late 1930s, The Boys from Syracuse is naturally full of songs you didn’t know you knew – ‘Sing for Your Supper’, ‘This Can’t Be Love’, ‘Falling in Love with Love’ – but it is also a story that you may very well be familiar with. George Abbott’s book relocates the action to Ancient Greece and refocuses it firmly onto the romantic entanglements therein but the tale is Shakespeare’s story of identical Antipholi and Dromios let loose in Ephesus – it’s a rom-Comedy of Errors, with tunes. Ben De Wynter’s production plays to the typical strengths of the Union Theatre – pulling together a sizeable ensemble full of youthful freshness, stripping back musical arrangements to their innate simplicity and creating choreography that pushes the intimate boundaries of this fringe venue. And it mostly succeeds in these three as mistaken identities abound with the arrival of Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse into the town of Ephesus, where their long-lost twins are in residence, causing mayhem with friends and family alike. Much of the comedy is played with a knowing wink, jazz hands aplenty and mugging galore. Matthew Cavendish and Alan McHale as the two Dromios are best here, their natural ebullience barely ground down by the constant misunderstandings and their various interactions with wife, to one of them at least, Luce, a twinkle-eyed scold given great life by Natalie Woods. Kaisa Hammarlund’s courtesan is the vivacious highlight though, her ‘Oh, Diogenes’ sparkles with life and feels like a direct line to old-school Hollywood glamour and glitz."
1327,1327,Ought To Be Clowns,28/04/2011,Ian,And The Horse You Rode In On, Told By An Idiot at the Barbican Pit,"Trotting into the depths of the Barbican Pit, And The Horse You Rode In On is the latest piece by innovative company Told by an Idiot. Conceived by Hayley Carmichael and Paul Hunter and created by the company, the show has the subtitle ‘a sequence of serious follies’, mixing together as it does five different narratives, weaving them together in an unlikely mishmash. These influences range from Hitchcock’s film Sabotage to a Dario Fo hostage story, from Are You Being Served to Bugs Bunny, taking in the Baader-Meinhof Gang and some of Günter Grass’ writing, this latter two pointing most directly (to my eyes at least) to what is being examined here, namely what drives people to commit extreme acts for their beliefs and the relative powerlessness we have to stop them. Told by an Idiot have been working long enough to allay any suspicions about whether their approach works and it really does, but unlikely as it may seem, the strongest part of the work is the humour: this is deeply, belly-achingly, funny stuff, there was one point where I was near-helpless with laughter. I am loathe to give things away here and words could not do them justice anyway, but Are You Being Served played in German was hysterical, followed by a sequence of scenes that were acted by three actors but voiced-over by two off-stage and riotously funny with it. The story of the Italian circus troupe making a perilous journey across the Alps and then being taken hostage, singing cheerily all-the-while was another triumph with a conclusion which, though ridiculous, made perfect sense. The company of five plus director Paul Hunter throw themselves with such unflagging enthusiasm into the show, switching between endless roles with consummate ease but Annie Fitzmaurice deserves plaudits for dressing up as a dog and getting soaking wet and then continuing on with her other roles with barely a moment’s breath. Jane Guernier’s leader of the singing troupe was another highlight but between them and also Bettrys Jones, Nick Haverson and Martin Hyder, there really was not a moment of weakness in the entire production, performance-wise."
1328,1328,Ought To Be Clowns,20/12/2019,Ian,Noises Off, Garrick Theatre,"I’ve long had my issues with farce but Noises Off managed to break through my preconceptions to genuinely make me laugh when the Old Vic revived it and then took it into the West End back in 2012. Even so, I have to say I wasn’t much enamoured by the thought of going back to it, hence me not going to the Lyric Hammersmith to catch Jeremy Herrin’s production there and only just now making it to this West End transfer at the Garrick Theatre. And after the first act, I began to wonder if I hadn’t had the right impulse initially. I’d argue it’s good but not great, leaning into conventional farce as a touring theatre company take their own farce Nothing On across the country while dealing with the repercussions of their tangled inter-relationships. It is after the interval that the play soars though, the second act takes us behind the scenes into a sensationally choreographed piece of riotous fun of the highest order. "
1329,1329,Ought To Be Clowns,18/09/2014,Ian,The Liberation of Colette Simple, Jacksons Lane,"Based on one of the numerous short plays that Tennessee Williams left behind (in this The Case of the Crushed Petunias), The Liberation of Colette Simple sees eight lyricists of different persuasions writing songs to French composer Vincent Guibert’s music to tell the story of small-businesswoman Colette. It’s an admirably ambitious project and one that is surprisingly successful as the varied writers have been given just enough leeway to stamp their own identity on their pieces but not so much that Guibert’s score can’t still unify them all. Nathalie Carrington’s Colette is resigned to middle-American obscurity when one morning she awakes to find that the outside world has intruded into her shop and ruined her flowers. From then on, nothing’s quite the same for Colette as she has to deal with the trespasser, a policeman, a nosy neighbour and the furrowed brow (if they have them) of her pet canary – all played by Gary Tushaw in an excellently diverse range of styles. And with this rupture in her daily routine comes the question, will things go back to normal? Does she even want them to?"
1330,1330,Ought To Be Clowns,18/12/2013,Ian,The Light Princess, National Theatre,"Visit number three to this most lovely of shows for me, though I’m lagging way behind the super-fans who are surely up to double figures by now. Original review is here, taster preview post from my first viewing here, and given their exhaustiveness, there’s really little else to add. The Light Princess really is the loveliest of shows and its uniqueness and complexity, the very things that turned others of, is precisely what keeps me coming back (I’ve currently got two revisits booked in before it ends…). "
1331,1331,Ought To Be Clowns,30/04/2010,Ian,Romeo and Juliet, Courtyard Theatre Stratford,"Rupert Goold’s production of Romeo and Juliet at the Courtyard in Stratford marks his first foray there since 2006, now he’s an Associate Director and directs a well-established ensemble here at the RSC in tale of a Montague and Capulet whose love for each other in a hostile world defies a long-held bloody family feud with the most tragic of consequences. Mariah Gale and Sam Troughton may seem like unconventional casting, but they work perfectly together as Juliet and Romeo. She’s a sulky teenager, rebelling at the marital fait accompli presented to her by her overbearing father (a terrifyingly chilling Richard Katz); he’s a hooded brooding soul, initially almost nerdily obsessed with Rosaline, both alone in their respective tribes but their first meeting awakens something deep inside of both of them and their chemistry together is just electric. He comes to life, dancing jigs of ecstatic joy, and she becomes alive to the possibilities of romantic and indeed sexual fulfilment. We never forget though that their’s is a tragic story, and Gale in particular is painfully strong in displaying the deepening realisation that their situation is not one that is tenable. The most memorable supporting performance comes from Jonjo O’Neill’s Mercutio, truly outrageous with his pornographic miming and his cold baiting of the Nurse, he brings a huge amount of life to the first half and also does enough to suggest that the brash exterior conceals some deeper, unspoken pain. Noma Dumezweni as the pipe-smoking Nurse and the worldly-wise Friar Laurence of Forbes Masson are also both excellent as the co-conspirators. There are plenty of Gooldian touches, my favourite probably being the astonishing Moroccan-themed masque and the halo of golden light that surrounds the couple as they finally consummate their marriage. For all the tricks and invention that one associates with him, there’s a remarkable sense of simplicity here, almost all the scenes involving Romeo and Juliet together are played on a bare stage with a minimum of fuss and it is highly effective and all the more moving for it. The only minor faults I found were the subtle video projections used, too subtle to be of any impact to me and the choice to make Christine Entwisle’s Lady Capulet run laps around her daughter’s deathbed: I can see where they were coming from in the depiction of uncontrolled grief, but it just doesn’t come off which is a shame as Entwisle is otherwise superb as the taut, chain-smoking, bewigged mother. Set in a darkly Catholic, Renaissance Italy, Tom Scutt’s highly effective design focuses on a central platform which serves multiple purposes and a staircase which alternately leads up to the balcony and down to the final tomb. Costumes are a nice mixture of period detail for the ensemble and modern dress for the lovers, which picks up nicely the idea that they are separate from the world around them. This trick is then cleverly and neatly inverted in the powerful final image. After tiptop circle seats for Antony & Cleopatra earlier in the month, this time I was in the side stalls, four rows back and I was astounded by how well the production was directed in that I might have well have looking straight onto the show, so good was the blocking and the movement around the stage. Any fears you might have about being sat on the side should be dispelled right now as you’re also closer to the action, so that was a nice surprise. Altogether, I think this was as good an interpretation of this oft-performed classic as I have ever seen. It is fresh and exciting, full of youthful exuberance and a thrilling sense of not really knowing just how far things are going to go, exemplified perfectly in the opening street battle as someone is tied to a stake, mouth stuffed with a petrol-soaked rag and a man with a flaming torch fast approaches. One is so quickly submerged into this anarchic Verona that there’s a real sense of the unknown: as for what happen to the poor soul…well you’ll have to go and see if for yourself! Just done my own review – just ridiculously good, and bear in mind I normally can't stand this play. And on the way back from the theatre my friend and I were saying pretty much what you said in the last paragraph: Considering we bloody KNOW how it's going to end, it's impressive how it makes you feel like anything could happen next."
1332,1332,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Medicine, Hope Theatre,"It’s a real gift to be able to write the kind of dialogue that manages to both leave you breathless with laughter and yet feel entirely rooted in believability. And as Ma bickers delightfully with her daughter Moira-Bridget over whether she’ll catch her death without a sweater, or the quality of the wine she’s nicked, or what they should drink that wine out of (I think this is the first play I’ve seen to mention Mooncups…), it is clear that Meghan Tyler has such skill. But Medicine is far from just fun and games and banter, the full complexity of mother-daughter relationships is explored here, right down to everything that they share. Which includes a tendency to severe depression. We first meet the pair on Warrenpoint Pier in Northern Ireland, where Ma discovers Moira on the edge – quite literally – but though every part of her wants to do something, sometimes it is just impossible to help. Off the Middle were last seen at the Hope Theatre with the utterly devastating In Other Words and wisely, Paul Brotherston’s production reunites that exceptional creative team. Will Alder’s lighting has an uncompromising harshness to it which leaves nowhere to escape, so too the inescapable sounds from Iida Aino. And Brotherston’s direction pares back all artifice to really heighten the emotion here. Writing from her own experience and performing as Moira too, Tyler spares us little of the desperation of a young woman fully in the grips of mental illness. And Lynsey-Anne Moffat is painfully effective as the mother who has found her own solution of wine and pills but when it comes to her daughter asking for help, can find nothing but anguished silence."
1333,1333,Ought To Be Clowns,23/07/2012,Ian,Playhouse Creatures, Theatre on the Fly,"The pop-up space created on the grounds of Chichester Festival Theatre to help celebrate its 50th anniversary is a curious thing, Named Theatre on the Fly and constructed solely from recycled material, its rough edges and unreserved bench seating speaks of its temporary nature but the introduction of a fully operational fly tower, whose machinery is laid bare for all to see, has a certain elegance about it. And it forms the ideal backdrop for April De Angelis’ play Playhouse Creatures which is set in, and backstage at, a seventeenth century theatre. Specifically, it takes place during the Restoration. Puritanism has ended and the theatres reopened and for the first time, women are allowed on the stage. But as we follow a group of pioneering actresses in a working company, we see the struggles, compromises and stark realities they are faced with, in this exceedingly hard-hitting environment which they bear variously with grace, bawdiness, calculated drive and an ultimate equanimity that this is a tough world for a woman. De Angelis hits on a real truth here and it is sadly as true now as it was then. Whilst embracing the progress made in women finally being allowed on the stage, grande dame of the group Mary Betterton bemoans the paucity of decent roles for older women that it exposes, she longs to play Lady M but then what lies after that. And in the playing of the role, one can imagine Alexandra Gilbreath asking the same question. Having dazzled us with her Hermione, her Olivia and her Emilia, and teased us with a scintillating “out, out, damn’d spot…” which simply demands she be cast in the Scottish Play pretty sharpish, where are the parts for her to progress onto to really test her, the types of roles that will see her male counterparts elevated to hallowed ground.    The play also follows other difficulties faced by women in the theatre, some more specific to the time. Fiona Hampton’s sharp Elizabeth Farley is determined to catch the eye of a wealthy gentleman but when a liaison leaves her expecting, she falls foul of the law that makes it illegal for a pregnant woman to appear on the stage and falls horrifyingly fast and hard. Rebecca Marshall is determined to secure her independence as an actress and spearheads a campaign to make women shareholders in the theatre and to have more female playwrights. Kirsty Besterman brings her to life with a lovely sense of self-confidence and idealism but she’s never allowed to forget she’s operating in a man’s world. And Susan Tracy’s Doll Common, watching over all as she sweeps and cleans around them but representative of the repressed generation before. But though serious issues lie at the heart of Playhouse Creatures, there’s an irrepressible sense of humour about the whole enterprise that ensures it never becomes too heavy-going. Scenes of Restoration comedies are interspersed throughout which offer an amusing insight into the types of roles women were given, Gilbreath’s Betterton gives a hilarious masterclass in acting technique which uses times of the clock and there’s lots of earthy language and frankness about the breast-baring that is expected of them all. Epitomising this latter point is Nell Gwyn, a barmaid who forced her way into the theatre and then parlayed that fame into becoming one of the King’s most powerful mistresses. Charlotte Beaumont brings a perkily effervescent energy which is hugely amusing but it isn’t always abundantly clear what point De Angelis is trying to make by having Gwyn so central, as someone who considered the theatre as a stepping stone to other things rather than focusing on the greater artistic integrity, and theatrical impulses, of the others."
1334,1334,Ought To Be Clowns,14/05/2018,Ian,H.R.Haitch, Union,"As Kensington Palace gears up for one royal wedding, Iris Theatre are jumping down the aisle first with their musical take on stately nuptuals H.R.Haitch, now playing at the Union Theatre. And though it features a mixed-race woman (like Meghan) marrying a prince, such is the development time for musicals that is actually the fact that she is a ‘commoner’ (like Kate, apparently) that proves the inspiration here. For aspiring canapé-chef Chelsea is Barking born and bred, and a strident anti-monarchist to boot. And she’s pretty excited about her suspicions that her nice-but-dim boyf Bertie is going to propose! Thing is, Bertie is actually Prince Albert – heir to the British throne and (for reasons I’m not sure we ever really understood) living incognito among the people. Will Queen Mary accept her? Can the older Princess Victoria thwart the line of succession? And what is it with politicians and pigs…?  Maz Evans’ book sets H.R. Haitch in 2011, a pre-Uber, pre-Brexit, pre-Olympics time which allows for a rapid-fire, pun-heavy opening scene in Chelsea’s father’s pub which is genuinely hilarious. And like so many comedians, the show doesn’t know quite when to stop and so much here is turned into running jokes which are done to death. The inclination to farce is best when depicting a viciously foul-mouthed Royal Family, particularly a brilliantly crude queen. And Daniel Winder’s production is best when it remains amiably daft, deepened by some rich performances and led by a break-out turn from Tori Allen-Martin as Chelsea. Superficially, she’s Essex through and through (the selfie running gag is one that does work) but Allen-Martin layers in pathos and personality by the pound. She’s fearless and funny and consistently elevates the work. Andrea Miller also succeeds vividly as the profane monarch and a randy granny with a nimble turn of…phrase."
1335,1335,Ought To Be Clowns,10/04/2020,Ian,Jesus Christ Superstar (2012 Arena Tour),,"Pre-dating the Open Air Theatre’s revelatory restaging by three years, Laurence Connor’s restaging of ALW’s 1971 rock opera lays its contemporary allusions thickly (Occupy, Guantánamo, reality TV) but right from the start, you can see how superficial it is. A busy prologue full of kinetic energy references the Occupy movement strongly but as soon as the show proper starts, it’s as if it never happens, you could cut it and never know the difference. 
Elsewhere, stretching for the modern references shows its strains – making The Temple a hedonistic nightclub has undoubted visual impact but lyrically, it makes no sense. And as we race to the finish, the prison jumpsuits and angel wings make the title song a really bizarre spectacle. Matters aren’t helped by the heavy reliance on the large video screen – a necessity in an arena, but anathema to creativity. And performance-wise, I really don’t think it is one for the ages. Fresh from winning the TV talent show Superstar, Ben Forster is palpably still feeling his way into his talent, not helped by this version capturing arena-style largesse in uncompromising detail. Subtlety is in short supply – Melanie Chisholm’s Mary Magdelene feels mis-cast, and in art as in life, the less said about Chris Moyles the better. Tim Minchin’s unique brand of anguish as Judas does register though, and Alex Hanson is naturally excellent as Pilate. But overall, I don’t think it is a treatment of the musical that stands up to rewatching unless you’re a huge fan. "
1336,1336,Ought To Be Clowns,02/10/2011,Ian,Othello, Crucible,"Forming part of the 40th anniversary season at Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre is a production of Othello which continues their ability to attract top-notch televisual talent: last year saw John Simm taking on Hamlet and here we find both Dominic West and Clarke Peters. But for all the draw of these stars of The Wire, the reason that I actually booked in the end was the casting of Alexandra Gilbreath, one of the few actresses for whom I would travel just about anywhere to see, indeed I’ve not actually got round to watching any of The Wire yet (I was all about Battlestar Galactica y’see). It is actually the first time I had seen this play on stage, it wasn’t one I ever studied and held little interest for me since then if I’m honest, but I thought I would give this one a try and the decision paid dividends for this was a truly superb production. Directed by Daniel Evans, it is a traditional rendition but far from old-fashioned as this tale of deep betrayal pulses with life and energetic drama on the wide open stage of the Crucible. West’s Iago is a brusque, plain-speaking figure, brutally up front about his proclivities and prejudices, a decision helped no end by his Yorkshire accent which also perversely makes him a more magnetic personality. This is the guy in the pub who you know you shouldn’t listen to but can’t help yourself but be won over by, his bearded visage appealing until finally unmasked as a bitter misogynist and West’s verse-speaking is superbly natural even in its brogue from t’wrong side of t’Pennines. Peters’ Othello has a slightly less successful time aurally, opting for a West Indian accent that doesn’t always lend itself to the greatest clarity though his acting is never less than scintillating, the way he grows increasingly colder towards Desdemona is a masterclass in subtlety. Alexandra Gilbreath’s Emilia, the put-upon wife of Iago, was everything I dreamed it could be and then some: a slamdunk fosterIAN nomination for the end of the year if ever there was one. A beautifully rounded characterisation that makes one understand so much more about her: the loneliness she feels as a soldier’s wife, the shame she feels for not being able to bear him a child, the flirtatiousness of a passionate woman and the profound guilt she comes to feel as her husband’s machinations become increasingly clear to her. She bonds well with Lily James’ first-rate Desdemona, another strong performance especially in a beautifully sung Willow. But this is a production that is truly strong across the board: Gwilym Lee’s Cassio swaggers with a lascivious twinkle in his eye that suggests Othello might not be imagining everything, Brodie Ross’ Roderigo makes for an endearing fall-guy and who can blame him for going for so many hugs from Iago! Evans is unafraid to full embrace the physicality of the play as well, so there’s many a tussle, flashes of swordplay and the abiding sense that violence is never far away. And when it finally explodes in Desdemona’s death, we are spared none of the brutality of that shocking moment – a brief moment of staging beauty is quickly flipped to horrific effect. Morgan Large’s set is highly effective, the huge stone wall at the rear and the Moorish-inspired mosaic of the floor subtly shifting in emphasis as we move from Venice to Cyprus and further events transpire; Alex Baranowski’s music is highly dramatic and suits the swift scene changes perfectly, ensuring the pace never flags and likewise Lucy Carter’s lighting is appropriately atmospheric. Occasionally I do wonder if the trips out of London are worth it, the travel eating up so much time, but for productions like this, I can say that it really is worth the effort: highly recommended."
1337,1337,Ought To Be Clowns,26/04/2014,mag9l,Duet for One, Octagon,"If we’re making lists about our favourite plays, I would have to say that Tom Kempinski’s Duet for One would be guaranteed a place in the top ten, if not higher. The Almeida’s 2009 production was exemplary and the touring version from 2012 proved it was no one hit wonder for me so the announcement of Bolton’s Octagon Theatre mounting the show in rep with another Kempinski play – Separation – was too much to resist. The play is loosely based on Jacqueline Du Pré’s battle with the multiple sclerosis that ended her career as a brilliant cellist and takes the form of a series of therapy sessions between Stephanie Abrahams, a haughty violinist who also has MS and her therapist Dr Feldmann. Kempinski tenderly explores the horrors of the psychological as well as the physical effects of such a debilitating condition, asking of us all what we would do if rendered unable to do what we loved the most. As Stephanie, Clare Foster is excellent. Younger than the actresses I’ve previously seen take on the role, she really goes for the jugular in displaying all of the spikiness of a wealthy, top-tier artist who has previously been immune from the harshness of real life, only slowly revealing the layers of humanity that are exposed by her condition, the mood swings that she has to surrender to as she finally comes to accept that she can no longer play her beloved violin, something that had become an extension of her very self. And against her, Rob Edwards plays Feldmann with the right level of balance. Initially the passive listener trying to draw out his patient’s story, the second act sees him come into his own as he struggles with the hopelessness of her situation and the powerlessness he feels. Director Elizabeth Newman imbues the production with a remarkable physical energy given the essentially static nature of these encounters and even manages to mostly deal with the difficulty of the in-the-round setting."
1338,1338,Ought To Be Clowns,20/01/2018,Ian,Amadeus, National,"Though Rufus Norris’ tenure hasn’t managed to nail a new writing hit in the Olivier, it has had considerable success in finding revivals to fill this voluminous space. Follies was a standout from last year, particularly in how Vicki Mortimer’s design swelled to magnificent heights and late in 2016, it was a glorious production of Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus that rose to the occasion. So it is no real surprise to see that show return to the schedule, indeed the surprise was that it might even have gotten better. That this is Michael Longhurst’s debut in this theatre makes it all the more impressive and I wouldn’t be surprised if his name doesn’t soon become one of the ones bandied around the round of musical chairs that is London artistic directorships. And his decisions here remain as pinpoint accurate in nailing the psychological torment at the heart of this drama, from the toxicity of Salieri’s jealousy, Mozart’s own struggles in dealing with his genius, and how society also has its difficulties in its treatment of those it elevates. 
These are played out near-perfectly by Lucian Msamati’s pompous Salieri and Adam Gillen’s punkish Mozart, both returning from that original production (here’s my review from then), supported by a vibrant turn from newcomer Adelle Leonce as Mozart’s lover then wife Constanze and Sarah Amankwah and Ekow Quartey as the Venticelli. The use of the Southbank Sinfonia to add real orchestral heft to the production remains a real master-stroke too, particularly in the daunting majesty of the tableau that closes Act 1.  In short, you really shouldn’t miss this now you’ve been granted another chance to see it!"
1339,1339,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2017,mag9l,The Rover, Swan,"I’ve not been heading up to the RSC with that much regularity recently, but I’ll go anywhere for Alexandra Gilbreath and given that The Rover had the added bonus of Joseph Millson, the trip was a no-brainer. It also helped that it was written and directed by women, not that frequent an occurrence in Stratford. And written not just by any woman, Aphra Behn was one of the first professional female playwrights and this play dates from 1677. And directed by Loveday Ingram, it is a sprightly bit of fun indeed. Set in the heady mist of carnival time, all bets are off as the normal rules of society are suspended. Three sisters disguise themselves to escape the strict futures ahead of them, and a group of Englishmen arrive in port ready and willing to create the lads on tour archetype. Chief among the sisters is Hellena, due to enter a nunnery so more than happy to make the acquaintance of the rakish and randy Willmore. Only problem is, the courtesan Angellica Bianca has been there, done that and got the t-shirt, and it is the sparkiness that comes from this central trio that makes the play sing. Faye Castelow’s Hellena is highly charismatic, Millson’s titular rogue is a hugely dynamic stage presence flirting irresistibly with cast and audience alike and Gilbreath brings her customary intelligence to the older woman, full of emotional heft which really deepens the tone."
1340,1340,Ought To Be Clowns,07/04/2012,Ian,The Legend of Captain Crow’s Teeth, Unicorn,"The Legend of Captain Crow’s Teeth haunts the campsite where nine-year-old Will and his four brothers have spent many a family holiday. And at the Unicorn Theatre near London Bridge, Matthew Lenton has devised a family-friendly, if not just a little spooky, adaptation of Eoin Colfer’s novel of the same name which provides a welcome opportunity for a family trip during the Easter holidays. Will’s holiday is largely spent negotiating his pesky younger brothers and their Haribo-hiding ways and trailing in awe of his older brother Marty who is awfully fond of a ghost story, especially around the glowing rocks known locally as Captain Crow’s Teeth. But the tale of the angry pirate ghost searching for the 9 year old cabin boy who killed him 300 years ago lingers long in Will’s mind and as he happens to be 9 as well, he’s more than a little anxious. The play is swift, over and done with in 60 minutes, but is beautifully done. A world of daring imagination is nicely evoked in the simplest of ways: a picnic table is inverted to become a bed for four, a duvet becomes the rippling waves of the sea. And there’s a neat parallel in the way that rational scientific explanations for the underwater phosphorescence are thrown up against imaginations run wild and childhood fears endlessly multiplied. Alasdair Hankinson makes a hugely endearing Will, warmly inclusive and sensitively pitched, guiding us through the story and always ensuring he’s carrying the audience with him. Ashley Gerlach’s elder brother relishes tormenting his younger sibling with a hugely realistic glee and Cath Whitefield and Itxaso Moreno are masses of fun as the manic younger brothers. As the towering, black-clad Captain Crow, Miles Yekinni is suitably terrifying (though with a pet crow called Colin too) and several of the actors double up to great effect too."
1341,1341,Ought To Be Clowns,10/12/2009,Ian,A Christmas Carol, King’s Head,"Of all the various productions of A Christmas Carol that can be found dotted around London this winter, I doubt any are as well suited to their venue as MokitaGrit’s production at the King’s Head Theatre on Islington’s Upper Street. There’s something old-fashioned about this cosy theatre pub and it suits this Victorian, gothic-inflected version of Charles Dickens’ famous story down to the ground. Opening with, and then continually narrated by Dickens himself (played by a genial Nigel Lister), trying to convince a publisher and a pub full of locals that he has a story worth telling, a cast of 16 effortlessly sing, play and dance their way through this familiar tale with such inventiveness and vibrancy that you could not feel more festive by the end if you tried. Using every inch of available space, the cast flow around the full scope of the stage and even up and down the aisles with such ease and confidence, bringing the audience with them right into the heart of the action. I loved the arrival of the chain-dragging spirits, though its probably not for the faint of heart, and there was some clever use of puppetry and props throughout which kept the dynamic energy going. Jonathan Battersby’s Scrooge is nicely curmudgeonly and blessed with some excellent facial expressions (one mustn’t forget that Scrooge actually spends a lot of this story just watching things) and his flight over London with Kilke Van Buren’s Cinderella-like Ghost of Christmas Past is beautifully realised. Adam Stone’s Bob Cratchit, a character that is impossible not to like, is also really well accomplished, his concern for his family movingly played.
What Phil Wilmott has cleverly done is ensure that much of the music is instantly recognisable, as in places he has written new lyrics over familiar Christmas tunes, and elsewhere traditional carols are used which allows the audience easy access into the emotion of the material. And what emotion is evoked: a beautifully moving and truly affecting ‘In The Bleak Midwinter’ gave me chills and a ‘Silent Night’ with a candlelit vigil for the dying Tiny Tim was touchingly emotional without being mawkish. But there were lighter moments too: Christmas in Camden Town was a hoot and is surely destined to become a staple song of the season if it gets into the right hands (the Christmas in New York team would be my bet) and the choreography that accompanied The Miser’s Dead was well-drilled and visually pleasing."
1342,1342,Ought To Be Clowns,31/03/2018,Ian,All Or Nothing, Ambassadors,"I have to hold my hands up, I couldn’t name you more than one Small Faces song if I tried, and that’s only because of the M-People cover of ‘Itchycoo Park’ from my formative years. Which is the main reason that it has taken me this long to getting round to see All Or Nothing, the nature of a jukebox musical tending towards existing fans of the music. Of course, the ideal is that a show can break out to expand its reach to a wider audience (in a way that Sunny Afternoon did, for me at least), and I’m not sure that All or Nothing quite has those chops. Introduced and quasi-narrated by an older Steve Marriott, the band’s frontman, who reflects back on the band’s rise to fame with something close to rose-tinted glasses. Carol Harrison’s book clearly has a lot of biographical information to fit in, but using this approach to storytelling skews it too much to his perspective. The sacking of original organist Jimmy Winston for example, gets passed off quickly as a result of him getting above his station but to my uninitiated eye, it would have been more interesting to explore the lash of egos, delve into more of the arrogance that is often assumed to come with being the ‘star’. Its comedy is sketched in very broad strokes (the less said about its depiction of the north, the better) and there’s not quite the requisite level of dramatic tension that it seems to be building up to. But musically, the show packs a real punch as Samuel Pope’s younger Steve, plus bandmates Stefan Edwards, Stanton Wright and Alexander Gold deliver hit after hit and clearly delighting the fans around me."
1343,1343,Ought To Be Clowns,23/02/2011,Ian,Great Expectations, ETT at Watford Palace,          
1344,1344,Ought To Be Clowns,13/03/2016,mag9l,Correspondence, Old Red Lion,"And what activity it is. Clever enough to not really need to revise for his upcoming GCSEs, 16-year-old Ben spends most of his spare time on Xbox Live but when his Syrian friend Jibreel disappears from his contact list, he decides to launch a rescue mission from his Stockport bedroom. But it’s not quite as simple as all that, Torn between squabbling divorced parents, Ben’s home life has been significantly troubled and as it is 2011, the murmurings of civil unrest abroad herald what would soon be known as the Arab Spring. Lucinda Burnett’s Correspondence thus straddles two immensely weighty subjects. The power and potential of mass protest in a nascent revolution and how we connect to it as global citizens, but also the complexity and cruelty of incipient psychosis and again, the difficulties it poses in connecting with others. Over a running time of just 80 minutes, the play doesn’t always manage to engage and interrogate fully the enormity of these issues, relying on a plot contrivance or two too many to convince that they’re being explored efficaciously. Blythe Stewart’s direction realises a good deal of Burnett’s ambition, not least in emphasising the video game influences in Bethany Wells’ striking set complete with character recharge stations and the blinking lights designed by Christopher Nairne. In this world, Joe Attewell delivers a powerfully committed performance as Ben, his shifted perspective allowing him to detach from reality and begin his outlandish journey, even collecting a fellow player in the form of Jill McAusland’s gobby bully Harriet, her character progression one of the play’s strongest aspects."
1345,1345,Ought To Be Clowns,04/09/2011,Ian,The Kitchen, National Theatre,"The Kitchen was one of Arnold Wesker’s first plays and follows on from the Royal Court’s well-received (if not by me) Chicken Soup with Barley in a year which has been something of a revival for Wesker. Written in 1959 and inspired by his own experiences of working in the catering industry, it is set in 1957 in the basement kitchen of a large London restaurant, the Tivoli. The dynamics of a swirling multi-cultural mass of chefs, waitresses and kitchen porters are exposed as they slowly build to the mad rush of a huge lunchtime service. Playing in the Olivier at the National Theatre, this was a late preview performance. Director Bijan Sheibani has assembled a cast of 30 who rush about Giles Cadle’s circular kitchen set with increasing fervour as prep turns into service and the banter with all its personal enmities, tribal groupings and rivalries between kitchen staff and dining-room staff becomes increasingly fraught, and of course largely forgotten as the rush passes and the calm of the afternoon allows for a more reflective atmosphere. The less intense evening service provides a final act is no less dramatic though as slow burning stories finally explode. Given it is part of the Travelex season, I don’t know what I was expecting but I did find myself disappointed at the lack of real food on stage! There’s lots of clever sound effects and pans that appear to be bubbling on gas stoves but the ‘cooking’ is all done through mime and not just that, much of the movement of the actors is synchronised, occasionally freeze-framing to allow mini-scenes to play out and then restarting. Matters culminate at the end of the first act in a fully choreographed 15 minute routine at the height of the lunch service, somewhere between a Viennese ballroom and the fanciest wind-up music box. Visually it is stunning but it doesn’t mask the fact that for the first half, little of any consequence has actually happened: the tiniest snapshots into the lives of these workers is all we really get. As the second half begins, the focus ends up settling mainly on the manic, young German chef Peter, specifically his frustrated love affair with the married English waitress Monique but also his relationship, or lack thereof, with the other workers, his over-compensatory behaviour a reflection of how difficult it must have been to be a German out of Germany in the 1950s. To be honest, I wasn’t really a fan of Tom Brooke’s performance here, too self-consciously intense in that I never quite forgot that he was acting a role, something that could improve with time to be sure but it was also rooted in his story not being particularly well fleshed out by Wesker – his approach means that everything is touched on briefly in this replication of a working day rather than being a dramatisation of the issues, the touching relationship between Peter and the Jewish workers being one example that was ripe for further exploration. My attention was drawn more to the sub-plots and some excellent flashes of characters in the large supporting cast: the endearing Katie Lyons as Monique was movingly matter-of-fact about her situation and the abortion issue was one I would have liked to have seen more of; Samuel Roukin is astoundingly good as pastry chef Paul, floundering after being left by his wife and feeling lost in a society that doesn’t seem to reciprocate his innate kindness and Rory Keenan’s Irish chef, thrown in at the deep end on his first day, is replete with quirky yet realistic personality. There’s also good work from Ian Burfield’s grumpy butcher, Tricia Kelly’s redoubtable veg lady Bertha and Siobhán McSweeney’s sweet dessert lady. Altogether I have to say that The Kitchen left me rather disappointed. The cast work hard with very little but the idea of this mini-community being representative of the world of work or industrial relations isn’t one that really works, the play is stronger at suggesting the lives of the working classes in the late 50s in a country still struggling to escape the shadow of the war and in a society still waiting to be liberated by the social revolution of the 60s. That said, it has moments of visual grace, the clever way the orders appear on the main set and the sweeping choreography with its first-act-ending coup de théâtre almost make up for it. Almost. It's a strange play, and, yes, for the first half nothing really happens. There's a few half plots which reman half plots in the second half. The choreography is spectacular, and, without it, the play would sag. The second half, at least, has a narrative trajectory and I found myself warming to the play at last. The temporal representations of a kitchen were drawn perfectly; that melancholy return to work after a few hours off in the afternoon was spot-on.We were sat in the cheap seats in the circle, and from that distance it took awhile to recognise each of the characters lost in a vast set, which needed to revolve rather than stay static. If you view the play as a snapshot of London (like Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway) it works wonderfully."

1347,1347,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Little Wars,,"Raising money in aid of Women For Refugee Women, Ginger Quiff Media in collaboration with the Union Theatre have brought together a stellar cast of some of our finest actors for a rehearsed reading of Steven Carl McCasland’s play Little Wars. It is a weighty and wordy play but streaming passes last for 24 hours so you can always give yourself the interval(s) you need. The drama imagines a dinner party between six women of considerable note. Its the early 1940s and Gertrude Stein and her girlfriend Alice Toklas are hosting an intimate soirée at their salon in the French Alps. Writers Lillian Hellman and Agatha Christie are expected but when the bell rings, it is anti-fascist freedom fighter Muriel Gardiner at the door. What follows is a densely layered combination of character study and historical thriller as the intense connections, and in some cases outright rivalries, between the women are explored alongside the growing threat of World War II to the Jewish community, of which several of the party are a member. It’s a lot to pack in over two hours and the essential static nature of a reading doesn’t always feel like the best fit."
1348,1348,Ought To Be Clowns,08/05/2016,mag9l,The Local Stigmatic, Old Red Lion,"There’s something eerily prescient in Heathcote Williams’ play The Local Stigmatic as it talks about people ‘following’ famous people to get all the news and gossip from their Z-list lives. Prescient, because it was written in 1966, before any of the four founders of Twitter had even been born, never mind co-opted the verb ‘to follow’, and before the celebrity culture that is so prevalent today had really taken hold. From their South London bedsit with its poster-filled walls, Graham and Ray are two of the angry young men so beloved by the kitchen sink drama movement of the time. Constantly poring over the pages of the newspaper, they’re either getting tips for betting on the dogs, soaking up every last tidbit of celebrity gossip or arguing in the detached, sociopathic manner that makes them a menace to society, a threat that becomes all too real when they bump into a minor actor in the pub.  Michael Toumey’s production for the Old Red Lion marks the 50th anniversary of the play and though there’s elements of the storytelling that remain powerfully pertinent today, there’s also a feeling of dustiness about it. The linguistic obliqueness is Pinteresque, relationships elliptical if not evasive, even its design feeling like a distinct nod to its period origins. And in all honesty, to use the technical term, it just didn’t do it for me. "
1349,1349,Ought To Be Clowns,05/09/2012,Ian,You Me Bum Bum Train 2012,,"And once again I loved it. It pushed and challenged me, and thrilled and excited me in equal measure – again I did something I never thought I’d ever do and such a feeling is wonderful to experience, especially in the heady rush that is the speedy journey on the train. Familiarity with the concept does dull some of its effect though, even just knowing the kind of thing to expect means that one can prepare a little for it which robs some of the spontaneity that made the first time so special. What replaces the sense of fear, for me at least, is a more relaxed attitude that means you can play with the format and push the boundaries a little – I was determined to make at least two sets of performers corpse, as I did last time, and I managed it 😉 So, this really will be the last time I ride the train. I don’t think it will ever change enough to really make doing it again truly worthwhile despite it being genius amounts of fun, and I’ve gotten more pleasure from chatting to the people who have done it for the first time, both my friends and the people who I chatted to afterwards. It’s all about getting in there as quickly as you can with the tickets though, so keep your eyes peeled and I’ll let you know as soon as I do about any future dates. Good to hear that you've decided to selflessly offer the experience to others rather than just go on the ride yourself. You're quite right that the first experience has the most impact. I literally couldn't sleep the night after my ride, however I know this wouldn't ever be the same if I went through on subsequent shows. Kudos also for giving some of the cast a rark up. IMHO, it should be challenging for both sides – audience and performers. Since I've now been a cast member in the current Stratford incarnation it is interesting (to us) how different types of people participate, and it seems clear that those who get the best experience are those who approach it with a completely open mind, and don't try to second guess the situations or wind up the performers."
1350,1350,Ought To Be Clowns,03/03/2011,Ian,Live at the Studios – Julie Atherton in Concert,,"It is no secret that I am a little bit of a fan of Julie Atherton (although I did have to take her name off the display of tags at the bottom of this page because it was making all the other ones look so small!) and I love that she seems to be constantly working, meaning that there are endless opportunities to see her perform or listen to her recordings. I very much enjoyed Ordinary Days but I was more than a little annoyed when a series of late night post-show cabarets were announced for Wednesday nights, after I’d booked my ticket (for a Thursday) and my diary was already booked up for the Wednesdays she was playing. But as it turned out, Caryl Churchill’s Fen wasn’t too long a play and so a quick tube and a little bit of running from Charing Cross to the Trafalgar Studios later, I made it in the nick of time to her final cabaret show and I could not have been more glad to make it as it really was a superb evening (not least because she was sat RIGHT NEXT TO ME at one point in the evening and I totally managed not to lose it). The beauty of cabarets is that they can be mixed to showcase all sorts of things, they’re not beholden to a strict format or theme beyond those that are self-imposed and so it was tonight. We got a nice smattering of cabaret standards delivered with her customary vocal precision (does anyone do wordy comic songs better than her? I think not) and some tracks from her latest album No Space For Air, including the beautiful ‘Never Saw Blue Like That’ (which random pointless trivia fact fans, was one of my big sister’s favourite songs way back cos it was on the Dawson’s Creek 2 soundtrack!). But this freedom to do the songs she wants meant that we were also treated to one of the songs that didn’t make it onto the album, a tender version of Damien Rice’s ‘Cannonball’, her take on the written-for-a-man ‘Someone To Fall Back On’ by Jason Robert Brown and her playing around with Wicked’s ‘For Good’ with Oliver Tompsett as Glinda, a surprisingly effective choice. Other guests included Steven Webb who sang a lovely solo rendition of ‘Left Spain’ from recent new musical Departure Lounge before duetting on ‘The Argument’ from Stiles & Drewe’s Just So, which in turn led to my personal highlight, Julie’s powerfully moving ‘Wait A Bit’ which breaks my heart every time I hear it. Tom Parsons (Mr Julie Atherton himself) also got a turn in the spotlight with a quietly impassioned take on ‘Lilac Wine’ which came after a witty duet about being hungover which I liked but have to admit I’d hadn’t heard before. The affection and esteem with which she is held by her contemporaries is evident with the range of guests who have performed with her over the course of her cabarets, but it was brilliantly amusing to see Tompsett and Webb re-enacting a story of her clambering over musicians to remind herself of words she thought she had forgotten, quickly followed by Tompsett making a slight snafu with his own lyrics in ‘For Good’ and then Atherton making her own mistake whilst mocking his – truly a sitcom in the making here! I could wax lyrical about the many ways in which I love Julie Atherton for days, so many of which were in evidence here: the beauty of her voice, her passion for new musical theatre and taking risks on new writers, the frankness with which she talks about a certain breed of theatre producer, her support for the ‘It Gets Better’ campaign, introducing Avenue Q into my life, even the way she represents Lancashire (woo!). For me though, I think it is mainly the way in which she commits so fully to the words and emotions of whatever it is she is singing, one cannot help but be drawn into her world whilst she is on the stage and boy, is it a beautiful world. And it is that little moment before she delivers the final line in so many of the songs that shows how magical and exciting a performer she really is. Jealous! Would have loved to have gone to that. Thanks for sharing! Great review! I was there last night too (and also on 16/2). Both cararets were brilliant. Stevie Webb was at both, and Paul Spicer was there on the 16th. I've been mulling over what made the shows so special. Julie's voice is outstanding and her stage presence is mesmerising, but there's something else too, and it only hit me today.Not one of the fantastic singers on the stage came across as an ""I am"" – very refreshing in this day and age.It was wonderful to see performers of such calibre getting along so well and showing great support for each other.If the cabarets had gone on for 4 hours, it still wouldn't have been long enough! I was wondering when you'd make it to one of the cabarets!  I REALLY enjoyed last week's show and wish I could have made it to more.  Last week she sang Lance Horne's ""Anywhere But Here"" with Anna-Jane Casey and it was magical.  Her passion for new writing is infectious.  I would imagine a performer of her calibre could easily find a steady, more lucrative, job in a long-running show but that's clearly not where her heart lies.  The benefit for us is that we can enjoy evenings like this in some very intimate venues."
1351,1351,Ought To Be Clowns,31/03/2012,Ian,Stories Before Bedtime – April Fools, Criterion,"Although a regular home to The 39 Steps, the Criterion Theatre has been expanding its programme of theatrical events with interviews, critic panels and play readings taking place in the afternoon – the last of which I attended earlier this month. They also have a late night event, Stories Before Bedtime, which features readings of short stories from a variety of writers, loosely based around a theme. This was one was entitled April Fools and included works from Martin Amis, Irvine Welsh and Tom Basden. The big draw of the night was Andrew Scott, who delivered a highly energetic and nuanced performance of an excerpt from Martin Amis’ tale of adolescent shenanigans The Rachel Papers. Scott is such an engaging performer that one could imagine him reading anything to great effect, but he really was superb at capturing the gawky awkwardness and tortured travails of teenage sexuality and negotiating that oh so tricky task of talking to girls. With a wry warmth and a knowing humour, he brought huge personality and likeability to our protagonist and definitely made the evening worthwhile. Tom Basden’s readings of three of his own short stories #6, #2 and #10 if you’re interested, were scattered throughout the programme and were another highlight of the evening. His (obvious) familiarity with the work meant his readings were by far the smoothest and most relaxed, but they also revealed a beautifully balanced sense to his writing. His topics often embrace the absurd but they are also rooted in a world of authentic emotion, which lends them an often unexpectedly powerful heft. His play There Is A War which I caught at the Paintframe at the National last summer suggested that he was a writer with much potential and this would seem to reinforce that view (he’s also not half as a performer too). And then there was Billy Boyd’s reading of The Granton Star Cause from Irvine Welsh’s The Acid House. I really wasn’t a fan of this, for several reasons. Welsh’s writing is crudely essayed and felt largely quite unimaginative in its revenging tone and characterisation of God as a bitter drunkard so I didn’t care much for the story; its reception by the audience was ridiculously overblown, every sexual reference garnered a distasteful over-reaction and the laughter at the racial reference is best left untouched; and though possibly not entirely his fault, Boyd very much played up to the audience, milking laughs through mugging rather than letting the words speak for themselves. Just not my cup of tea at all. I can see the thought behind the concept, in their words to “transport the audience back to when being read aloud to before bedtime was a fundamental part of one’s daily life”, but much as I love Hendricks gin (with Fever Tree tonic and a slice of cucumber natch) did not form part of my bedtime ritual. Whilst I accept the need for sponsorship, providing free alcohol (a G+T can be gotten from the bar on production of your ticket) at a late night event leads it down a certain path and here created an audience atmosphere that I found alienating – many were laughing hysterically from the very outset and seemingly at the most random of things – and at times inappropriate – applauding an actor’s entrance narks me no end. That said, Stories Before Bedtime is undeniably a great chance to see some fab actors doing something a bit different and who could say no to a free gin. I don't think it was the alcohol that led to the slightly hysterical audience, rather than the presence of Mr Scott – he has garnered quite the young, female fanbase through his work on Sherlock and I did notice the demographic seemed rather skewed… I agree with most of your points here anyway, particularly Tom Basden – total an eye opener, I'd never heard of him but would love to read more of his work."
1352,1352,Ought To Be Clowns,23/10/2020,Ian,Now. Here. This., Golden Goose Theatre,"Truth be told, my first thought on hearing that a new theatre was opening in London was ‘do we really need another one?’. Then I clocked the address in Camberwell and realised that I could add it to the list of theatres that I can walk to in under 10 minutes (the White Bear, the Blue Elephant, the Ovalhouse as was…) which kinda goes to my first point there… And you do have to admire the gumption that goes with opening a new venue in the middle of a pandemic (I recommend this article on that topic) and so I happily made my way to the Golden Goose Theatre to catch their second ever show Now. Here. This.. All credit to the staff for ensuring a safe and friendly environment and even with its capacity reduced, the new auditorium feels ripe with potential, particularly with a pleasingly large, high stage which immediately sets it apart from many a fringe venue. The theatre’s musical debut comes with the likeable Now. Here. This., a show with music and lyrics by Jeff Bowen and a book by Hunter Bell and Susan Blackwell who previously collaborated on [title of show]. It is another four-hander,  set in the Museum of Natural History where four friends sing about the meaning of their lives whilst learning about the meaning of life. And directed by Anthony Underwood with some sprightly choreography from Tessa Guerrero and sterling musical direction from Matthew Herbert, a company of four fresh new faces acquit themselves well."
1353,1353,Ought To Be Clowns,21/08/2015,mag9l,The Trial, Young Vic,
1354,1354,Ought To Be Clowns,22/08/2018,Ian,Emilia, Shakespeare’s Globe,"Three weeks on holiday and completely off social media have been bliss but within seconds of switching back on, it was hard to miss the buzz around Emilia so I did the right thing and booked myself in at the Globe. And though I’d been forewarned, I still wasn’t quite prepared for just how much Morgan Lloyd Malcolm’s brand new play would so thoroughly shake the ground on which it was performing. Ostensibly, Emilia is a piece of historical biography, a deep dive into the life of Emilia Bassano, a writer who was one of the first Englishwomen to publish an original collection of poems and as contemporary of Shakespeare, a possible inspiration to the Bard. With hard facts about her few on the ground, Lloyd Malcolm toys with this to suggest that that inspiration may have extended beyond giving her name to several of his characters across to providing a literary source from which to crib. But before you get too hung up on the speculative verve here, the writing is very much rooted in Emilia’s experience and by extension, any and every woman who has had a man stand in her way. Thus the play is a tender exploration of one spectacular woman’s experience in battling the seventeenth century patriarchy but also a ferocious call to arms across the ages to burn the whole system right down. Nicole Charles’ production is intuitively alive to every beat of this. Her Emilia is cross-cast between Leah Harvey, Clare Perkins and Vinette Robinson (all fantastic btw), emphasising how this really isn’t just one woman’s story. And using an all-female reinforces the inherent manifesto – there’s something wonderfully irreverent about the takedown of Shakespeare’s fragile masculinity as deftly portrayed by an inspired Charity Wakefield."
1355,1355,Ought To Be Clowns,28/03/2012,Ian,Filumena, Almeida,"Eduardo De Filippo’s 1946 play Filumena starts off with the title character on her deathbed, finally having married the man with whom she has lived for the last 27 years. But all is not as it seems: he’s a wealthy businessman but she’s been his mistress, a former prostitute who has inveigled him into nuptial promises after seeing his attention waver elsewhere. And upon the deal being sealed, she makes a miraculous recovery and reveals that she has three sons who need taking care of. As truths spill out from all sides, we see the sacrifices that women are willing to make for their children and the ingenuity they need to play men at their own game. Michael Attenborough takes on the directorial duties here at the Almeida in this new colloquial version by Tanya Ronder which sits a little at odds with the 1940s Naples setting but it is structurally where the play really feels somewhat curious. The first act plays out well, setting up the story and building up the necessary drama, but then we return after the interval to a very short second act which has jumped 10 months into the future and feels rather disconnected from what has gone before. The tone of the play shifts away from the darkness suggested by the social realism into an easy comic mood which does a disservice to the people working so hard to unearth an emotional depth here. Chief amongst these is Samantha Spiro (an actress whom I adore in musicals but have yet to experience quite the same thrill from her in a straight play) who struggles a little to make Filumena more than just a calculating schemer, until the play changes around her to allow to play to her strengths at generating huge emotional warmth. Clive Wood likewise does as well as he can with Domenico whose certainties are seriously challenged by the machinations of his mistress, but this portrayal of Italian masculinity is strangely neutered, lacking any sense of believable anger or threat. Sheila Reid’s Rosalia has some amusingly spiky contributions but along with the trio of men playing Filumena’s brood, is given little opportunity to rise above the sort of contributions more at home in a shaky BBC sitcom – not funny enough to really make us laugh, not tragic enough to really make us feel."
1356,1356,Ought To Be Clowns,21/03/2011,Ian,Michael Bruce – Unwritten Songs album launch, Delfont Room,"In the Delfont Room at the Prince of Wales Theatre, there is often a Sunday night treat to be found and this week saw the launch of Unwritten Songs, the debut album by Michael Bruce featuring a whole host of West End stars, many of whom were in attendance to perform the songs they sing on the album, including Julie Atherton, Alexia Khadime, Anna-Jane Casey and Mark Evans and some other special guests too, including Caroline Sheen. Bruce is a composer who has had his own West End showcase, musicals playing at Edinburgh, is resident composer at the Bush Theatre and has written the score for shows like the National Theatre’s Men Should Weep and the forthcoming David Tennant/Catherine Tate Much Ado About Nothing, so it is safe to say this is a man who is going places. His songwriting covers many bases, but he is particularly strong at the comedic songs and his repertoire is already full of choice gifts for the more daring cabaret performer: ‘Portrait of a Princess’ (formerly titled ‘In A Disney Way’) was written especially for Julie Atherton and plays perfectly to her inimitable strength at witty story-songs, if for some crazy reason you only buy one song off this album, this would be the one. But there’s also the faux-operatic ‘Continental’ delivered with a great wry humour by Emily Tierney and the newly written ‘The Musical Theatre Song’ which borrows the rapid-fire structure of Sondheim’s ‘(Not) Getting Married Today’ as a musical theatre fan breathlessly lists all the shows she loves, delivered almost without fault by Anna-Jane Casey. Bruce clearly enjoys challenging his singers and when they are of this calibre, then why the hell not. Expansive balladry was covered with songs like the gorgeous ‘Children’, performed here by Zoe Rainey, and Ashleigh Gray’s stirring ‘My Kind of World’, both really benefitting from the presence of a string quartet. Having a band onstage too allowed things to rock out (a little), with Ross Hunter’s ‘Don’t Want To Leave You Now’ and a stripped down acoustic version of Julie Atherton’s ‘Blind’ from her second album No Space for Air, really showing his versatility as a songwriter, able to switch between moods effortlessly yet providing a fresh, contemporary feel to all of his work. It was also nice to see the supportive mentality of Speckulation’s approach to new musical theatre continuing through Bruce himself as he provided a showcase opportunity for 3 final year students, one each from Sam Edwards from ArtsEd, Emily Scott-Dobie from Mountview and Amelia Adams-Pearce from the Royal Academy of Music, to join this illustrious company and sing one of his songs. All three acquitted themselves well, Scott-Dobie delivered her comedy number well, Edwards had a beautiful tone to his voice and Adams-Pearce gave a stunning rendition of ‘It’s Not Gonna Rain’: whatever the future holds for them, they will surely remember this opportunity given to them and they can hold their heads high. We were finally treated to what was teased as a moment of musical theatre history, although more accurately a moment of Speckulation history with a full 5 and a half minute promo video for Portrait of a Princess, featuring Julie Atherton skipping through locations like Ridley Road Market and Clissold Park with an all-star supporting cast around her. It takes what is already a funny song and just lifts it up to another level with some hilarious cameos from the likes of Sheridan Smith, Tom Parsons, some adorable kids and if that’s not enough, there’s the sight of Steven Webb with a condom on his face and Russell Tovey cruising a buff Jon Lee in the park, what more could you want! You can see the video below or at http://www.portraitofaprincess.com/ now and it is well worth a watch – there are also links there to buy the album in different formats.   "

1358,1358,Ought To Be Clowns,29/06/2014,mag9l,Adler & Gibb, Royal Court,"And so once again, theatres lead where critics are not inclined to follow… After the divisiveness of the extraordinary Mr Burns at the Almeida, the Royal Court now turns its hand to something a little different in the form of Tim Crouch’s Adler & Gibb. A(nother) distinctly lukewarm reception from the print critics is hardly surprising but it does feel a shame that there isn’t more of a groundswell of support for the diversity of programming we’re so lucky to have here in London. In a West End where Coward revivals are two a penny and there are actually two Importance of Being Earnests queued up to go into theatres, I for one am grateful that these opportunities are being presented to me.  A New Jersey art student Louise gives a presentation about Janet Adler, a conceptual artist who retreated from the world with her partner Margaret Gibb and died a mysterious death. Onstage, an older woman is researching and rehearsing a role for a biopic film with a colleague before a location shoot. Around them, two children in headphones are stage-managing the show, incrementally increasing our understanding about just what it is that we’re watching. The critical response has proved most illuminating about the way theatre that defies convention (for want of a better term) is received here – Shenton tweeted semi-obliquely and then harrumphed about his bafflement; Cavendish castigated Royal Court AD Vicky Featherstone for not responding to the crises in Iraq and Ukraine (both of which started earlier this year, whilst this play was announced in November 2013 and was presumably programmed well before then…), Billington havered on the same 3 star rating that he gave Mr Burns but at least he engaged somewhat with what Crouch is trying to do rather than just expressing personal displeasure. We’re witness to the live construction of character and story that is highly imaginatively done. Louise’s presentation is interspersed with a slideshow which is in fact the preparation for a film about Adler, snippets of information from the student suddenly make sense as the strands feed into each other, slowly coalescing into a grand whole as we discover who the actress is and just how far she is willing to go in order to truly become Adler, become her character.  It’s not to say that this show (or any other for that matter) is automatically good because it is different – another show that might fall into the same bracket is the Lyric’s Show #5 which left me utterly cold – but rather that it might require something of a different mindset to really interrogate it critically. Pointing out that it lacks a clear structure or that we’re confused in the first half may describe the obvious but clearly ignores authorial intent. The form of the theatrical structure he builds for us takes time to take shape and is an ongoing process, evolving even further beyond theatre as it tests a uniquely twenty-first century perception of the blurring of the boundaries between art and reality. Undoubtedly it could be considered a challenge to watch – the dripfeed of info may frustrate, its playful approach to staging may flummox but it might just exhilarate as well. Adler & Gibb has so much to say about the nature of contemporary art and the way in which we both demand and shape it, hungry for every detail about the artist just as much as (and possibly even more than) the art itself. And as with any piece of conceptual art, one has to work for a meaning that makes sense for oneself."
1359,1359,Ought To Be Clowns,20/08/2015,mag9l,Sweet Charity in concert, Cadogan Hall,"It’s been five years since the Menier’s glorious revival of Sweet Charity so London has been waiting a wee while for the misadventures of Charity Hope Valentine to return to our stages but with this semi-staged concert version at Cadogan Hall, it’s been largely worth the wait. A cast led by Denise Van Outen, the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, and an ensemble of bright young things from ArtsEd Ensemble combine to joyous effect and with barely a week’s rehearsal, it’s all the more impressive for that. Van Outen makes a great Charity, infusing a wonderfully wry sense of humour into her demeanour which cleverly reinforces her indefatigable spirit. Supremely confident vocals and a smooth move or two in Matt Flint’s choreography make her a constant joy to watch and one could well imagine her nailing the role in a full-blown production too, especially if she were joined by Michael Xavier as the various men she encounters. Never mind the frozen peaches and cream, HE’S the stuff of dreams whether the appealing nerdishness of Oscar or the hapless lothario that is Vittorio, his lusciously rich voice undoubtedly one of the best in British musical theatre. I was impressed too by Kimberley Walsh (the connoisseur’s favourite Girls Alouder) and Kerry Ellis as Charity’s pals Nickie and Helene, despite memories of the divine Josefina Gabrielle and Tiffany Graves in Southwark. Ellis’ sardonic wit and Walsh’s warmer honesty matched up perfectly, especially in ‘Baby, Dream Your Dream’ and supported by the girls of the ensemble, showed us plenty of fun and laughs as well as a cracking good time in ‘Hey, Big Spender’. Rodney Earl Clarke’s Daddy Brubeck also deserves a special mention for putting a tingle in our collective extremities in ‘The Rhythm of Life’."
1360,1360,Ought To Be Clowns,10/10/2010,Ian,Faust, English National Opera at the Coliseum,"In a rather odd coincidence, my visit to the ENO’s production of Gounod’s Faust came just a couple of days after my slightly unwilling trip to Jersey Boys and unlikely as it may seem, these two shows actually share a director in Des McAnuff. You can currently see the Faust story being rocked Reykjavik-style at the Young Vic but this interpretation of the classic tale focuses on Faust’s obsession with Marguerite but has been relocated to a nuclear research laboratory in 1945 with the scientist suffering from post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki guilt and dreaming of an earlier time, and a girl, which for him is in the time of the First World War. In the lead roles, none of Iain Paterson, Toby Spence and Melody Moore disappointed as they were all vocally strong (apart from Paterson’s lower notes) but I found it hard to really engage with them as characters. Paterson’s Mephistopheles was nicely avuncular rather than devilish; Spence’ Faust was handsome but largely wooden and Moore’s Marguerite was unconvincing at playing the lighter notes of a girl distracted by jewels or swept off her feet, only really connecting in the final scene. I actually enjoyed the supporting performances more: Anna Grevelius made for a bright voiced Siebel and there was also excellent work from Benedict Nelson as Marguerite’s brother Valentin and Pamela Helen Stephen as one of her friends Marthe. I generally found the larger sound to be quite muggy, whether it was the lack of clear diction from the chorus or a fuzziness from Edward Gardner’s orchestra, everything felt as if refracted through a lens and in need of more clarity. For me, too many aspects of the design did not work. There was a lot of clumsy staging, the waltz was rather boring and a wasted opportunity, the return of the soldiers from WWI was dominated by the need to squeeze in one by one through a ridiculously narrow doorway, Hell wasn’t anywhere near hellish enough, the use of projections was ill-thought-through (and simply creepy in the case of the giant blinking faces). And as anyone who has read a few of my reviews will know, I hated the use of puppets, especially as it was purely cosmetic here, they did nothing but come onstage briefly and then disappear. Peter Mumford’s lighting is highly effective though and there were some great moments, most of which involved staircases."
1361,1361,Ought To Be Clowns,20/07/2010,Ian,Light Shining In Buckinghamshire, Arcola,"Light Shining in Buckinghamshire is one of Caryl Churchill’s earlier plays, taking up residence now in Studio 1 of Dalston’s Arcola Theatre. Set during the English Civil War, it deals with a period of time when there was huge political upheaval, the conflict between the power of the landowning class and the burgeoning ideals around individual freedom came to a head and questions around liberty and real democracy were posed by the different factions in Cromwell’s New Model Army. The focus in each half is around a debate, in the first half it is the Putney Debates of 1647 when common soldiers argued passionately for genuine democratic reform in opposition to Oliver Cromwell’s policies of protecting the power of the landowners. In the second, it is a group of common people who have found God through or indeed despite their suffering and starvation. Around these focal points is a collage of stories of how brutal life for the population at large is, as they are constantly kept down-at-heel: the poor are whipped, children abandoned to their death, evangelists preaching of the new heaven on earth for men but not women, all rather bleak. Structurally, the play is quite challenging, with lots of fragmented short scenes, a bewildering array of characters and to be honest, requires at least a rudimentary knowledge of the Civil War to fully appreciate what is going on. But even with that, the fundamental truths that Churchill seeks to highlight shine through regardless: the pain and agonies of the dispossessed and disenchanted, repressed by those seeking to protect their entitled positions in society. The new regime promised change but ultimately very little has changed. The actors all do extremely well at switching between their various roles at lightning speed but maintaining an honest integrity throughout. The ensemble is impressively tight already: Michelle Terry is astounding as the General Ireton at the aforementioned Putney debate and her face-off with Helena Lymbrey’s impassioned soldier is the highlight of the show; Kobna Holdbrook-Smith (so very recently in Joe Turner’s Come and Gone) scarily intense butcher, Jamie Ballard’s preaching, Christopher Harper’s praying and Philip Arditti’s schmoozing also impressed. The set is bleakly atmospheric in Hannah Clark’s austere design, a ditch in the form of a cross has been dug down to reveal the soil beneath, emphasising the importance of the land to everyone, the occasional chanting of psalms reminding us of the religious fervour. A bare minimum of props, a soldier’s helmet here, a bottle of London Pride beer there, focus the attention well; the costumes which vary from 17th century dress to modern-day conflict-wear evoke the swirling timelessness well, without pushing the contemporary comparisons too much."

1365,1365,Ought To Be Clowns,08/03/2011,Ian,Aida, Royal Opera House,"This was my first time seeing Aida, a story both epic, in the war between the Ethiopians and the Egyptians, and intimate, in the tragic love triangle that emerges between Ethiopian slave Aida, Amneris the daughter of the King of Egypt and the man they both love, Radames the Captain of the Guard. And the first half is nothing short of epic, full of huge set pieces with innumerable personnel onstage as whether it is priests making dramatic human sacrifices and blood-letting or vast armies arriving onstage. The production incorporates a range of Eastern influences into the mix, but the samurai martial arts work was probably the most visually impressive. Though the spectacle of the first half was truly stunning, it was the second half that really captured my attention with an unexpectedly intimate examination of the love triangle at the heart of the story. Roberto Alagna and Micaela Carosi shone as the doomed Radames and Aida, but it was the frustrated Amneris who really caught my heart with Olga Borodina’s powerful yet ultimately frustrated princess having to admit defeat. The scene where Radames was on trial was superbly played with the audience eavesdropping on proceedings from outside along with Amneris and it was heartbreaking to watch. So a great trip, supplemented by a little backstage tour, chats with stage managers and Associate Directors who kindly gave up their valuable time to answer all sorts of random questions and give extra insight into the workings of putting an opera together and the changes that are made when reviving a production. I was particularly surprised at the late notice with which Alagna had been attached to the role, something which was thrown into even greater relief the next day when it was announced that Carosi was withdrawing due to pregnancy and Liudmyla Monastyrska was stepping in at the last minute, showing just how well-oiled a machine this is."
1366,1366,Ought To Be Clowns,29/02/2012,Ian,Floyd Collins, Southwark Playhouse,"I don’t normally read much about shows before I go in especially if they are new to me, as I do like that element of surprise and novelty that is increasingly rare. But had I read that Floyd Collins, just opened at the Southwark Playhouse, was a musical containing a song that Stephen Sondheim wished he had wrote and is routinely described as complex, demanding and jagged, I might have been a little better prepared for it. Tina Landau (book and additional lyrics) and Adam Guettel’s (music and lyrics) musical really is a daring piece of work which challenges and provokes, though in this case ultimately frustrates. Using the depths of the converted Vault space and a lot of ladders, James Perkins’ design seems ideally suited to recreating 1925 Kentucky and its system of inter-connected caves which our eponymous leading man is famed for exploring. But as he searches for more fame and fortune in new caves, he gets trapped by a rockfall 55 feet under the ground but it is the efforts to try and release him end up and the huge media circus that forms around it that makes up much of the show, exposing the effects on Floyd, his family and those trying to rescue him. Things started off brightly with ‘The Ballad of Floyd Collins’ (which reminded me if anything of the Ugly Kid Joe song ‘Cats In The Cradle’) which wears its folky Americana influences with a tuneful grace, but as the score progresses it becomes increasingly demanding as it takes unexpected dissonant turns into territory that is more akin to the discordant work of classical composers like Stravinsky and Janáček. Such complexity has won acclaim from the high end – at least one critic has sniffily declared it ‘out of the reach of most people’ – but it is rarely an easy listen, as vocal lines twist and jar and yodel to disconcerting effect, where I’d’ve loved a straighter bluegrass-infused score if I’m honest. Such an approach would be more acceptable if the book had been stronger, but Landau struggles to make us care about the plight of Collins, who for the most part is stuck under a barely accessible ladder/rock and frequently just left there while the show continues around him (former Jesus and Jersey Boy Glenn Carter even remains there during the interval), and so the focus is thrust onto the supporting characters who haven’t all been fleshed out enough to stand this attention. The recently de-institutionalised Nellie his sister floats around like a spare part, his brother Homer recollects the past and dreams of the future but is given precious little depth, his parents are barely ciphers. The saving grace comes with the character of Skeets, the slight reporter who can squeeze through to see Floyd and thus get his story out to the wider world. Played by Ryan Sampson (so very excellent in The Kitchen Sink last year), there’s a real sense of the man who has been utterly changed by events as his journalistic subject becomes someone he cares for and gets really involved with as the prospects for rescue fade away. Sampson sings well but has such an open expressiveness that it is his acting which is the most compelling. But one song and one character cannot make you like a show. As the show failed to engage me, my attention turned to the little details – the constantly shifting tone, the variable Kentucky accents, the lack of lyrical clarity, the flatness of the narrative which fails to build to any sort of climax. So not one for me, though the challenges of Floyd Collins are clearly appreciated elsewhere. This show is probably one of the more memorable ones you will see this year.  Its entertaining and very original and its got the gorgeous voice of Glenn Carter in it as the central character and a very strong supporting cast.Tickets are inexpensive.Go and see it.

1367,1367,Ought To Be Clowns,22/12/2015,mag9l,The National Theatre Theatre Quiz 2015,,"My first ever trip to the institution that is the National Theatre Christmas Quiz saw teams of four from current shows Husbands and Sons and wonder.land doing battle for the honour of, well, several bottles of fizz as it turned out. With Emma Freud as Quizmistress and Angus Deayton keeping the scores, it was a light-hearted 45 minutes of festive fun. Rounds varied from odd-one-out, working out song lyrics from a dry line reading by Deayton, guess which NT show the costume was from, to Taboo-style-guessing-games, and a surprising array of knowledge troves and hidden talents soon came to life – Anne-Marie Duff was very up on her theatrical knowledge, Julia Ford is clearly itching to do a musical and Anna Francolini bossed everything (apart from Katie Mitchell…)."
1368,1368,Ought To Be Clowns,29/03/2005,Ian,His Dark Materials Part II, National Theatre,"This part is where some of the more obvious changes to the original books are more evident. Much of the third book has been excised, the character of Mary Malone not used here and the amber spyglass becomes less important as a result. But the story still works nonetheless, and the trip to the Land of the Dead has to rank as one of the most beautifully realised pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen, haunting and incredibly moving. Likewise, the ending to the whole story was devastatingly done, leaving me crying for a good 10 minutes after we had left the theatre even though I knew what was coming."
1369,1369,Ought To Be Clowns,25/01/2016,mag9l,Yen, Royal Court,"Anna Jordan’s Yen follows its fellow 2013 Bruntwood Prize-winner The Rolling Stone by Chris Urch in transferring from Manchester to London and given that In-Sook Chappell’s P’yongyang was on the shortlist for the same year and is selling out the Finborough now, it’s all rather a good showcase for this particular cohort of that playwriting competition. The play is a taut, terrifying version of corrupted teenagerhood, not a million miles away from the world of Simon Stephens’ Herons, just set on the other side of London in a council flat in Feltham. There, brothers 16-year-old Hench and 13-year-old Bobby have been left alone by their mother and become cut off from the world around them with no family, friends or school to distract them from a relentless diet of porn and computer games and just a single t-shirt to share. But bleak as it may seem in the very rough and tumble of their horseplay and banter, there’s tenderness too. When their alcoholic mother turns up, they know just what to do to pull her out of a diabetic coma with the leftover Luzocade kept for this very purpose, and it is this quality that unexpected visitor Jennifer espies in the pair when she turns up on their doorstep, concerned about the dog (unseen, but named Taliban) they keep locked up in their bedroom. And so what at first seemed hopeless suddenly becomes hopeful, and this is where Yen really sings. Jordan’s ability to encapsulate the modern world so neatly, where the nuclear family has been so thoroughly exploded and domestic bliss comes in the arrangements we find for our ourselves, is beautifully realised. Naturally, this sits right besides the ugliness of the real world and Jordan does not shy away from showing us the difficulties the boys have in engaging therein. In the shape-shifting terrain of Ned Bennett’s production, Alex Austin’s Hench is just fantastic, his putative romance with Jennifer a gorgeous experiment in socialisation but his untamed side never too far away, as the poor heater (or is it more…) finds out. Jake Davies’ younger Bobbie is rawer, more damaged as the play’s key moment (unseen) reveals, his eager energy spilling all over the stage. Annes Elwy’s Jennifer is also impressively played, sidestepping any potential tweeness with real warmth."
1370,1370,Ought To Be Clowns,11/03/2020,Ian,Austentatious, Fortune Theatre,"It’s been a moment since I’ve seen Austentatious. Their rise has been sure and steady over the last few years, graduating from monthly residencies at the Leicester Square Theatre to the Savoy Theatre and then on to a weekly booking at the Fortune Theatre, whilst also finding time for highly successful national tours and seasons at the Edinburgh Fringe. And that’s also not to mention that this is a side hustle for this company of very-much-in-demand comedians. I’ve seen them just a few times over the years but weekly visits at West End prices are beyond even my devotion (that said, there is a loyalty card scheme…). But I couldn’t resist a visit to welcome them back to the bijou surroundings of the Fortune where we were treated to the surreal delights of Northanger Crabby. For the uninitiated, Austentatious is a show entirely improvised in Jane Austen-style and costume from a title suggested by the audience.  And as ever, it was hilarious, so very funny in ways it is impossible to explain. Seeing the whole company crack up at the terrifying concept of a mouth baby, running with ideas about what Pinocchio might sound like, being awfully keen to rub away crotch stains from a weeping orange… As you might guess, the comedy is far from restrained to the Regency era but it was interesting to see elements of Gothic horror perhaps more akin to the Brontës creeping in here – I don’t think I’ve seen them flirt with such darkness before (Daniel Nils Robert to play Heathcliff soon though, *swoon*)."

1372,1372,Ought To Be Clowns,15/03/2018,Ian,Things That Do Not C(o)unt, VAULT Festival,"I was a big fan of No Offence Theatre’s torn apart (dissolution) so the opportunity to catch their new show Things That Do Not C(o)unt in the final week of the VAULT Festival was one I was keen not to pass up. Written and performed by Nastazja Somers and co-created with Bj McNeill, it probes away at some of the key recurring themes that emerged in this festival. Society’s expectations of women, and its expectations of how young women should deal with their nascent sexuality. Body image and the uneasy relationship that it inculcates with food. But there’s also a deeply personal vein to this show as well. Partly autobiographical in nature, Somers presents and investigates her Polish heritage too, exploring that impact too."
1373,1373,Ought To Be Clowns,29/09/2014,Ian,Next Fall, Southwark Playhouse,"Like the warmth of a hug you didn’t know you needed, the tender beauty of Geoffrey Nauffts’ Next Fall creeps up on you gradually as an initially comic tone melts into something infinitely more moving. Though the play hooks on a dramatically convenient device to bring together a group of people, the way that it explores the various intersecting relationships between them all is a masterpiece of quietly compelling emotion and perfectly honed construction – one can well see why it was a much-nominated success during its 2010 Broadway run. Adam and Luke have been together for several years now, navigating the twists and turns of their relationship like old pros, like Adam’s insecurities as he’s just that little bit older than Luke and Luke’s refusal to come out to his family back in Florida even though he’s out and proud in their pokey New York apartment. At the heart of that decision though is something more fundamentally serious – Luke’s devoutly Christian beliefs which fly right in the face of Adam’s atheism, an issue which is interrogated sensitively but deeply as Nauffts asks us what it really means to have faith as we flashback to key points in their time together. Charlie Condou’s Adam and Martin Delaney’s Luke make for a great couple, their differences complementary and their chemistry utterly believable – director Luke Sheppard ensures there’s an ease to their physical intimacy that means we never doubt in their relationship and manages to eschew the predilection of so many a gay play of having its characters wander around shirtless all the time (one scene in their boxers notwithstanding ;-)) And there’s something pleasingly complex about the tangle they find themselves in whenever they talk about religion. Though the British inclination might be to side with Adam in mocking anyone who believes the Rapture is coming, his unquestioning dismissal of Christianity is far from automatically sympathetic. And Luke’s rationalising of his beliefs in the modern world speak of an untested naïveté, especially when talking about forgiveness for Matthew Shepard’s killers. On top of all of this, Nauffts throws in a tragic accident which brings in other people from their lives and further tests Adam’s resolve as he’s forced onto the sidelines. The pill-popping but well-intentioned largesse of Nancy Crane’s Arlene and the overcompensating butchness of Mitchell Mullen’s Butch go some way to explaining Luke’s reticence in coming out to his divorced parents but staring into the abyss and with Adam refusing to back away, they find out the hard way that acceptance and change is the only way forward. So too with Sirine Saba’s beautifully warm fag hag and Ben Cura’s black-man-loving closet case, the understated emotional impact of their friend’s accident serving as a much-needed tipping point for the stasis in their lives."
1374,1374,Ought To Be Clowns,08/07/2017,Ian,torn apart (dissolution), Hope,"They fuck you up, your mum and dad. Or do they? Among the many themes raised by Bj McNeill’s is nature versus nurture, questioning if there’s an inescapable genetic legacy carried down by parents whether they’re a part of one’s life or not, looking at what impact their presence – or otherwise – has on one’s own emotional development. Are we doomed to repeat their mistakes or are we actually just responsible for our own fuck ups. torn apart (dissolution) approaches this with a triptych of relationships in stark relief. A Polish student and an American soldier connect in 1980s West Germany; an Australian backpacker parties hard like it is 1999, realising that her boyfriend has fallen even harder despite her visa expiry date fast approaching; and also in London, in the present day, Holly’s love for Erica is challenged by long-reaching shadows from both of their pasts.  In the confines of Szymon Ruszczewski’s cage-like design, these three love stories play out exclusively in bedrooms, a space to get figuratively – and in some cases, literally – naked. A place for the intensity of burning passion, the privacy of deepest-held feelings, the sanctuary where it feels safe to reveal earth-shattering news. It’s a clever piece of design too – at first sight a device that traps our couples together, on closer examination you see the ‘bars’ are made of string, the actors periodically playing with them, even breaching them sometimes, suggesting that they are only really as trapped as they want to be. And as these parallel narratives subtly wind ever closer, the beauty in McNeill’s characterisations comes in all their rough edges, hinting at an inherent truth that we’re all too easily inclined towards selfishness, even in the name of doing something good. We feel this strongest in the contemporary strand – Sarah Hastings’ Holly getting it all wrong in response to a crisis for Monty Leigh’s Erica, their potent but troubled connection finding increasing echoes in Nastazja Somers and Charlie Allen’s culture clash in the 80s."
1375,1375,Ought To Be Clowns,16/05/2013,Ian,Merrily We Roll Along, Harold Pinter,"Menier Chocolate Factory Christmas musicals have a habit of making the leap into the West End and given the rapturous reception that Sondheim’s Merrily We Roll Along received last year, it was no surprise to hear that it would make the well-deserved transfer into the Harold Pinter Theatre for a 12 week engagement. My original review of the show can be read here and perhaps not unexpectedly, very little has changed of my feelings about this rather magnificent production. But more surprising was how little I felt it had changed in the considerably larger space of this new theatre.  It’s a good six months since I saw it so perhaps my memory isn’t too reliable but it really does feel very similar indeed, Soutra Gilmour’s design slots into the theatre in a similar fashion and the staging – although expanded to fill the space – moves around it in the same way. Not that this is a bad thing, but rather that I’m not exactly sure about how it might play from further back or up in the theatre than you’d ever be in the Menier. Where the lack of discernible difference is a definite boon though is in the performance level. First-time director Maria Friedman really has worked wonders with her high-quality cast, ensuring a depth of emotional understanding that underpins the customary strength of their vocals and creates much more rounded characters from Sondheim’s sometimes-forensic approach to people. So Mark Umbers‘ brash Franklin Shepard garners, if not quite sympathy, a measure of compassion due to the well-meaning but suffocating pressure inflicted by his loved ones – his face as Clare Foster’s first wife Beth tears into Not A Day Goes By is a masterpiece in reactive acting – the reverse chronology allowing us to see just how much of his rebellious streak comes from these expectations."
1376,1376,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2020,Ian,Something Awful, VAULT Festival,"The Cavern is one of the more unforgiving spaces at the VAULT Festival and so directors need to take real care to ensure their pieces work in this long, dank hall. As a horror story, Something Awful has the additional pressure of cultivating an effectively eerie atmosphere in here and to be honest, it’s a bit too much of a challenge. Tatty Hennessy’s play uses the 2014 Slenderman stabbing case  – where two  12 year old girls stabbed their mutual friend in the name of the internet-created myth of the Slenderman – as its inspiration to explore a very similar incident. Along the way, it touches on the anxieties and complexities of teenage relationships, how friendship and bullying can co-exist, and the role the internet can play in shaping so much of this. In this, Something Awful is most successful. The interplay between friends Soph and Jel and newcomer Ellie is compellingly drawn, as Ellie tells big and bold stories to establish her bad girl rep and they find their common ground in an online forum that shares urban horror stories. Hennessy skilfully shows us the ease with which they can break through parent-installed cyber security but also never lets us forget how young these girls are, no matter how grown-up they consider themselves."
1377,1377,Ought To Be Clowns,26/05/2019,Ian,Amélie the Musical, New Wimbledon Theatre,"As sweet-sharp as a diabolo grenadine, Amélie the Musical has lost none of its inimitable charm as it gears up for a considerable UK tour. I adored it at the Watermill but the intimacy there left me wondering how the show would fare in the significantly larger houses to which it will be touring. Turns out I need not have worried. Michael Fentiman’s production has expanded perfectly to fill the space. A few more ensemble members here, a tweak to Madeleine Girling’s canny set design there, and the show has lost nothing of itself or its kooky Parisian whirl. If anything the actor-muso ensemble’s reinterpretation of Daniel Messé’s score sounds even better than before under George Francis’ musical direction. Audrey Brisson’s Amélie remains a real gift. Determined to be “a mystery wrapped in an enigma trapped in a paradox disappearing into thin air”, she’s nonetheless evidence of the ripple effect of even the smallest act of kindness. And it feels important that no easy answers are presented to the social anxiety that plagues her – the prospect of future happiness with Nino (Danny Mac stepping into the role) is by no means a certain thing, but the silence with which these two finally make it IRL is one of the most deeply romantic things I’ve seen on stage all year."
1378,1378,Ought To Be Clowns,11/07/2017,Ian,The Scar Test, Soho Theatre,"Hannah Khalil’s intelligent exploration of the Israeli-Palestine conflict Scenes from 68* Years was one of my top-ranked plays of last year and so I was delighted to be able to see her new play The Scar Test, albeit in the oppressive, claustrophobic heat of the Soho Upstairs at the height of summer. And with that knowledge of at least some of Khalil’s theatrical style, it was a pleasure to be able to sink into her idiosyncratic storytelling and be so thoroughly challenged by its subject matter. Here, Khalil has turned her focus to the experience of female detainees at the notorious Yarl’s Wood detention centre and the many, many indignities suffered by those trying to work their way through the knots and prejudices of our immigration system. And as with that previous play, multiple verbatim strands are splintered into non-linear episodes, some coalescing into something approaching an overall arc, some disappearing into the ether, forgotten victims neglected by us all. Sara Joyce’s direction responds beautifully to the style, introducing emotive movement work from Sinead O’Keeffe which deepens in significance as it recurs throughout, the revelation of the jumpers also serving as an adroit way of exploiting these women’s bodies any further. For the grim realities of life for those who end up here, the abuses they’re running from sadly matched by the different kind of abuses suffered in the name of security, means we’re frequently left shaken by how far it goes. The horrors that could leave a person mute (an absolutely superb Rebecca Omogbehin), the deportation to a country she’s never been to threatened to the British-born child of illegal immigrants, the desperation of the over-worked lawyers fighting for their causes, the dispassionate way with which the security guards carry out their business. Having the ensemble rotate through any number of these roles keeps a meaningful balance through the stark feelings of the play but the sombre nature of Zoe Spurr’s lighting maintains the deadly serious air. "
1379,1379,Ought To Be Clowns,30/05/2018,Ian,The Rink, Southwark Playhouse,"All sorts of thoughts pass through your mind as you watch The Rink, at least they do if you’re me. Wouldn’t Gemma Sutton be perfect casting in the lead of the inevitable Lindsay Lohan: The Musical; does Jason Winter have the longest legs in musical theatre; does Caroline O’Connor have any trace of a Lancashire accent at all; didn’t Kander and Ebb write fricking fantastic songs for women; and does an ability to roller-skate in a musical make you a quadruple threat? That’s not to say I was distracted whilst sweltering in the Southwark Playhouse during this preview on Saturday, but rather that my mind was entirely stimulated (not least when Winter does some kind of windmill move on the floor…😃). The Rink is one of those musicals that history hasn’t treated too kindly, despite a premiere that starred Chita Rivera and Liza Minnelli but with Adam Lenson’s expert hand at the tiller, this is a revival to treasure.  The show concerns a dilapidated Coney Island roller-rink that long-suffering Anna has decided to sell up and move on out of. Her plans are scuppered, temporarily at least, when her estranged daughter (and co-owner) Angel appears and a lifetime of recriminations and regrets are hashed out, each coming to realise that their memories don’t quite recall things the same way. Swirling through past and present, it’s thus quite a journey. Caroline O’Connor and Gemma Sutton are inspired casting choices as the feisty Italian-American pair: O’Connor brilliantly, scathingly quick-witted as the bittersweetly hilarious Anna, and Sutton’s devilish glint showing how the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, despite more than 10 years absence from the family home. And as the men set to knock down the rink, and any number of incidental male characters in the story, there’s great ensemble work from Stewart Clarke, Ross Dawes, Michael Lin, Elander Moore, Ben Redfern and Jason Winter.  Fabian Aloise’s choreography is as good at hinting what’s going to happen before a single roller-boot has been laced up as it is when the company are wheeling around and (mostly) seeming to be having the time of their life. And Kander and Ebb’s score is full of big, brassy moments and gorgeous sostenuto notes that MD Joe Bunker marshals with real skill. It’s vibrant and heartfelt and huge amounts of fun."
1380,1380,Ought To Be Clowns,30/07/2015,mag9l,Bakkhai, Almeida,"What is most fascinating about the way that the Almeida Greeks season is unfolding is that it is as interested in interrogating storytelling as much as stories. As with Aeschylus’ Oresteia and now Euripides’ Bakkhai, we’re being presented with striking new versions of these familiar tales which simultaneously make a case for why they have endured into a third millennium rather than complacently assuming they will just speak to modern audiences regardless. Robert Icke incisively opened up the domestic and legal ramifications of the House of Atreus in forensic detail. And now Anne Carson, following her version of Antigone for Ivo van Hove, and director James Macdonald position their Bakkhai deep in the recesses of folk memory, a guttural song passed from generation to generation with its cautionary tale of the consequences of leading society to defy convention. It is sure to be divisive but I have to say that I found it endlessly interesting. Macdonald has adopted an ancient Greek performance style so that three actors share all the roles of the play supported by a fully vocal and integrated Chorus. Thus our expectations are toyed with and challenged – Ben Whishaw’s presence is as company member rather than outright star of the show and the full-bodied presence of the 10-strong Chorus in all their primal musicality and densely poetic fervour amplifies their significance to the telling of this story, their interjections dictating its flow. Whishaw is indeed powerful as the vengeful god in both his manipulative human form and the god himself, lit superbly by Peter Mumford with his flickering hints of the divine but he’s equally touching as Teiresias or a servant recounting various horrors. For Dionysos is wreaking his revenge on a Thebes that has turned its back on him at the instigation of Pentheus, a wonderfully autocratic Bertie Carvel, who later gives an impassioned performance as his woe-begotten mother Agave, a stunning transformation. And completely this trifecta is Kevin Harvey, no lesser known third wheel but an equally important part of the puzzle, especially as Pentheus’ grandfather Kadmos, wise but helpless and doomed to a world of anguish. Around them swirl the women of the Chorus, the Bakkhai themselves, delivering choral odes in Orlando Gough’s tangled and complex score in all its fierce and urgent power that very much beats to the sound of its own drum (or Melanie La Barrie’s beatboxing!). The West End is full of famous faces doing predictable things with predictable dramas so it is pleasing to see other theatres and their companies contrasting that. Bakkhai is at times difficult, angular, strange but it is also playful (the Bakkhai’s continual physical evolution), sexy (Dionysos and Pentheus make sparks fly), heartfelt (Kadmos and Agave ‘s articulation of their pain is exquisite). Recommended.   "
1381,1381,Ought To Be Clowns,24/07/2013,Ian,Wag! The Musical, Charing Cross,"I doubt anyone is turning up to WAG! The Musical expecting insightful commentary into the illusory nature of celebrity and the socio-economic impact of the WAG phenomenon on a generation of young women. But it is hard to see exactly what Tibetan writer Belvedere Pashun is trying to achieve or say. This is no indictment of the WAG lifestyle – with personal spray tan artists and eyelash suppliers credited in the programme, how could it be – and it seems like it wants to break away from the stereotypical image of these figures to show the real women within. But it is hard to feel any vestige of sympathy or indeed empathy for any of them when everything they do pertains to received notions of WAGdom. The tottering around in sky-high heels, the money-grabbing chase after rich men, the turning up to any event which has the label ‘celebrity’ plastered on it, sleeping with other women’s husbands, acting like a grade-A bitch when you’ve been caught sleeping other women’s husbands and still somehow getting away with it. There’s no real attempt to show that there could be anything more to a WAG than these situations and so the stereotypes end up being reinforced. Matters aren’t helped by an odd approach to casting which prioritises real-life WAG experience over genuine stage chops. Lizzie Cundy have interviewed a thousand celebrities and spoken to Andrew Lloyd Webber about whether to take a part in this show, but none of that stops her from being uncomfortably wooden onstage and missing any kind of comic timing. Pippa Fulton as the bitchiest WAG Vicci hails from a stagier background but also trades on her real-life status and both these women completely overdo hand movements whilst singing, overcompensating for the lack of genuine emotion. The arrival of Ariadne the Greek WAG further baffles things. The creation of comedian Alyssa Kyria, Ariadne’s patter is straight-up stand up as she rattles through a series of (mainly Greek) bawdy jokes – it’s not that she’s not funny but it feels very much as if she has wandered in from another show, her material barely integrated with the book. And elsewhere the lack of experience shows: as the lead character of sorts, Daisy Wood-Davis’ Jenny has a pleasant sounding voice but her compatriot, Amy Scott’s Sharron, fails to really register on the stage, likewise the ensemble need to sharpen up and strengthen vocal and dance lines. Certain of Alison Pollard’s directorial choices don’t help either. Opening the show with an ensemble-led number leaves them extremely exposed for something for which they’re not quite ready; choreography appears in the randomest of places, the number in the basement is basically inexplicable; and there’s a cringeworthy, saccharine group moment with the song Always Tomorrow which feels like the cheesiest of endings, only to be followed by yet more scenes, in this case showing Paris off in a most sophisticated way… The score by Grant Martin, Thomas Giron-Towers and Tony Bayliss is perfectly passable, inoffensive rather than inspired, though one wonders what a stronger vocal company would have made of it. There are hints of that with two of the subsidiary female characters: Katie Kerr’s lewd Blow-Jo (yes, it’s her name) and Nia Jermin’s Charmaine have excellent voices and a surer comic touch which makes their numbers really stand out, it’s just a shame they’re both quite limited in the show."
1382,1382,Ought To Be Clowns,19/06/2016,mag9l,The Donkey Show, Proud Camden,"So we hit my sixth different production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 2016 with The Donkey Show – A Midsummer Night’s Disco which is less Shakespeare than Shalamar, more Baccara than the Bard. Setting up shop for the summer in nightspot Proud Camden, Athens is thus swapped out for the more hedonistic locale of Club Oberon, where trapeze artists swing from the ceiling, fire breathers roam the stage and pole-dancing go-go boys take the place of fairies. First created by Randy Weiner and Diane Paulus in 1999, the immersive nature of the production – audience members are encouraged to dance throughout, climbing on podiums optional, – proved a hit formula as disco classics replace iambic pentameter and aerial hoop work is substituted for characterisation. The reimagined and much-reduced story sees merry wanderers of the night Mia, Dmitri, Helen and Sander at the mercy of club hostess Lady Puck, a drag artiste on rollerskates, pushing pills left right and centre at the bidding of nefarious owner Oberon. This aspect works relatively well. James Gillan is a suitably glittery knavish sprite who revels in ruling the roost and an adroit choice of songs suits the lovers’ travails well – Bronté Barbé’s Helen begs ‘Don’t Leave Me This Way’ to Dmitri, a drugged-up Sander (Melissa Bayern) croons ‘I Believe In Miracles’ to his new love, a wasted Mia (a very good Vikki Stone) laments ‘If I Can’t Have You’ once she sees her love’s attention deflected elsewhere.  But the puzzling choice to include Nick Bottom alone of the other characters, in the form of twin guys both called Vinnie, along with the transformation into a donkey (which is…a drug-induced hallucination, I think?) falls flat, their presence is mainly confusing and there’s just no investment with them or indeed with Tytania who is unforgivably reduced to a showgirl. And in a post-Punchdrunk world, the stakes of immersive theatre have now been raised, exposing the lack of dramatic sophistication here – nothing theatrically new bursts from this treatment. And for me, and maybe I’m just getting old and grumpy (or should that be grumpier), the blurring of the lines of theatre and entertainment here was problematic. Are you an audience member or a clubber? Is it ok to just stand chatting to your pals, taking selfies, rather than watching and listening? Ryan McBryde’s production offers no clear answer and so your experience here could well be variable as was mine.  At the point where I was being elbowed out of the way yet again for someone to breathlessly take another picture of a shirtless acrobat and then the final indignity of someone spilling their drink all down my leg and laughing, I was less with The Nolans than The Scissor Sisters. Which is a shame, as the company are hugely impressive in their unflagging enthusiasm to keep the energy high, from the security on stilts to the guy tirelessly wiping the floor of those spilled drinks, everyone’s singing along and encouraging you to boogie (for me, Samuel Fogell and Nyron Levy were the best on the floor, Adrian Martel and Dominique Kinisky the best in the air on their hoops). "

1384,1384,Ought To Be Clowns,17/10/2010,Ian,Tomorrow Morning, Landor Theatre,"First shown at the New End Theatre in 2006, Tomorrow Morning is a new contemporary musical from British writer Laurence Mark Wythe which is now playing at the Landor Theatre in Clapham. It had a successful run in Chicago in 2008 which saw quite a few changes being introduced so this is a welcome opportunity to see this charming show in its new incarnation with a superb cast. I took advantage of the half-price preview offer so this is a review of a preview performance from 16th October. Wythe wrote the music, lyrics and book to this four-hander which follows two couples on the eve of life-changing events. One, Kat and John, are bundles of nerves, stressing out about their impending marriage and their life ahead; the other, John and Catherine, are older, more world-weary as they prepare to sign their divorce papers. Contrasting the headiness of young love and new beginnings with the realities of maintaining a marriage, the show offers a thoughtful, universal look into relationships with some genuinely appealing characters and some moving revelations. Whilst the main attraction for me was the opportunity to see Julie Atherton performing (I swear this woman is close to, if not the best, musical theatre actress in this country), I love contemporary musical theatre and feel that it does not get enough love in London. So I was pleased that Tomorrow Morning was decidedly melodic, structurally intricate and emotionally engaging. It is really quite witty and inventive lyrically, mostly avoiding cliché and there is an honesty to much of it that is most refreshing, given that the subject material is one which has been extensively covered before. In my limited experience, I think this fits stylistically quite close to Jason Robert Brown’s work, covering quite a few musical bases. But I was most impressed with the way in which Wythe can weave together different voices in a song: quite often all four characters would contribute their own viewpoints but always with great clarity and a real sense of musical cohesion. It helps when you have an amazing cast too though, working so hard: everyone remains onstage pretty much throughout the entire show so they have to be ‘on’ at all times which they all do so well. I’ve made my feelings about Julie Atherton clear but she really is superb, she is so good at the comic numbers, her delivery of the witticisms not even being hampered by a mouthful of Oreos. But it was nice to be surprised by Yvette Robinson who was sensationally good with a vocally strident performance which also captured the deep disillusionment and disappointment of Catherine. Jon Lee has a real likeability as his raffish screenwriter with a dirty addiction and Grant Neal delivered a strong performance with a character who is probably the weakest link in the chain, only gaining real depth towards the end, but he can wear the hell out of a purple shirt! Chris de Wilde’s design is a cleverly constructed wall of cupboards which allows for the full maximisation of the intimate space, providing storage space for props, opportunities for dance routines and some nice comic moments. And I can’t believe no one went to the wrong cupboard at any point (you will see what I mean), given how early in the run it is, that was seriously impressive! If I had to be picky, I wasn’t too keen on the replaying of messages left on answering machines to reveal key plot points, a device used throughout, as it took away from the liveness of the performance, the sound balance wasn’t quite right for them to be completely audible (admittedly I was sat close to the band and there’s still time to tweak it before opening night). The use of projections didn’t feel wholly integrated, they are used so sparingly that it was a surprise each time: my inclination would be to project the words of the messages as they are spoken, thereby presaging the final image which did work really well. And given the strength and cleverness of the humour of most of the show, I didn’t care for the occasional dip into easy humour with the Pool Boy song and the erectile dysfunction gags. So for a shining example of what contemporary musical theatre looks like at the moment, you can’t go far wrong with making a visit to the Landor in the next few weeks. Small-scale musicals, when they are this good and performed this well with great musical direction from David Randall and his band of three, are an absolute treasure and I recommend booking early for this one. I saw an earlier show and they hadn't quite got the cupboards sorted out…made for a funny moment or two. Clever use of the space though and a clever new musical that deserves to be heard more."
1385,1385,Ought To Be Clowns,22/04/2006,Ian,Hay Fever, Theatre Royal Haymarket,"Theatrical has-been Judith has not been taking to early retirement well and is hankering after a return to the stage as she’s had enough of her family. The play starts off with the family inviting various guests to stay for the weekend: Judith invites a fan, her husband has a ‘muse’ coming to visit and her son and daughter also invite a friend to stay, only trouble is, no-one has told anyone else they’re inviting anyone. Dench is very much playing against type here, in the kind of flouncy actress role we all know (or at least hope) she is not, and as a result so much of her performance is all the richer for being so unexpected. Dench as drama queen is great fun to watch and it is a vein I’d like to see her explore more. I particularly liked Belinda Lang and Peter Bowles’ performances, but as the son and daughter of the Bliss family, I found Dan Stevens and Kim Medcalf to be misguided in their choices, in particular Stevens’ hamming it up proved to be most wearing."
1386,1386,Ought To Be Clowns,08/03/2016,mag9l,Don’t Smoke in Bed, Finborough,"Both in their 30s and both professors of “obscure versified English”, Jamaican-American Richard and Irish-American Sheryl seem to have it made when they’re asked to take part in a series of ‘bedroom interviews’, the promise of a potential book deal luring them into agreement. Presuming their interracial relationship and their decision to start a family is the reason they’ve been scouted, they jump right into baring their souls to their webcam-based interviewer but soon discover that they’re not quite ready for the answers they’re about to reveal. Aurin Squires’ Don’t Smoke in Bed is a thrillingly incisive look into what Avenue Q memorably labelled “the sensitive subject of race”. Richard and Sheryl pride themselves on not arguing, rather enjoying having “strong conversations”, though as they begin to delve into the detail of how their partnership works and crucially, expose the perceptions that each has about the way that racial politics – and indeed class – has or hasn’t impacted on their lives, their certainties are crumbled away as brutal honesty corrodes the bonds that had seemed so tight. This increasing darkness works so well because Squires establishes the utterly charming nature of this couple from the very first line and director Andrew Twyman has cast the play perfectly in Greg Lockett and Clare Latham. Repartee bounces back and forth, first meetings are wittily reenacted and a real sense of shared intimacy sparks from the stage, dominated by the double bed at the heart of Emily May Sions’ design. And as they begin to probe into their hopes and fears at the prospect of parenthood, it’s hard not empathise deeply with them, such is their likeability.  But as deeper truths are unearthed, such as Sheryl’s fears of how society’s tendency to exclusively label biracial children as black might impact the relationship she has with her son, and the complexity of Richard’s family history and the terrible racism suffered by his parents, they are both unprepared for how the other will react. Squires absolutely nails the quandary of white liberal guilt, the impossibility of trying to show empathy about a situation you can know nothing of, but also how it can be twisted into a weapon, to shamelessly try and win any argument."
1387,1387,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2015,mag9l,It’s Like the 60s Never Happened, Royal Court,"The Royal Court’s The Big Idea strand of work commissions a range of responses to the plays running there and with Hangmen going great guns in the main house before heading over the Wyndham’s for a well-deserved West End transfer, I headed over this Saturday afternoon for It’s Like the 60s Never Happened. Four short plays, each “imagining a world where one of the major 1960s social political or technological innovations never happened”, performed in unexpected locations on the Royal Court site. I’ve been on a couple of similar theatrical trips here before and there’s something irresistible about getting to see the backstage nooks and crannies which are so inventively used. This time, we got to visit a rehearsal room, a little terraced garden, a stairwell and the office that sits behind those iconic red letters out front and though they may not sound the most inspirational of places, the way in which each of the directors used them really did cultivate the sense of something special. My favourite of the quartet was Amber Hsu’s A Corrosion Named Desire, Episode 1: The Hero Inside Me directed by Jude Christian. Here, it was exploration into space that took a different path to leave surreal conclusions about the shape of the Earth but also all-too-convincing chilling observations about challenging orthodoxy. Sargon Yelda and Joan Iyiola dealt extremely well with the swift scenes and sharp theatricality, Hsu and Christian showing masterfully what can be achieved even in 10 short minutes. "

1389,1389,Ought To Be Clowns,02/12/2017,Ian,Parliament Square, Bush,"With pretty much every production of hers that I see (most memorably Lela & Co. and I’d Rather Goya Robbed Me Of My Sleep Than Some Other Arsehole), Jude Christian is becoming one of those directors whose work cannot be missed. And with the 2015 Bruntwood Prize-winning Parliament Square, now opening at the Bush after an October premiere at the Royal Exchange, that reputation doesn’t look in any danger at all. She’s helped here by a magnificently fearless piece of writing from James Fritz, split almost schizophrenically into two contrasting parts. The first presents us with Kat, a woman on the precipice of leaving her husband and their young son to commit some unspeakable act, being urged along the way by an enigmatic figure far more bluntly daring than she seems to be. The second then takes us past the act, which failed, into an uncertain world of uneasy compromise.  It’s uneasy and uncertain because Fritz never spells out directly what it is that Kat is protesting about, what the change is that she wants to wreak on the world. And so his writing takes on an ephemeral but awesome power as it explores what it means to take direct action, the diametric opposition of self-sacrifice and familial responsibility blurred into something disturbingly compelling as Kat and her family tread their way through a world that is becoming increasingly dangerous. That sense of ominous foreboding is inculcated brilliantly by Fritz and Christian, in a second act passage that fast-forwards through a number of years, stopping every so often for jagged shards of dialogue weighed down with peril as the cast, perched on stools, slowly draw their feet as far up from the floor as they can. It’s a chillingly beautiful image, devastatingly effective, and one which helps the play to its glitteringly explosive end."
1390,1390,Ought To Be Clowns,17/01/2013,Ian,Rough Cuts – Bytes, Royal Court,"Just a quickie for this as the Royal Court’s Rough Cuts season is a space for short plays, experimental readings and works in progress and so I’m just including it here for the completeness of my theatregoing records. It has previously taken place in the upstairs theatre but as this is currently occupied, they have converted the Wilson rehearsal studio – right next to the main building – into a public performance space for this group of four pieces, all based on the theme of our relationship to the internet. This year’s cohort of writers made this a must-see from the moment it was announced, featuring as it does Alia Bano, DC Moore, Penelope Skinner and Nick Payne, and with an ensemble of six actors including Sarah Woodward and Al Weaver, I was confident of enjoying the performances too. And it was an agreeable evening from start to early finish – such a rarity to be home well before 9pm on a theatre night – and a pleasing indication of the vibrancy and variety in new theatre writing in the UK.  There was an interesting mix of styles, from what felt like fully-fleshed scenes from forthcoming plays to highly entertaining independent sketches, probing at the way in which technological advances, particularly the rise of the internet and smartphones, have invaded so much of our lives and changed the way in which we interact with each other. Nick Payne’s emotionally distant couple, forever distracted from genuinely connecting by the deluge of information online they can’t look away from, gave probably the funniest moments of the evening as the state of their relationship was cleverly dissected by having to go through items on a shared bank account to see if it had been hacked – Al Weaver and Rebecca Night both in great form here.  Penelope Skinner chose to look at the world of online commenting, also to amusing effect; Alia Bano took on the well-worn path of the dangers of social media for teachers and gave it a fresher feel which could well be fascinating if developed further; and DC Moore – one of my favourite new writers alongside Payne – gave us the most obscure but intriguing section, with his sci-fi-inspired musings which would win my vote as the one I most wanted to see more of."

1392,1392,Ought To Be Clowns,10/04/2016,mag9l,Radioman, Old Red Lion,"There’s a whole world of nostalgia wrapped up in certain sounds. For me, the clunk of a cassette ejecting evokes a childhood compiling mix-tapes of songs taped off the radio and so can’t help but make me smile whenever I hear it. And it is one sound of many that makes up the detailed soundscape of Radioman, which is live-mixed in front of us to accompany Felix Trench’s self-penned monologue for Crowley & Co. at the Old Red Lion. Trench’s Walker discovers a dilapidated canal-boat one day whilst out walking, a strange swell of music seeming to emanate from within. He could walk away but he’s intrigued – ‘who’d like in a house(boat) like this’ – and thus begins his adventures with The Gadfly, For it is no ordinary vessel, inside is the impossibly old Radioman and his piles of musical equipment and a strange relationship builds between the two in Tom Crowley’s production. To say much more would reveal too much as the joy of Radioman comes in the gentle unfolding of its telling. Trench is a highly charismatic storyteller and a richly evocative writer. The passing of the seasons eloquently glides “through figs and apples, gold leaves and black twigs”, the old man’s “sword-blade eyes sit…on metallic skin”, the prose is as vividly detailed as a short story which, as it is available as a playtext, is an indulgence you can treat yourself to read and reread at your leisure. It also means that there are the occasional moments of tension in the performance, adopted voices muddy the text and break the spell a little – I should say it’s only because it’s been so enchanting, you’ve been totally transported into this world, that this is noticeable. And creatively, the collaborations are perfectly judged. Anna Driftmier’s set suggests the skeletal nature of the boat but also hints towards something more futuristic and Marine Le Houëzec’s lighting shimmers beautifully around the whole theatre."
1393,1393,Ought To Be Clowns,11/04/2020,Ian,Jesus Christ Superstar (2018 Concert),,"The most striking thing about the US Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert from 2018, that will particularly stand out to those who saw the Regents Park Open Air Theatre production in any of its iterations, is that it is boldly credited to David Leveaux as director and Jason Ardizzone-West as production designer. There’s so much synchronicity between the two productions here that it is hard to believe that Timothy Sheader and Tom Scutt respectively didn’t deserve at least thanks if not full co-credits because original this is not. A live television musical special – as the Americans did much more of than the Brits – this version of Jesus Christ Superstar is undoubtedly heavily influenced by the freshness of that iconic reimagining of the show. Released from its 70s origins but also any need to be particularly politically relevant (which tripped up the UK arena tour) it is a powerful piece of contemporary theatre which speaks to the cult of celebrity as pointedly as it ever has done."
1394,1394,Ought To Be Clowns,17/04/2016,mag9l,Hamilton, Richard Rodgers Theatre,"Where to begin? Could anyone have expected the phenomenal success of Hamilton? Turning into the biggest Broadway hit of an age, accepting invitations to the White House, reinventing day queue culture, being the subject of made-up scandals, winning Grammys, all while radically challenging traditional notions of musical theatre. The build up of such hype has been thrilling to see but also poses questions like ‘could it really possibly be that good?’. And ‘how on earth does one get tickets for find out for oneself?’. In short, the answers are yes and by booking months ahead in my case. I deliberately hadn’t listened to the original cast recording when it was released as I wanted to experience it for the first time on stage and knowing full well that I would get to see it one way or another, I also denied myself any of the multifarious online offerings so that the first I saw of Hamilton would be as the curtain rose at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. And I have to say the anticipation and delayed gratification was completely worth it – that said, I’ve struggled to write about the show in a satisfactory way (“I will never be satisfied…”) so treat this as an outpouring rather than a review. Miranda’s blend of musical styles may be familiar to those who have seen In the Heights but here he takes it even further, transplanting this utterly contemporary approach to music onto a historical narrative and thoroughly invigorating them both with an amazing sense of alchemy. So the story of the founding fathers creating the United States, with specific reference to the meteoric rise of Alexander Hamilton from inauspicious beginnings, takes place in a sung-through mixture of contemporary R&B, hip-hop, jazz and blues, as well as a keen sense for a Broadway melody. Its pretty much impossible to adequately describe how Hamilton made me feel, I mean I get goosebumps even now just thinking about it and how much I loved it and how excited I felt when watching it. And I’d be hard pressed to tell you exactly why. I could point to the moment when Renée Elise Goldsberry’s Angelica lets loose a stunning torrent of conflicted heartfelt emotion in ‘Satisfied’, or the gorgeous harmonies as she and her sister Eliza (Philippa Soo) try to persuade Alexander to take some downtime in ‘Take a Break’ (my two standout musical moments) Or Leslie Odom Jr’s smooth ‘Wait For It’ (which feels for anything as if it could have been on Rihanna’s latest album) or the striking arrival of ‘The Schuyler Sisters’ (that bass line…work!) or the sheer magnificence of ‘Non-Stop’ and its gathering together of so many diverse musical themes into a thunderclap of an Act 1 closer. You get the idea, I pretty much loved it all, its such a densely packed score that it benefits from repeated listens, almost requires it in fact, and each time a new favourite emerges, especially having had a certain few tracks on repeat. I had Javier Muñoz on for an indisposed Miranda as the zealous Hamilton and he was just on fire, giving us all the shades of a man from nation-building hero and father (I am undone…swoon!) to wife-cheating disappointment, Daveed Diggs’ is highly engaging as Lafayette and Jefferson as is Okieriete Onaodowan’s as Mulligan and Madison. And I was pleased to have caught Jonathan Groff in one of his last performances as King George III, a minor but attention-grabbing role. And in case it wasn’t clear, Phillipa Soo and the extraordinary Renée Elise Goldsberry are both fantastic, whether beat-boxing, rapping or singing their hearts out. Creatively it just rocks too. David Korin’s expansive set design is just awesome, lit stunningly by Howell Binkley and Andy Blankenbuehler’s choreography sparkles with its infusion of contemporary movement that elevates it into something truly beautiful in all the interrupted shapes it makes. And I’ve not even touched on the brilliant nature of the show’s diversity and what that actually means for an audience in a country where racial relations remain such a hot button topic but also for a traditional theatrical culture that could never have predicted Hamilton’s success. The fact that people are breaking down the doors to see this show might easily be written off as hype, as a knee-jerk reaction for people wanting to see the next new big thing without actually having to think about what they’re choosing. But no matter the reasons for that lucky few getting through that door, the reality of them seeing people of colour playing historical figures, who have most likely never been represented as anything but lily-white, marks something that one desperately hopes marks something of a cultural shift or at least the beginnings of one. Naive perhaps, but that’s the joy of Hamilton, it makes you believe that that change is possible. "
1395,1395,Ought To Be Clowns,13/09/2009,Ian,Hello, Dolly!,"Admittedly, I did not see it in the heights of summer when one might expect a slightly better chance of sunshine, but one did start to question the methods of the Open Air Theatre on rainy days, as the stagehands were made to work extremely hard, wiping down the stage diligently four times in 45 minutes before the actual start of the show. One began to feel so sorry for them as it seemed every time they finished a new shower would begin. Fortunately, the sheer joy of the production meant that the conditions were soon forgotten.  The plot concerns Dolly Levi, a widowed matchmaker from New York, who is well known for her well-intentioned interventions, who has set her eye on Horace Vandergelder and in order to prove her love for him, has to neogotiate the lovelives of at least three other couples around them. Samantha Spiro is just superb as the titular Dolly. Her singing and dancing may not necessarily be of the highest order, but her performance transcends this as she carries the whole show on a wave of warmth and ebullience. Her meddling only ever seems to come from a place of love, and this is shown by the genuine affection shown to her by the entire cast. Vandergelder was played by an understudy on the night I saw it, and he could probably have done a little more to show us some of the underlying kindness beneath the gruffness, to show us what it is that attracts Dolly so. Of the supporting roles, Josefina Gabrielle as the flirty milliner Irene Molloy, and Daniel Crossley as Cornelius Hackl, Vandergelder’s hard-done-by employee were both excellent, investing their sub-plot with much humour and pathos (Crossley’s dancing in particular was a sight to behold), so much so that I cared as much about this relationship as I did about Dolly’s, which is most probably want Dolly would want us to feel anyway. Staging-wise it looks good, the wooden set showing some flexibility as each of the key locations and with some imaginative use of flags and material to add some real vibrancy to some numbers, but it was the choreography that really set this production above the rest in terms of sheer quality. The two set pieces for ‘Waiters’ Gallop’ and ‘Put On Your Sunday Clothes’ have to rank as amongst my favourite things seen on stage this year and were worth the entrance fee alone. The group numbers are performed with infectious happiness that I constantly found myself just beaming at the spectacle."
1396,1396,Ought To Be Clowns,02/12/2015,mag9l,Funny Girl, Menier Chocolate Factory,"As recently demonstrated with Adele’s 25, there comes a point where commercial success just trumps critical response even before the reviews have been published and digested. The Menier Chocolate Factory’s revival of Funny Girl broke box office records in selling out its entire run in mere moments, announcing its transfer to the West End and then selling a vast majority of tickets for the Savoy all before the show had even opened, such is the draw of star Sheridan Smith. So in some ways it doesn’t matter that Funny Girl really isn’t a great show, one unseen in the West End for nearly 50 years. Musically, Jule Styne’s score front-loads its hits fatally and dramatically, Isobel Lennart’s rather insipid book runs out of steam well before the end, even with Harvey Fierstein’s newly introduced revisions. And for all of the strengths of Michael Mayer’s production, there’s little it manages to do paper over these cracks. It helps that Smith really is possessed of that elusive star quality that (almost) justifies such advance sales. As Fanny Brice, whose journey from backstreet bars in Brooklyn to top billing in the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway made a legend out of original star Barbra Streisand, she has the emotional range to cover the hilarious heights of this singer and comedian at work and also the heartbreaking lows as her personal life suffers considerable strain. Vocally though, there’s a lot to live up with La Streisand and I would say Smith was strong rather than sensational, she doesn’t quite seem to have the innate confidence yet to really transcend the material, played beautifully by Alan Williams’ band. She connects well with Darius Campbell as her errant husband though, despite the role’s underwritten shortcomings, and there’s vivid work from Marilyn Cutts, Gay Soper and Valda Aviks as Fanny’s mother and friends.  There’s something frustrating too about the all-too-palpable sense that Mayer clearly has had his eye on the Savoy from the outset. Michael Pavelka’s elegant design with its reflective surfaces and ingenious travelators and Lynne Page’s expansive choreography both push at the seams of the intimate Menier but at these ticket prices and for a 3 and a half month run, it doesn’t feel like too much to ask for a show perfectly designed for this space, which is then latterly adapted for the transfer."
1397,1397,Ought To Be Clowns,12/02/2019,Ian,Avenue Q, New Wimbledon Theatre,"I do love Avenue Q. It was one of the first musicals that I fell in love with after moving to London, tracking it throughout its West End-theatre hopping run with multiple visits (a recap can be found here) and then popping in here and there to catch the occasional touring version. And it is a show to which my reactions have shifted: 13 years ago when I first saw it, its quarter-life crisis was directly recognisable; a little way down the line now, I’m the one saying ‘these kids are so much younger than me’ about this youthful company! Premiering in 2003, the show – music and lyrics by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx and book by Jeff Whitty – benefited hugely from coming into life in a slightly more innocent pre-social media time, a moment when Generation X didn’t face half as much opprobrium as millennia are forced to shoulder nowadays. And revisiting the show now, as this Sell A Door production kicks off a major UK tour scheduled to last most of the year, it is just lovely to be reminded of simpler times, of such uncomplicated good feeling. Director and choreographer Cressida Carré has got it just right here, injecting a fresh sense of energy but one which respects that this material still needs very little tinkering. Its after-hours Sesame Street format remains as sharply observant as ever, as it picks away at how little university prepares us for the harsher truths of real life, yet always remaining fondly affectionate about the gaining of that experience. Getting wasted, getting laid, getting fired, sometimes all within 24 hours –  there’s just so much truth about city living here! And I may be bitter at how young they are, the cast are certainly on top of their game. Tom Steedon as Nicky and Trekkie is brilliantly assured as both characters, Lawrence Smith (fresh from an excellent turn in Brass last year) impresses as Princeton and Rod and Saori Oda’s Christmas Eve is a fantastically garish comic presence. And if I say Cecily Rodman could afford to be a bit looser and loucher to differentiate Lucy the Slut from her sweetly poised Kate Monster, it’s only because I’m (unfairly) comparing her to Julie Atherton’s iconic original interpretation.  A treat then, to be able to revisit a show that is still in remarkably good shape and in these hands, looks set to win over a whole new generation of fans. "
1398,1398,Ought To Be Clowns,02/07/2015,mag9l,The Importance of Being Earnest, Vaudeville,
1399,1399,Ought To Be Clowns,03/07/2013,Ian,Twelfth Night, Propeller at Hampstead Theatre,"It’s over six months since Propeller started their most recent tour and so a similar amount of time since I saw Twelfth Night back in Guildford, a production I enjoyed immensely and ranked as my 13th favourite of the year. And as is now their wont, their tour makes a late stop at Edward Hall’s London abode at the Hampstead Theatre for an extended stay where both their productions (The Taming of the Shrew is the other this time round) will play in rep. Getting to revisit a show like this is something of a luxury and a rare opportunity at that, I ummed and aahed briefly about booking again but the lure of the front row was too strong for me to resist.  And I am glad I went back for seconds, for this really is my kind of Shakespearean comedy. Not so much in the all-male playing of it but rather in the restraint with which it goes for the laughs, concentrating instead on a tone of sustained melancholy. In emphasising the bittersweet notes as it does – from the start, it is clear Liam O’Brien’s Feste prefers a more mournful ballad – the play is given, for me at least, a greater sense of depth. A real feeling of loneliness, pain and bitterness to so many of these characters creates an ideal counterweight to the broad humour once it comes and makes us feel their ups and downs so much more. With their customary level of detail on these characters, Edward Hall’s company really bring a revivifying freshness to the play that makes a new kind of sense out of such familiar things. Vince Leigh’s embittered Sir Toby is extraordinary – there’s something tragic about his insistence on maintaining a lifestyle of drunken carousing with John Dougall’s doddery Aguecheek – both men trying to live off past glories -but there’s also still something of a roguish glint in his eye and the way in which his relationship with Gary Shelford’s self-assured Maria is sketched out hides none of their mutual attraction and shows their eventual betrothal as a natural progression. Similarly, the soul-searching anguish wracking Christopher Heyward’s Duke Orsino makes him a much more sympathetic figure than usual, Chris Myles brings enough bite to his Malvolio to make him someone that people would actually want to plot against, and even Finn Hanlon’s Antonio strikes us hard emotionally with his obvious affection for Sebastian. This is a red-blooded take on Twelfth Night from top to bottom though, giving us a strong sense of the burgeoning sexuality that drives so many of them. Ben Allen’s Olivia cannot wait to rip off her mourning clothes to get it on with Joseph Chance’s Cesario or indeed Dan Wheeler’s Sebastian and one really feels the charge between Orsino and Cesario too, a feeling that something meaningful really could happen there."
1400,1400,Ought To Be Clowns,29/05/2018,Ian,Into the Woods, Cockpit,"One of the main reasons that fairytales have endured as long as they have is that they are timeless, their messages recited as-is at bedsides since time immemorial. Recognising this, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s Into the Woods gives us a first half which takes us deep into this enchanted world as we know it and waiting until after the interval to show us what happens after happy ever after.  So the notion of updating the show to a specifically 21st-century context is an intriguing one, as director Tim McArthur draws in influences such as The Only Way is Essex, Made in Chelsea and Rab C Nesbitt. On the one hand, it offers a fresh take on well-known characters; on the other, it also provides a distracting layer onto characters that barely need it. The result is a well-performed interpretation that rarely feels essential.  For the best performances largely come from those unburdened by the conceit. Jo Wickham’s deeply compassionate Bakers Wife, Jordan Michael Todd’s clear-sighted Narrator, Abigail Carter-Simpson’s beautifully voiced Cinderella, Florence Odumosu’s self-possessed Little Red Riding Hood (admittedly, having her cape be a hoodie is a great innovation). But if Ashley Daniels and Michael Duke do give strong work with their SW10 princes (their ‘Agony’ is a real highlight, yaah), Jack and his mother are lumbered with a dour Glaswegian characterisation that saps the life (and intelligibility) out of their storyline. Crucially, this predilection to the darker side of the tracks means that there’s nowhere to go in the second half, the necessary contrast is missing.  McArthur’s direction doesn’t quite utilise the space well enough either, tending too much to the static. Joana Dias’ inventive design of ladders and crates looks great in the round but too often, the action lacks the fluidity to embrace the audience watching from all sides. Aaron Clingham’s musical direction is noteworthy though, doing justice to the effortless melodies of Sondheim’s score."
1401,1401,Ought To Be Clowns,11/12/2017,Ian,Thirty Christmases, New Diorama,"As many of us lurch from swapping random Secret Santa gifts at office parties to necking eggnog at pantos (just me?!) in preparation for the culinary bliss that is my dad’s Christmas dinner, it is easy to forget that the festive season is necessarily a happy one for everyone. And it is this feeling that Supporting Wall’s Thirty Christmases (in association with Arts at the Old Fire Station and the New Diorama) is concerned with exploring, through this bittersweetly wry and affecting comedy. Written by Jonny Donahoe and directed by Alice Hamilton, it’s the story of siblings Jonny and Rachel who haven’t spent Christmas together in nearly ten years due to a big falling out. Through the efforts of their mutual friend Paddy, they’ve come together to delve into their shared past to try and work out their issues, for it turns out they’ve never actually had a conventional Christmas at all, due to a chaotic upbringing by their single-parent socialist firebrand of a father. And with the help of songs by Donahoe and Paddy Gervers in lieu of expensive therapy sessions, the trio act out the succession of crazy Christmases they spent abusing the hospitality of others as their father didn’t even believe in owning a house. It’s a clever approach that allows them to skewer so many of the cosy nonsenses that have built up around this time of year – glib sentiments in charity singles, the outright creepiness endorsed in songs like ‘Santa Baby’ and ‘I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus’, the very nature of eggnog itself."
1402,1402,Ought To Be Clowns,13/06/2010,Ian,Playing the Game, Women,"Bola Agbaje’s contribution is Playing the Game, following three university housemates as the election for a new Students’ Association fast approaches. Akousa is interested in running but unsure if she is popular enough so her trendy housemates set about raising her profile, giving her makeovers, sexing her up and utilising any means possible to get her name out there. Their motives aren’t necessarily pure though and Akousa is forced to examine how far she is willing to go and how much she is willing to compromise in order to gain power. Following the mantra that any publicity is good publicity, this was a good look at the ways viral marketing, social media and instant news can be used and abused to get your message across, especially to younger people, but also in the way that these things can be manipulated to present anything any way you choose. Lara Rossi and Claire Cox were very good as the key manipulators Jenny and Charlene pushing, prodding and primping their flatmate as a tool to achieve their ambitions, fully aware of how sex sells and what makes their world go round in the pursuit of their individualistic aims at the expense of the collective good. Amy Loughton was excellent as the young woman slowly coming to the realisation that there are always limits to how far one can go in order to get what one wants but also that personal savviness is an essential characteristic in achieving success."
1403,1403,Ought To Be Clowns,01/03/2015,mag9l,Songs of Lear, Battersea Arts Centre,"It’s Shakespeare but not as you know it… It’s been over four years since I saw Polish company Song of the Goat but their haunting interpretation of Macbeth is still etched on my mind and so when they announced a return of their 2012 hit Songs of Lear I was keen to make a date during their short visit to Battersea Arts Centre. Not even a severe case of manflu could keep me away but I should probably apologise for passing on my germs to anyone who ended up with them!  There’s no easy way to describe the work of Song of the Goat that really does them sufficient justice. I could talk about the expressionistic Kandinsky-inspired sketches that King Lear is condensed to create the 10 songs of the show but their enigmatic beauty is so much more than a simple reduction. Likewise, the words ‘Corsican polyphonic singing’ can’t convey the soul-wrenching beauty of what we hear (the merest snippet of which can be heard in the clip below)."

Skin A Cat opened eyes as they opened their doors last month and now it is the turn of Philip Ridley’s similarly arresting Tonight with Donny Stixx.  The inimitable characteristics of Ridley’s writing are as complex as Sondheim’s magisterial musical theatre and equally, they respond to creatives who are well-versed in his ways. So regular Ridley director David Mercatali is at the helm of this monologue, (a kind of sibling to Dark Vanilla Jungle) with Sean Michael Verey performing, following on from their collaboration on Radiant Vermin, which also starred DVJ’s Gemma Whelan."
1406,1406,Ought To Be Clowns,25/07/2017,Ian,Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, Young Vic at the Apollo,"Whatever the reasons behind the decision to open Benedict Andrews’ Cat On A Hot Tin Roof directly into the West End, a first for the Young Vic, you can’t help suspect that it has been informed by the extraordinary success of their 2014 collaboration on A Streetcar Named Desire. Equally, it is tempting to feel the play would be better off on The Cut, the better for its intimacy to really sizzle. There’s certainly the attempt to raise the temperature – Andrews has his leads Jack O’Connell and Sienna Miller in various states of undress for large swathes of the play – but for all the skin exposed, there’s little sexuality between Tennessee Williams’ central couple, the reasons for which are painstakingly revealed later on. And ultimately it is a disconnect that reads better than it plays. The play has been uprooted to an undefined, vaguely contemporary time and space but where, say, van Hove’s A View From The Bridge made that feel truly elemental, here certain decisions impose a weird sense of specificity – mobile phones, that poor cake. That said, the unrelenting glistening of Magda Willi’s superbly gaudy design creates a peculiarly apt kind of prison for this troubled family.  In there, O’Connell’s Brick battles his twin demons of alcoholism and the well of repressed feeling fuelling it, and Miller’s Maggie prowls in desperate search for the connection she craves. Quite why the Mississippi accents of the original are maintained is unsure, especially since both have their struggles with it, but both respond well to the physical and psychological challenges of their roles.  Colm Meaney also impresses as Big Daddy, the ailing patriarch whose birthday celebrations the play centres around, a crucial scene with Brick is packed with emotive power, and there’s strong, detailed work from the smaller characters – Lisa Palfrey, Hayley Squires and Brian Gleeson as the ‘lesser’ family members all with a beady and greedy eye on the finer details of how the estate will be bequeathed. "
1407,1407,Ought To Be Clowns,17/02/2016,mag9l,The War of the Worlds, Dominion,"You have to love the creative process that ends with the thought ‘we need Jimmy Nail’, but Jeff Wayne’s musical version of The War of the Worlds really isn’t like any other show. A quick glimpse at the casts of previous arena tours, of which there have been many, gives a bit of insight as to their mindset – (former) pop stars like Westlife’s Brian McFadden, Jason Donovan and Atomic Kitten’s Liz McClarnon, reality show offcasts like Rhydian, even the Kaiser Chiefs’ Ricky Wilson – now a judge on The Voice – has got in on the act. And now The War of the Worlds has landed at the Dominion Theatre and the casting has gotten no less random. This time, I think someone came across a copy of Now 51 in a charity shop and so we have Daniel Bedingfield and former Sugababe Heidi Range making their West End debuts, alongside original cast member David Essex (whose character is naturally named The Voice of Humanity), Michael Praed and Madalena Alberto who, as per the poster, has the ridiculous snub of being the only one not to get a headshot (though she will be used to billing controversies in this theatre by now). And then there’s Jimmy Nail who at 61 gets Range, 32, as his wife…, it all makes for an oddly compelling though deeply strange affair.  For the uninitiated, of whom I was one, Jeff Wayne’s The War of the Worlds is a 1978 prog rock concept album, adapting the HG Wells story of the same name, and currently ranks as the 39th best-selling album of all time in the UK. So of course it has been adapted into its various touring incarnations in capacious arenas and then further retooled into this stage version but that doesn’t ensure it is a theatrical success, not at all. Instead, there’s an array of disparate elements on show which sit awkwardly with each other and never mesh into a cohesive whole, all overseen by a holographic figure of Liam Neeson flatly narrating the story.  Wayne conducts his band, augmented by a string orchestra, on floating platforms; the soloists waft around the stage in isolation, even when singing together; a mishmash of videos and projections play – historical film stock clashes with footage filmed specially for this (though not featuring anyone actually on stage), half-decent CGI is undermined by generic splodges of what looks like a screensaver and worse, a chronically bad, arthritic robot prop which recalls nothing so much as one of The Tripods from my 80s childhood which thoroughly undermines any menace that might have been coming (not to mention the alien that looks like a rotting lettuce leaf, never underestimate the power of the unseen)."
1408,1408,Ought To Be Clowns,24/11/2010,Ian,Taken – Charged, Soho Theatre,"In what was the final play of the first day for me, Winsome Pinnock’s Taken looks at how three generations of a family are each affected by the decision to give up a child. Fresh out of rehab and coming to terms with the damage she caused as a drug addict, Della has returned to her mother’s council flat to help care and clean for her as she is struggling to manage on her own. When she is paid a visit by a young woman claiming to be the daughter she gave up, she is forced to confront the painful realities of her decision. Beatie Edney was very good as Della, the woman barely able to acknowledge that she was so deep in her addiction that she can’t really recognise whether it really is the daughter she gave up. Rebecca Oldfield uses a manipulative edginess well as the could-be daughter and Janet Henfrey is painfully moving as Nane Nola, suffering from some dementia-like affliction but still able to have moments of startling revelatory acuity that pierce to the truth of what really happened."
1409,1409,Ought To Be Clowns,05/04/2015,mag9l,Death of a Salesman, Royal Shakespeare Theatre,"To criticise an RSC production of being traditional seems a little bit beside the point, especially under this artistic directorship, but that’s how I felt on leaving this production of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. It is undoubtedly impressive but it rarely feel inspired, it just doesn’t do enough to convince that the sobriquet “greatest American play of the 20th century” (as Doran labels it in the programme) is well-deserved, especially in the light of such revelatory work being done on one of Miller’s other plays even as we speak. Antony Sher’s Willy Loman, the American Dreamer who never quite gets there, has been done in by life. Business as a travelling salesman has dried up, his older son has severely disappointed him and ghosts of the past plague his mind so virulently that they seem real. Miller weaves in scenes of the Lomans’ past most ingeniously into Willy’s current day affairs but though Sher gives us all of the abrasiveness of a frustrated would-be patriarch, his performance lacks the psychological intensity to really pull you into his thought processes.  Harriet Walter’s portrayal of Linda actually emerges the stronger. In the face of disinterest from both Miller, for a dynastic epic, her character is unforgivably sidelined, and from Doran/Sher who make precious little attempt to show us even a hint of what might have made her devotion to the Lomans’ marriage endure so long, Walter brings forth an innate integrity that makes her an essential presence throughout. The measured precision of her movement, even on the sidelines, never lets us forget how deeply she feels each twist of the family’s torments. Sam Marks and Alex Hassell have a trickier job as their sons, playing not only the comparative disillusionment of their adult selves but the fizzing exuberance of their younger years in the flashback scenes as we see the hugely formative experiences inflicted by their father. They pull it off though, with a demonstrable chemistry and a considered touch to the changing power dynamic in their sibling relationship. Strong work too from Joshua Richards and Brodie Ross as a contrasting father/son from across the way and Ross Green’s waiter Stanley makes a vivid but compelling cameo late on. "
1410,1410,Ought To Be Clowns,28/04/2011,Ian,REDfest, Old Red Lion,"REDfest is a new festival hosted at the Old Red Lion Theatre celebrating “the very best in new writing” Over 100 short plays were submitted, and they’ve been whittled down to the best 18 which are being presented here in three groups of six. Audiences have the opportunity to rank the six plays they’ve been in order of preference and the top two from each group will be invited to return for the final week, where they will play again and a winner selected. The victorious playwright will then be invited to write a full length work for the theatre next year. Group 1 featured a slightly reduced line-up: John Grogan’s Old Street was M.I.A. but the other five more than made up for it with an eclectic mix of new writing dissecting everything from strained relationships, alien abductions and acting classes. Given that these were only short pieces, it was interesting to see the hugely different ways in which the playwrights set about their task and with a varied degree of success. The stronger ones were those that pulled us into their little worlds and gave hints about what might have happened before and hopefully leaving us wanting to find out more, but focusing on telling a strong story at the centre of it all. Mike Carter’s A Peaceful Resolution was the best of the lot (and at least four people near me agreed!) with its two-hander about a whistle-blower going up against the government and wrestling with issues around whether moral questionability is ever acceptable in individuals or state institutions, evoking images of David Kelly but also Julian Assange. Powerfully acted by Grahame Edwards and James Sobol Kelly with director Dan Horrigan keeping a taut intensity to proceedings, this is the one to watch. Philip Ayckbourn’s Internet Connection was the best of the comedies, a wryly observed piece about a warring couple who each find release through a bit of sneaky online dating, but in creating ideal fake personae, they find themselves falling for each other again and sharing their frustrations and desires to each other, unaware of who they’re really talking too. Ayckbourn has a sharp ear for the sparky dialogue of this feuding pair, played well by Grace Halladay and Andrew Bloomer, particularly the tiny things that annoy people and there was much truth in his analysis of the difficulties that can arise in communicating with those closest to us and conversely how easy it can be to talk to strangers on a computer screen. Alien by Greg Lawrence was a little bit absurd, a little bit intriguing and really rather funny as a blind date with a rather unexpected twist; Frank Osborne’s Acting 101 stretched out its joke about a drama class led by a pompous act-tor well and with some humour, though it was hard to see where else it could go but Letters to Lilly by John Hayden suffered from trying to cram too much into tortured family history into its short running time. We barely had time to work out who the two men on stage were before launching into the troubled family tree, meaning there was no time to get involved with either character or their extended family and matters weren’t helped by some rather clunky acting. So an eclectic group for sure, but one showing an interesting diversity to new playwriting that surely bodes well for the future. If you’re a little unsure about booking, then perhaps wait for the final week when the 18 will have been further whittled down to the best 6 and so you’re guaranteed quality across the board, but for those willing to take the chance (and I reckon you should!), go for it!  "
1411,1411,Ought To Be Clowns,11/07/2016,mag9l,After Miss Julie, Richmond,  
1412,1412,Ought To Be Clowns,26/09/2011,Ian,South Downs/The Browning Version, Minerva,"There have been quite a few revivals of Terence Rattigan shows in theatres across the country to mark his centenary year but leading them all has been Chichester Festival Theatre’s summer season which has paid tribute to the dramatist by both putting on productions of his plays and commissioning new works that have been inspired by his writings. This double bill incorporates both of those by pairing Rattigan’s one-acter The Browning Version with David Hare’s South Downs, newly written as a response to the former. Both plays take place inside public schools, dealing with issues of insecurity and identity in such institutions and the loneliness that can strike whether through failing to fit in or losing oneself so thoroughly in dry academia. South Downs takes the pupils as a starting point, John Blakemore being a precocious 14 year old on a scholarship who doesn’t fit in with his upper-class contemporaries and whose budding intellectualism and refusal to abide by convention rattles his teachers: a nicely irascible Andrew Woodall and a kindly Nicholas Farrell. There’s something of a fantasia to Hare’s constructions here which doesn’t quite totally work: the idyllic benevolence of an urbane prefect and his sympathetic actress mother seems a little too good to be true, especially as Blakemore’s familial relations didn’t seem as bad as all that. Though ultimately, I could hardly blame Alex Lawther’s excellently awkward John for falling for the dreamy Jonathan Bailey and Anna Chancellor’s Fortnum and Mason-cake bearing thespian. And Hare can’t resist the temptation to make John so supremely erudite yet completely unwilling to play the game to just get along. But Jeremy Herrin’s sweeping production, adorned with old school hymns and a healthy sense of pace, both amuses and entertains. Rattigan’s The Browning Version is in another class though, Angus Jackson directing with devastating precision this tale of an ailing Classic professor facing early retirement without his promised pension but with a wife who doesn’t love him. Nicholas Farrell really excels as Crocker-Harris, subtly suggesting the bright professor that once was, now weighed down by years of dutiful repression and thoroughly shaken by the belated revelation of what his pupils think of him. Anna Chancellor is again outstanding as his elegant wife, herself something of a victim though bitterly harsh when given the chance and she connects well with Mark Umbers, her lover who is also a colleague of her husband."
1413,1413,Ought To Be Clowns,29/07/2009,Ian,Matthew Bourne’s Dorian Gray,,"I generally do not go to much dance and so cannot comment with much authority on the finer points of the quality of the choreography, but I can say that I found it most entertaining. The combination of the at times classical dancing between pairs and the modern, almost pop video-like group dances worked very well, and there was a surprising amount of humour worked into the dance as well. My lack of dance knowledge perhaps made me focus more on the storytelling, and I find it incredible how well the piece did in relating the action with not a word being said. The only area that needed a little clarity for me was with the doppelganger: I wasn’t sure whether he was a real character that had appeared on the scene or meant to just be an alter ego of Dorian himself. Richard Winsor as the beautiful, tortured Dorian and Michele Meazza as the coldly ambitious Lady H were both superb in their own rights, but also radiating electric chemistry in their scenes together. Indeed, I think the straight sex scenes were a bit more successful in creating the necessary erotic feel than the numerous representations of gay sex that were thrown at us. I am not sure what it was, but gay sex through the medium of modern dance did nothing for me! Where the piece did succeed though was in the seduction scenes, and the pas de deux (if that is what it was!) between Dorian and Basil with his camera was highly erotically charged and I thought the flashing of the pictures on the wall behind as they were taken was inspired. So whilst this didn’t quite match up to the dizzy heights of Bourne’s re-envisioning of Swan Lake, which blew me away when I first saw it a long, long time ago, this was still a most entertaining evening out and made me think maybe I should bite the bullet and go and see more dance shows."
1414,1414,Ought To Be Clowns,12/03/2019,Ian,Medea, Barbican,"I first saw Simon Stone’s Medea in Amsterdam, in Dutch, without surtitles, and it was a revelatory experience which has lingered long in my memory as one of the best classical adaptations I’ve ever seen. So the chance to revisit it at the Barbican, once again anchored by the incomparable Marieke Heebink in Bob Cousins’ stunning design was unmissable. And it did not disappoint in its ferocious retelling of Euripides’ classic, as Stone makes it feel urgent and chilling and all-too-appalling believable in its depiction of a woman pushed to the edge. Poleaxed by the revelation of her husband’s affair with his boss’s daughter, her extreme actions saw her committed to a psychiatric institution. A year later on her release, she craves a fresh start but finds the world has moved on without her. Heebink is extraordinary. Her Anna is an accomplished doctor in her own right and appropriately for where society is today, finds that she has to do battle with mediocre masculinity, a blight that has taken its toll on her career as well as her sanity. Aus Greidanus Jr’s Lucas is no real villain, just a man who has taken taken taken what the patriarchy had to offer, little concerned with its impact on the woman he chose as his partner.  The ensemble of Internationaal Theater Amsterdam (formerly Toneelgroep Amsterdam) comes up trumps all around though. Faas Jonkers and Poema Kitseroo as the gangly teenage kids are perfect as they’re caught in the headwinds, not quite old enough to get everything but nowhere near young enough to escape unscathed. The moment you realise their fates is simply extraordinary as it eloquently reminds us that they’re just kids godammit."
1415,1415,Ought To Be Clowns,13/12/2012,Ian,Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, New Wimbledon Theatre,"I’ve pretty much decided to eschew pantomimes this year, not for any particular dislike of the form but rather in a month where I’m trying to fit in something of a social life alongside the theatre, something has to give. But when I was offered the chance to be someone else’s plus one for once for the New Wimbledon panto, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, I couldn’t resist just the one trip to festive frolics. The big name here this year is Priscilla Presley, making her stage debut at the age of 67, who takes on the role of the wicked queen Morgiana, determined to hold onto her title as the fairest in the land.  After an impressive entrance, Presley’s opening scene left me holding my breath a little as the rhyming verse seemed to strangle any sense of personality and came across as a little stiff. But she soon warmed up beautifully and really got into the mood – vamping around the stage to tunes like ‘One Way or Another’ and ‘Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)’, playing up to the audience’s boos and ripping her way hilariously through a script full of references that must have flown over her head – some pronunciations were amusingly awry and her quizzically hesitant delivery of ‘…Olly Murs?’ made a mildly amusing joke into a classic, but it is great to see such a star throwing themselves whole-heartedly into the task at hand.  The real star of the show though turns out to be Jarred Christmas, the Kiwi Flight of the Conchords star whose rapid-fire jokes, varied accents and general tomfoolery were a delight and frequently had me howling with laughter. His Herman the Henchman is so effective that it almost makes Lee Carroll’s Muddles, the more traditional panto clown, redundant as he’s left in the dust when it comes to the humour and the audience participation (‘Hello Muddles…, and an unintentionally hilarious trip through The Music Man with the most unwilling 11 year old boy) doesn’t always fly in his hands.  The dwarves are most enjoyable though. Led by Warwick Davies as Prof (and I couldn’t quite work out why the others had been renamed), there’s huge fun to be had whether in the running Ellie Simmonds gag, the flying across the stage or the party pieces they’re all preparing for a talent show. Against these, the leads of Lizzy Jay Hughes’ Snow White and James Austen-Murray’s Prince came across as rather bland – little attempt made to freshen these characters and so there’s not quite the investment in their future that one might hope for."
1416,1416,Ought To Be Clowns,04/12/2009,Ian,Mrs Klein, Almeida,"Struggling to come to terms with the death of her son Hans in a climbing accident, noted controversial psychoanalyst Melanie Klein asks a colleague to cover for her while she goes to the funeral. Paula, recently escaped from the rising anti-Semitic persecution in Germany, is finding it hard to make a living in London and agrees to this, but is interrupted by the arrival of Klein’s daughter Melitta also a psychoanalyst, resentful of her presence and angry with her mother’s domineering behaviour. After Mrs Klein herself returns unexpectedly, Paula gets caught up in the longstanding conflict between mother and daughter which comes to crisis point in the wake of revelations about Hans’s death. It may have just been the result of a long weekend and a long day in the office, but I found the first half to be crushingly dull. Things did pick up somewhat after the interval but I was never fully engaged with the material, especially with the heavy use of psychiatric jargon which was thrown around with plentiful abandon. Perhaps it had more resonance for people who are more familiar with psychoanalysis but I found it ultimately quite alienating: the continual overanalysing of every emotional or indeed emotionless response left me glancing at the watch more than once. Clearly there’s a point here about the capacity of psychoanalysts to actually deal with their own problems, despite the fact that they help others all the time, but sadly it was not one that hooked me in. The acting was predictably first-rate regardless: I suspect Clare Higgins couldn’t be bad if she tried, her portrayal is so subtly measured here and her eventual realisations of the truth of her relations with her children, both of whom she had treated as patients, were especially tragic. Waites’ embittered daughter was superbly bitter and as good a job as could be managed with such an astringent character, but I really enjoyed Nicola Walker’s performance as her character insinuated herself into the role of surrogate daughter."
1417,1417,Ought To Be Clowns,07/02/2015,Ian,Constellations, Samuel J Friedman Theatre,"Fortunately they more than meet the challenge, offering up performances that simultaneously echo their predecessors whilst also finding something new, neatly reflecting the multiverse theory that underpins Payne’s writing here. On paper it might seem terribly scientific – “at any given moment, several outcomes can co-exist simultaneously” – but in reality, it is ineffably, unbearably human in the gorgeous contours of Michael Longhurst’s finely tuned production as scenes play and then instantly replay, shifting subtly but crucially each time with the story of Marianne and Roland’s relationship. What might seem like a rehearsal room exercise in lesser hands – repeating the same lines but in a variety of readings – becomes loaded with the weight of possibility as each incarnation is as persuasively real as the next. Wilson’s scientist and Gyllenhaal’s beekeeper capture perfectly the fallibility of human interaction, their quirky chemistry undeniable even as the theoretical physics works against them, and watching them work their way through the multiple stages of their love affair, and all of the variations inbetween, is to be in the presence of something close to theatrical perfection."
1418,1418,Ought To Be Clowns,20/10/2016,mag9l,A Pacifist’s Guide To The War On Cancer, National,"A musical about cancer? As unlikely as it might seem, A Pacifist’s Guide To The War On Cancer isn’t even the first one that I’ve seen. That dubious honour goes to Happy Ending, one of the most misjudged shows I saw last year, but fortunately this Complicite and National Theatre co-production in association with HOME Manchester rejoices in a much stronger pedigree, a collaboration between performance artist Bryony Kimmings (book and lyrics), Brian Lobel (book) and Tom Parkinson (music). A Pacifist’s Guide… posits itself as “an all-singing, all-dancing celebration of ordinary life and death” and this it does by collating varying stories of people diagnosed with cancer into a single hospital waiting room, watched over by Emma, a single mother waiting for some tests or suspected bone cancer to be conducted on her baby son. And over the course of a long night, we hear their tales of living with the disease, the trials of having to deal with other people’s reactions to it, the wells of emotion it taps into. In that respect, musical theatre as a storytelling form seems better suited than one might think and as someone who in her own words is “not a huge fan of most musicals”, Kimmings, along with Lobel and Parkinson, give us a fascinating exploration of what it can achieve. On receiving a terminal diagnosis, one patient retreats into a 70s funk fantasy number; in a moment of real black comedy, a cancerous mass sings about how it metastasises. There’s a real understanding of the power of music too, from a heartfelt ballad with simple but beautiful harmonies to the whoomph of an epic chorus complete with dance routine to close your first act. It’s a challenging watch, and rightfully so. As a voice inserted into the narrative, Kimmings explains how she wants to encourage a greater openness in society about discussing illness and death and as we move into the second half, more of her typical approach bleeds into the work. The source of these stories manifests itself and all our relationships – as writer, as company members, as the audience – to cancer are brought to the forefront in a tender, but still searching manner. Lucy Osborne’s design perfectly evokes institutional greyness, with its multiple doors marked exit hiding any number of unpleasant surprises; Marc Tritschler’s musical direction copes expertly with the wide range of influences that permeate Parkinson’s score; and in a committed cast that feels like a truly supportive ensemble, Naana Agyei-Ampadu, Gary Wood, and particularly Golda Rosheuvel stand out. “How do we talk about illness and death more?” – you could do a hell of a lot worse than seeing this show and really listening to what it has to say."
1419,1419,Ought To Be Clowns,07/02/2015,Ian,If/Then, Richard Rodgers Theatre,"I couldn’t do New York without taking the opportunity to see Idina Menzel and in lieu of battling the crowds at Times Square, tickets were booked for her starring role in Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey’s If/Then. Having had the soundtrack for a wee while now, and being a big fan thereof, I pretty much knew what I was letting myself in for, meaning there was none of the apparent confusion that blighted much of the initial critical response which found the show hard to follow. Is it confusing? I don’t think so. It’s tricksy yes, as a twin set of narratives follow two different paths that newly-divorced Elizabeth could take as she moves to New York City to start her life anew. Pushing 40, she feels the clock ticking both personally and professionally and so as Liz it is the former that takes precedent and as Beth, the latter. The same friends and colleagues appear in each strand too, with different experiences so you do have to pay some attention but that’s no real hardship. With actors like LaChanze and Jenn Colella, James Snyder and Anthony Rapp, both the worlds that surround Elizabeth are richly portrayed and I particularly loved that in an LGBT-heavy show, it is the L and B that get the spotlight for once, LaChanze particularly stood out for me as Kate, the lesbian schoolteacher who develops beautifully in both strands. And my personal favourite song, ‘Here I Go’, matched all my expectations with the impossibly handsome Snyder duetting gorgeously with Menzel."
1420,1420,Ought To Be Clowns,16/01/2013,Ian,The Silence of the Sea, Donmar at Trafalgar Studios 2,"The final entry in the final year of the Resident Assistant Director programme which has seen the Donmar Warehouse periodically take over Trafalgar Studios 2 is The Silence of the Sea, directed by Simon Evans. Anthony Weigh has fashioned a new theatrical version of this story which was written pseudonymically by Vercors in 1942 as it spoke of the French resistance to the Nazi occupation. Or rather, it tells of the silence with which a man and woman greet the German officer who is billeted to their small coastal cottage and the challenges faced not only by them but also by the interloper, who is not all at first seems. The predominance of silence is both illuminating and challenging. Leo Bill’s natural gift of spectacular oration is superbly highlighted as German officer Werner, delivering several lengthy speeches which delve deep into the increasingly troubled psyche of a man not necessarily convinced of the legitimacy of his country’s actions. From the patronising swagger of his arrival to the anguished reflexive defence of his countrymen, he is frequently mesmerising as he tries to fill the awkward void. Intersecting but not interacting with him, Finbar Lynch’s Older Man also gives us his take on the action, a more conversational account of life under Occupation which one which soon ramps up in intensity. And then there’s Simona Bitmaté’s Young Woman. Near-wordless throughout, her silence and stillness is just as heart-rendingly articulate as the men’s verbosity and maybe even more affecting in what ends up being unsaid. Weigh’s version has a certain poetic quality which frequently ladens the monologues with vivid imagery but ultimately it is Gregory Clarke’s sound design that speaks the loudest from offstage, creating whole worlds of fear and the unknown from which our characters retreat into their silent husks."
1421,1421,Ought To Be Clowns,31/10/2017,Ian,The Exorcist, Phoenix,"Sean Mathias’ production of The Exorcist has resurfaced in the West End just in time for Hallowe’en in the hope of recreating the chills and thrills of the 1973 movie, despite the fact that it is notoriously difficult to get horror right in the theatre. We saw a preview and there may have been wine involved, hence the gif mood-board presented here rather than your fully-fleshed review. So… See Jenny Seagrove in a collection of saucily modern outfits Appreciate Adam Garcia’s Father Damien in his boxing scenes Wonder whether a pre-recorded Ian McKellen is really the best fit for the demon Marvel at how Ben Hart’s illusions recreate many of the iconic moments from the film… But wonder too at how the biggest effect is achieved right at the start with barely any effort at all And for the love of God, don’t buy tickets at the front and on the sides! Don’t take your kids – there’s a (perhaps overly cautious) 18+ age guidance note And do as we did and take advantage of the late night show (9pm start) on a Friday, which allows enough time to get sufficiently warmed up… …and you might well have a screamer of a time In all honesty, it really ain’t that scary, something so ingrained in the cultural memory could scarcely hope to continue to shock. But in its best moments, The Exorcist is high camp and thus gloriously, enjoyably silly. Plus it will most likely make you jump one way or another."
1422,1422,Ought To Be Clowns,10/09/2012,Ian,Three Sisters, Young Vic,"Back when the Young Vic announced their forthcoming shows as being A Doll’s House and Three Sisters, I was a little surprised at how safe the programming seemed, on the surface at least. For as it turned out, Ibsen was revitalised by Simon Stephens to stunning effect in one of the shows of the year so far and so expectations were high for Chekhov’s turn, adapted and directed by Benedict Andrews, the Australian auteur whose Cate Blanchett-starring Big and Small proved to be somewhat divisive. And this production, set in an abstract modern day, also seems set to provoke strong opinion. From Helen Rappaport’s literal translation, Andrews has thoroughly modernised the language of this story of three young women trapped in a stultifying provincial Russian town, dreaming of heady love affairs and escaping to the Moscow of their childhoods yet unable to fully wrest control of their lives from the cruel twists of fate. But dislocating the play from the social and economic context in which Chekhov conceived it seriously undermines a central aspect of the drama.  At the turn of the twentieth century, the socio-economic opportunities open to women in Russian society were clearly limited, hence this portrait of the oppressiveness of small-town life proving so durable, but in this world where the sing-songs around the piano are to Nirvana’s ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’, people are taking pictures on their iPhones and playing with remote-controlled helicopters,  and the sisters hum Leonard Cohen and David Bowie to each other, it is hard to really feel the sense of constraint that is apparently binding them there. This is a world where the choices open to them are far greater and so their conflicts seem much less compellingly final, whether the inability to get to Moscow, to escape their detested sister-in-law or to simply divorce a dull husband. Matters are not helped by the strength of Andrews’ directorial vision which largely serves to impose visually arresting but dramatically redundant tableaux on the production. Flowers are melodramatically strewn about to be swept up straightaway, a multitude of candles are lit off to the side to be simply extinguished where they are, the deconstruction of Johannes Schütz’s jigsaw-of-tables set in Act 3 is a portentous over-extended metaphor which doesn’t really work in the grand scheme of things. Consequently, the staging and the text don’t always seem to work together, the new interpretation not feeling quite right in its skin and leaving the sense that Andrews doesn’t have the confidence to let the play speak for itself. It is undoubtedly well-acted: Mariah Gale’s eldest Olga already washed out by life, Vanessa Kirby’s rock-chick-like Masha a sharply comic presence despite her disillusionment with her marriage and Gala Gordon, in an impressive debut performance, growing in maturity to finally be able to assert what she needs to do as the play reaches its climax. Emily Barclay was my favourite performer though, this Australian actress seizing every opportunity to steal scenes as Natasha, rising from the village girl they all mock to their outrageously brash sister-in-law. Of the men, William Houston’s swaggering Vershinin and Adrian Schiller’s tolerantly bookish Kulygin do well, with Michael Feast epitomising Chekhovian despondency as the troubled Chebutykin. But across the wide open thrust stage and along the three hours of the running time, the company struggle to engage and compel with each other and with the story, and thus it emerges as less than essential. Andrews’ vision clearly aspires to the epic and never shies away from being controversial, which isn’t a problem in itself, but when it is predicated on such a misconceived premise as the updating here, it makes for a rather trying experience. A very well written and illuminating review."
1423,1423,Ought To Be Clowns,12/02/2018,Ian,Again, Trafalgar Studios 2,"Most families have a story or three, the kind of tales that go down in folklore, destined to be repeated at family events no matter embarrassing for the parent/sibling/etc involved. I doubt many will have as good an anecdote as the Barcelona suitcase story which crops up midway through Again, making its world premiere at the Trafalgar Studios 2 in this Mongrel Thumb production. The ways in which families tell and retell stories, communicating or struggling to communicate to each other, lies at the heart of what writer Stephanie Jacob is trying to achieve here. Married to a playful theatrical structure that emphasises how tricky saying the right thing can be (or unsaying the wrong thing…) but also which allows for infinite possibility, Again makes for an intermittently striking evening.  This particular family, as more and more these days do, have become estranged. Some time ago, Tom abandoned Louise for a younger woman and has started a new family, leaving their two children to get on with emotionally diverse consequences. Poetry lecturer Adam is hyper-reserved and looking at moving back in with mum and the disorganised Izzy is frantically unreliable. Brought together under the same roof for the first time in quite some time, what is there left to say? Hannah Price’s production plays out in the clean lines of Anthony Lamble’s smart design and she ensures that her cast cultivate a real sense of shared history. The luminous Natasha Little is superb as Louise, a woman still ascertaining her role in life now she’s no longer a wife, now her kids are grown-up, and pleasingly nuanced in how complicated her relationship with Chris Larkin’s Tom remains, a soul who recognises what he has left behind whilst not quite regretting it. As the perma-kids, Rosie Day and Charles Reston both acquit themselves well, amusingly petulant in that way that only being with family can bring out of you. And it is their responses to the nature of the narrative that really shine through, though there’s no doubting that the structure (a little bit Nick Payne, a little bit Caryl Churchill) carries with it a challenge which Sally Ferguson’s lighting could afford to better illuminate by being a little bolder. Running time: 75 minutes (without interval)

1424,1424,Ought To Be Clowns,08/05/2017,Ian,A Lie of the Mind, Southwark Playhouse,"Despite being blown away by True West, something about Sam Shepard makes me a little wary. I liked rather than loved Fool For Love and ultimately steered clear of the recent Buried Child and it was with a little trepidation that I allowed myself to make my way into A Lie of the Mind, produced here at the Southwark Playhouse by the folks at Defibrillator Theatre. Part of the problem I think lies in my antipathy towards the American dream as a narrative driver, in all honesty I often find I could care less about characters who are constructed around it. So a production has to do a lot to create the kind of context that makes me care and I’d say that director James Hillier just about manages it here, albeit with a couple of reservations. In rural Montana, a part of the declining American West, the fallout from a particularly vicious episode of the brutally abusive marriage between Jake and Beth plays out. He’s retreated back to his childhood bedroom and she is recovering from her substantial injuries at her family’s cabin and in parallel, we track – through the most abstracted of ways – the dysfunctional family bonds, their violent legacies and the crucially unexpressed love, that have led them to this point and which appear to offer little alternative beyond."
1425,1425,Ought To Be Clowns,05/03/2015,mag9l,Antigone, Barbican,"After the huge success of A View From The Bridge (now successfully transferred into the West End), there’s no doubting that Belgian director Ivo van Hove has been sucked into the mainstream consciousness of British theatregoers, hence this sold out run of Antigone at the Barbican. The presence of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche probably helped in that regard but there’s clearly no dimming in the sense of ambition here as this pan-European work, produced by…(deep breath)…the Barbican and Les Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg, in association with Toneelgroep Amsterdam, and co-produced by Théâtre de la Ville-Paris, Ruhrfestspiele Recklinghausen and Edinburgh International Festival, launches an eight month tour across Europe and the USA. So it’s now the turn of Greek tragedy to get the van Hove treatment, Sophokles’ play has received a new translation here by Canadian poet and classicist Anne Carson which instantly elevates the work into a realm of heightened theatricality as the coils of its language wind elegantly around the ongoing troubles of this royal family. In the aftermath of a civil war in which the sons of Oidipous, Eteokles and Polyneikes, have killed each other fighting over the right to rule Thebes, it is Kreon – the brother of his wife (and mother) Jocasta – who takes the throne. Grieving for the loss of his own son, Kreon institutes a newly authoritarian rule, one which declares Polyneikes a traitor and thus unable to receive burial rites and this incenses Oidipous’ daughter Antigone and the pursuit of honouring her brother puts them in direct conflict. For all its loftier philosophical musings about the role of the state, the possibilities of a higher law and the ethics of civil disobedience, this Antigone finds its power in the personal, in the terrible intimacy of people not being able to grieve for their loved ones in the manner to which they are accustomed. The death of nearly 200 Dutch people in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in the Ukraine resonated strongly with van Hove, indeed directly affecting his Toneelgroep company, and there’s something of both the raw anger in Binoche’s performance of the anguished Antigone, but also the determination to do ‘the right thing’, to reclaim dignity and respect in the face of death. The melodiousness of Binoche’s voice is beautifully weighted by the depth of her sorrow and she revels in the intensity here, daring anyone, everyone, to look away from her unfaltering gaze. Something van Hove excels in is his acute sense of spatial onstage geography, the positioning of each actor is crucially pin-sharp and often says as much about the relationships between the characters than their words – this is particularly true of the always-present Chorus here. See how arrange themselves to listen to Patrick O’Kane’s Kreon speak of his new rule of law and contrast it with where they end up once Tiresias arrives to rain doom them all (and whether deliberate or not, I loved the call-out to this iconic reaction shot). Likewise, the fierce emotion of the interactions of Kreon and his son Haimon (an excellent Samuel Edward-Cook) and of Antigone and her sister Ismene (a beautifully poised Kirsty Bushell) finds elegant echoes rippling through the fabric of the show, reiterating the enduring power of the family bond even under extreme duress. Long-time collaborator Jan Versweyveld takes on designing duties for set and lighting once again and creates some gorgeous tableaux – the windswept vista of the opening scene, the haunting bird’s-eye view into the tomb, the stark simplicity of the celestial circle of light that dominates the set – it all looks sensational. Daniel Freitag’s sound design murmurs and bubbles under with a slowly building sense of ominous foreboding and there’s fascinating video work from Tal Yarden which is at its best when filling the back wall with an amorphous mass of barely-discernible figures, a haunting suggestion of the city where they all live. When it comes into focus though, the desert landscape where Polyneikes’ body lies and the modern metropolitan hustle and bustle of Thebes (soundtracked to The Velvet Underground’s ‘Heroin’) itself felt
distractingly contradictory.  So perhaps not the epic experience of A View From The Bridge or Maria Stuart, or the sheer audacity of Scenes From A Marriage or The Roman Tragedies but Ivo van Hove at 95% is still one of the best nights you can ask for in a theatre. With Binoche in such fine form – the moment when she skipped to the front of the stage and perched on the edge just mere metres away from me was heart-stoppingly brilliant (and mostly made up for the fact that the front row should probably be labelled restricted view) – and a fiercely committed company around her (Finbar Lynch, an elegiac Kathryn Pogson and a beautifully spoken Obi Abili complete the ensemble), this is powerful stuff indeed. It may be being filmed by broadcast soon but it is worth stalking the Barbican website for returns and experiencing this exquisite agony in person."
1426,1426,Ought To Be Clowns,19/02/2015,mag9l,,,"A half-term jaunt down to London for Aunty Jean saw us take in a couple of shows I was happy to revisit. I remain as affectionately inclined towards Dirty Rotten Scoundrels as I ever have done, its traditional bonhomie remains as watchable as ever and there’s just something comfortable about the whole affair which remains hard to resist. Even whilst not being Robert Lindsay’s biggest fan (seriously, is he being paid by the pelvic thrust?!) the shimmering star quality of Kat Kingsley and the affable appeal of Alex Gaumond more than compensate. And the bumbling charms of Ben Fox, the third Chief of Police since the show started – job security in Beaumont-Sur-Mer is clearly not strong 😉 – prove the ideal foil for Bonnie Langford’s knowingly charismatic Muriel."
1427,1427,Ought To Be Clowns,19/05/2014,mag9l,In The Heights, Southwark Playhouse,"Amid the crashing and burning of ill-conceived big budget West End shows, it has been left to the smaller venues of London to carry the torch for musical theatre in the capital and currently leading the charge with what will surely end up being one of the productions of the year is the Southwark Playhouse. They secured the UK premiere of Tony winning show In The Heights which in itself is an achievement but more importantly, they assembled a team who have expertly reconceived it for the relatively intimate space to create some explosively exciting theatre. Luke Sheppard’s production is pitch-perfect on every level. The choreography – Drew McOnie deserves every prize going – is fearless, fast and furious, Latin influences married with contemporary movement to create something that feels incredibly organic in its fluidity; Howard Hudson’s lighting is full of vibrant splashes of colour and well evokes the near-unbearable heat; and takis’ set design maximises the space brilliantly, suggesting the communal spirit and run-down feel of a hard-done-by enclave yet also finding room for a band of 8 along with a cast of 17. Set in the blistering temperatures of a 3 day heat-wave in the New York Hispanic community of Washington Heights, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s music and lyrics integrates modern music styles into the world of theatre with powerfully effective results. Latin rhythms rub up against hip-hop rhymes, salsa flavour slow-grinds on silkily soulful beats, it’s a headily seductive mixture indeed and one which subsumes us entirely into this culture, locates us strongly in a world where the protection of community and the celebration of heritage is key. And that is the crucial point of Quiara Alegría Hudes’ book for me, this evocation of community spirit is more important than any of the individual stories that are told, which aren’t perhaps as strongly defined as those who expect conventional narrative devices might desire. The show is never stronger than midway through the second half as the glorious flag-waving spirit of Carnaval del Barrio transmutes into the heart-rending power of Alabanza, tears of joy swiftly turning into those of sorrow, but all the while there’s a sense of togetherness about what it is these people are feeling. Across a large ensemble who deliver to an exceptionally high standard, there are stand-out performances. Sam Mackay as the central Usnavi is just superb, his lyrical dexterity a pleasure to get lost in and he brings a wonderful warmth to the character. Victoria Hamilton-Barritt makes herself a dead cert for ‘Sofía Vergara the musical’ with a hilariously scene-stealing turn as salon owner Daniela, Emma Kingston’s Vanessa and Christina Modestou’s Nina brings different strengths to their determined women and Damian Buhagiar makes an extraordinary debut as the naïve but street-smart Sonny. In the Heights is that rare thing, a show that really has no equal in London at the moment, not least for its strikingly contemporary approach (oh how I long for something similar to spring out of somewhere like South London) but also for the sheer integrity of every aspect of the production. Multi-million pound budgets are all very well but it is how they are utilised that is the key and with a fraction of the resources, this show demonstrates just how much can be achieved in creating one of the shows of the year. “Seguirás en mis recuerdos para siempre”. "
1428,1428,Ought To Be Clowns,12/08/2017,Ian,Bodies, Royal Court,"Between this and Yerma, theatreland would have us firmly believe that to be a childless woman in her 30s, or rather a woman wanting a child, is to be on the precipice of madness. I have liked, nay loved, much of Vivienne Franzmann’s work (Mogadishu, The Witness, Pests) but with Bodies, her sure touch in delving into the trickier aspects of human nature doesn’t quite feel as insightful. Clem has tried several times to carry a child to term but sadly miscarried on every occasion and so, with husband Josh, has turned to surrogacy. Finding the right, white Russian egg donor and the perfect Indian surrogate womb does not come cheap and as Franzmann explores, it is a cost that is as much moral and emotional as it is financial – the ethics of this ‘business’ murky indeed. Jude Christian’s production cycles round these key players, also throwing in Clem’s father David who is dying of Motor Neurone Disease, in Gabriella Slade’s elegant set, from which spouts a whole raft of challenging ideas. An unreconstructed socialist, David is severely disapproving of his daughter’s plans and their scenes debating whether this extent to which this whole process is exploitative are most powerful. It’s a discussion which is continued inventively by Franzmann by having Justine Mitchell’s excellent Clem interact with an imaginary version of her daughter (an impressive Hannah Rae), parsing all of the arguments for and against. Less successful is the representation of Third World womanhood in the form of Lakshmi, the creeping horror of the slow reveal of her circumstances undermined by a regressive choice in the writing."
1429,1429,Ought To Be Clowns,20/10/2012,Ian,The River, Royal Court,"Despite being prepared for all kinds of brouhaha with the specially instituted booking system for The River, Jez Butterworth’s new play upstairs at the Royal Court – tickets only available on the day of performance, 30 in person and the rest online – when it came to it, I only had to refresh the website twice at 9am to get my tickets (I recommend logging into your account first) so hopefully, it may be less of a trial than might be currently considered. Butterworth’s last play here was the behemoth that became Jerusalem (and yes, I am one of the few people that wasn’t much of a fan…) but I did enjoy his more intimate Parlour Song for the Almeida and so expectations were at a nicely manageable level. Which is always a good place to be, especially when it enables one to fully appreciate a play free from too much baggage. For The River is a piece of gorgeously sensitive writing, utterly beguiling in its subtle deconstruction of the way we conduct ourselves in relationships -the facades erected, the lies told, the declarations made, the pasts conveniently ignored. An introspective look at what it means to be intimate with someone and the importance of honesty in conjunction with that, it combines the highly naturalistic world realised by Ultz with the almost magical, poetic language of Butterworth which swims with unknowing purpose, occasionally catching the light beautifully like the sea trout in the story, negotiating the swells of the river back to its spawning ground.    Ian Rickson teases deliciously drawn performances from all of his cast. Dominic West has probably never been better as a deeply assured portrayal of modern masculinity, an easily bruised ego sitting easily alongside secure emotional honesty, yet all encaptured in a veil of uncertain mystery that is enthralling to watch. Miranda Raison exudes sensuality with a striking self-confidence but an almost self-flagellating directness and Laura Donnelly brings an alternative take, all intriguing allure and keen perceptiveness as Butterworth guides us through the ebbs and flows of the journey, though the water is never quite clear enough to see easily to the bottom. A vein of rich humour keeps the mood often playful, yet never sacrificing the carefully constructed atmosphere of fluid intrigue that characterises so much of this production – there’s a reason this review is relatively non-specific on details… On a more frivolous level, there are all sorts of details that would get the West End Whingers into quite a tizzle. Food preparation is taken to new levels (although I would have rinsed the leeks myself) and those of a squeamish nature might want to avert their eyes at one particular piscine moment and there’s a great switcheroo later on, though I hope resource management is ensuring nothing goes to waste. Ultimately it is hard to credit exactly why the Royal Court have gone the route they did with The River. It has ensured an extra level of publicity for a show that doesn’t need it at all, no show upstairs here ever has problems selling, never mind one as eagerly anticipated as this. And attempting to justify it as needing to be in this particular theatre doesn’t work either, as the staging is relatively traditional and could easily fit in downstairs (in a way that say, Constellations and The Witness really played with the space). I was lucky that my booking experience was extremely painless so there wasn’t too much to live up to in that respect, but I do wonder if the woman who started queuing at 6.30am came away thinking it was worth it. I hope so, because The River is a play of luminous beauty, hauntingly affecting in its intimate surroundings and certainly worthy of (at least some of) the additional efforts necessary to secure a ticket. Interesting review, really makes me want to see it. But living out of London makes dayseating hard and I don't think it will be as easy to get to the tickets on the website once the reviews are in the paper.Maybe it will transfer Can't see it transferring – West is in My Fair Lady over the winter and Raison is bound to be busy too. But maybe it will go into the West End like Constellations did eventually, it would probably sell well, if they drop the silly system."
1430,1430,Ought To Be Clowns,22/08/2013,Ian,The Sound of Music, Open Air Theatre,"Despite never having seen it on the stage before, I hadn’t originally intended to go and see the Open Air Theatre’s production of The Sound of Music. But whilst on holiday, we watched the film on TV en famille whereupon I was reminded of its charms and hearing the good reviews of this production, duly set about booking tickets for an evening when I hoped the sun would shine. And I clearly had some good theatrical karma as a glorious summer’s evening set up what a simply delightful evening of old school musical entertainment. It may not be the most adventurous of programming choices and Rachel Kavanaugh’s production plays a very straight bat but in many ways, this is why it is so successful. Its straightforward simplicity allows for a direct emotional hit, one which plays off the indubitable familiarity of so much of the material but also the opportunities offered by this open air venue and the freshness of a supremely talented cast. Charlotte Wakefield’s Maria and Michael Xavier’s Captain may initially seem more youthful than one might expect but together they work like a dream, combining with the whole company to create the kind of warmth that would brighten even the soggiest of September evenings (the run has extended by a week due to its success). Wakefield brims with vitality from the moment she appears at the back of the seating to sing the title song, her vocal confidence is superb and there’s enough briskness in her manner to prevent any sense of cloying mawkishness. Three teams of kids rotate as the mini von Trapps and our set were especially delightful, Imogen Gurney’s precocious Brigitta particularly good and Sarah Huttlestone cute as a button as Gretl. And Xavier’s bearded handsomeness is perfect for the Captain, whose emotional intransigence Maria slowly breaks through, encouraging him to rediscover both his love for music in the show’s most moving moment, and the joys of paddling."
1431,1431,Ought To Be Clowns,12/11/2014,Ian,The Piano Man, New Diorama,"You may or may not remember the case of The Piano Man, a dishevelled gentleman found washed up on the Kent coast who for four months was utterly silent, baffling those trying to help him rediscover who he was and what had happened to him. Opting to examine this story and to devise an original piece of theatre out of it, AllthePigs reflect and refract the events through a contemporary prism, finding their own route into the strange world of Andreas Grassl as he eventually turned out to be. Delving back into his recent personal history to suggest the impact a traumatic split with his boyfriend might have had on his emotional health, exploring the differing ways that the press and the medical establishment treated him whilst nothing was known, going off at a tangent to hear current thinking on how the brain works in relation to memory and identity, they come at the tale from all angles. Director Sam Carrack has done an excellent job in working the devised nature of the show into something more organically fluid, providing connective tissue for the constituent parts. Angelo Paragoso’s expressive movement work has a powerful impact when it pulls the whole company together to evoke feelings of helplessness and loss of control, but it is equally compelling when depicting the intimacy between Andreas and his lover. A neat parallel is drawn between being blinded with a surfeit of scientific terminology in a lecture about the brain and being overwhelmed by medical professionals all keen to solve the latest mystery. And scattered as these segments are, they rarely feel disjointed due to these criss-crossing links which bind them into an often beguiling piece of theatre which possesses a gentle but insistent power, even when it converses in German."
1432,1432,Ought To Be Clowns,08/02/2010,Ian,Knives in Hens, Arcola,"Rather amusingly, Hackney Council’s newsletter refers to this play as Hens with Knives, a completely different Orwellian prospect, one wonders, and a possible new commission for someone! Knives in Hens as this play is more commonly known, was my first experience in the studio space at the rear of the Arcola, and an interesting one it is too. The first play written by David Harrower, who had success with his most recent play Blackbird, this is a look at the role of language in intellectual awakening. An uneducated young woman, trapped by marriage in a closed and superstitious community, develops an intense relationship with the village outcast, a miller. He reads and writes and so is distrusted by the villagers, but offers the woman a route to her own intellectual and sexual awakening, away from the life to which she is accustomed. Jodie McNee’s Woman is nicely portrayed, sensitively showing the potential aroused in her by the new connection in her life: her increasing ability to name things, setting herself free and open to what she might become is a nice judged journey. As the agent of change in her life, Phil Cheadle’s handsome miller is laden with enigmatic temptation and Nathaniel Martello-White (recently impressive in Innocence at the same theatre) as her unyielding husband was also good. In the intimate gravel-covered space, 3 wooden pillars evoke the rural setting of the play but are also cleverly to suggest a series of locations and doorways . The action is accompanied by live cello music performed by Maria Grico. Initially this proved quite atmospheric, but as we got into the action, I actually found it to be intrusive, especially when it was playing over the talking, the language is powerful and interesting enough without it."
1433,1433,Ought To Be Clowns,12/06/2017,Ian,Anatomy of a Suicide, Royal Court,"Beautiful yet undeniably brutal, Anatomy of a Suicide has all the shimmering disquiet of a half-remembered dream, a blurred imagining of people, places and things that coalesce into something deeply profound. Constructed by playwright Alice Birch and director Katie Mitchell, it revels in a hugely exciting formal inventiveness (even the playtext is stunning to look at) but is also filled with a repressed emotionality that is often bruising to watch. The play contains three narrative strands, set in different times, which are performed simultaneously on the same stage. Across the decades from the 1970s to the 2030s, the lives of Carol, Anna and Bonnie play out with strange echoes and motifs recurring until we realise how interconnected they are. Anna is Carol’s daughter, Bonnie is Anna’s and it is more than blood that they share, Birch suggests a shared legacy of severe depression. It’s an uncomfortable (depressing, even) premise but one which pays rich dividends as it provokes in us something primal, something elemental about the truths and conventions we cling onto. The thought that motherhood isn’t always considered a blessing but a trial, the idea that we can easily outrun familial legacies, the notion that what is so, so good for ourselves isn’t necessarily so great for another. As words and actions trickle down through the ages, reverberating back again, shaping and reshaping these lives, something vastly moving occurs."
1434,1434,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2011,Ian,Accolade, Finborough,"Accolade, a 1950 play by Emlyn Williams, is receiving its first ever revival here at the Finborough as part of their RediscoveriesUK season. Considered a controversial play at the time due to its unashamedly frank approach to sexuality, it will hardly seem risqué to modern audiences but as it is a rather tightly-constructed drama filled with suspense and given an excellent production here with Blanche McIntyre directing, one can’t help but wonder how on earth it has taken so long to get this back on the stage! Set in London in 1950, Will Trenting is a novelist who has received notification that he is to be knighted and fully embraced into respectable society. But his scandalous novels have been born out of the double life that he has been leading and the attention that comes with this accolade being awarded to him exposes his predilection for drunken orgies in the East End with partners of all ages. Just before his date with Buckingham Palace though, a shocking charge is made and the fallout threatens his carefully balanced mix of family life and wilful hedonism. In its defence of an unapologetic sexually promiscuous way of life, the play is a thinly veiled appeal for tolerance of alternative lifestyles, Williams was openly bisexual and clearly took inspiration from his own life for the play, but it also feels so incredibly current in the way that it indicts a society that is far too keen to rake over the private lives of anyone thrust into the public eye. One was reminded of the shameful treatment of the female football umpire whose holiday pics were recently splashed on the tabloid front pages despite her not being the main focus of the issue in hand. Aden Gillett is excellent in the central role with what is almost two different characters, managing to build convincing relationships in both of his worlds and suggesting the inner torment as they eventually clash. Saskia Wickham’s quietly tolerant wife played the emotional restraint beautifully and Patrick Osborne’s bookish and comically geeky son completed a cohesive family unit. Williams pushes his point a little too hard though at the expense of credibility, especially in Trenting’s familial relations: the sainted wife who accepts his dual life as her lot is a little too good to be true and in the face of possible imprisonment, it would have been nice to see him display more remorse towards being parted from his son. Simon Darwen and Olivia Darnley brought a real grounded humanity to their East-end couple, seemingly a world away from the Trentings’ world, but such warm, well-rounded characters that they were utterly believable as the reliable friends that they come to be. Alan Francis was strong as the ever-faithful and ever-resourceful butler, Emma Jerrold a vivacious ginger-haired friend and Graham Seed brought a creepy, lip-licking shiftiness to his would-be blackmailer. James Cotterill’s design, creating the book-lined study that the whole play takes place in, is very well-realised and enhanced by Neill Brinkworth’s lighting. I wasn’t entirely convinced of the need to push some of the seating into the round around the edge of the auditorium and I think I’d advise sitting forward of the sofa. But in an interesting play with its timeless relevance combined with a vibrant production which has been excellently cast, the Finborough have revived a winner here: book now, this will surely sell out quickly."
1435,1435,Ought To Be Clowns,26/01/2019,Ian,Thomas, VAULT Festival,"Robbie Curran’s debut play Thomas is a gently lovely little thing which quietly does more to represent neurodiverse voices than you could ever imagine. Thomas and David are cousins, Thomas has Asperger’s but even if David doesn’t, he’s not immune to the pressures that can overwhelm young men in contemporary society. Curran takes us through their journey into those men and the ways in which their condition(s) shape it, or otherwise as the case may be. Curran plays Thomas and he shares an extraordinary chemistry with Ben Lydon’s David, brothers by any other name as childhood games turn into teenage rebellions and then altogether more adult pleasures. As with the under-rated Jellyfish, there’s such mileage in showing the fullness of neurodiverse lives and Thomas‘ standout scene comes with David’s disbelief at his cousin’s particular success at a house party. Throw in a cracking scene of getting stoned and another in which he tries to parse the orgasm scene in When Harry Met Sally, and Curran’s talents as a writer are clear to see. At the same time, there are the odd moments where a little work might be usefully employed. The breaking of the fourth wall in the first scene is a brilliant disruption but it is one which isn’t really exploited to its full potential as the play progresses. And there’s a little too much scene change shenanigans at the expense of delineating when we are in the fractured narrative, an issue when time is at a premium in an hour-long show."
1436,1436,Ought To Be Clowns,24/04/2018,Ian,Strictly Ballroom the Musical, Piccadilly,"It is fascinating to be able to follow the development of a show, particularly one that has morphed as much as Strictly Ballroom the Musical. I saw it at the West Yorkshire Playhouse the winter before last, where it didn’t quite set my world on fire, so I was intrigued to hear that its arrival in the West End at the Piccadilly would be accompanied by quite the overhaul, still directed and choreographed by Drew McOnie. The major change to this adaptation of Baz Luhrmann’s 1992 cult hit movie comes with the introduction of bandleader Wally Strand, played by Will Young, an MC figure and human jukebox who takes on the vast majority of the evening’s singing. And as we skip from Grace Jones to Billy Idol, via Bowie, Whitney and Cyndi, it’s a real pleasure to hear him sing Marius De Vries’ brilliant new arrangements.  But though music is such an intrinsic part of this story of Australian ballroom dancing competitions, and of this production with Ben Atkinson’s accomplished band onstage, there’s no escaping that with Luhrmann and Craig Pearce’s book, this isn’t the strongest of musicals. What it is is a strong piece of musical theatre. McConey may be the director but he’s a choreographer through and through and it is here that Strictly Ballroom shines. His company are unbelievably on point in every single routine they deliver, and there’s plenty of them. And in the showstopping moments – the Latin flair of the Act 1 finale, the various competitions, the striking nightmare ballet – their physicality and precision is beautiful to behold, not least because of the shocking brights of Catherine Martin’s costumes, from the original film natch. But there’s no doubting the thinness of the plotting and crucially, the characterisation of leading man Scott Hastings. As a main protagonist, there’s criminally little to him and Jonathan Labey struggles to flesh him out beyond his considerable dance skills. Zizi Strallen has more joy as Fran, using the ugly duckling hook to inject some real personality but among the conga-line of perma-tanned supporting characters, none are able to truly stand out. Something gets lost in the comedy here, there’s no real heart in the humour, and so it all ends up feeling a little sterile. McOnie does come up with some visually powerful moments though – there’s hints of Follies in the shadowy ballroom figures that haunt the edges of the stages, and in the silhouettes behind the mirrors.  And Howard Hudson’s lighting is brilliantly conceived, highlighting some major dance moves most effectively. To misquote another movie, dance ten, everything else five."
1437,1437,Ought To Be Clowns,27/08/2014,Ian,A Streetcar Named Desire, Young Vic,"As if you could hide the truth about this, surely destined to be one of the shows of the year. Benedict Andrews’ thoughtful updating of Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire makes it seem like the play has always lived in this era and these characters always as freshly vibrant as they are here. The work of Gillian Anderson, Vanessa Kirby and Ben Foster as Blanche, Stella and Stanley is extraordinarily done – the disturbing sheen of sexual violence a tangible and thoroughly believable threat throughout as Andrews pulls no punches in showing us how brutal this world is. There’s no escaping it either as Magda Willi’s framelike design constantly revolves in front of us as we’re sat in the round. This choice works on so many levels – the dizzying descent that characterises Blanche’s downfall, the relentless passage of time, the voyeurism it provokes from the audience as we crane to see what it sometimes hidden from view (just like the passive neighbours in the New Orleans neighbourhood). It’s not always easy or comfortable but given what we’re watching, why the hell should we be?! A punchily modern soundtrack adds to the freshly modern aesthetic but it is the performances that Andrews teases out of his cast that really elevate the production. Kirby makes something almost entirely new out of Stella which is just fantastic, an earthly woman full of sexual need and emotional wants, her seductive presence is a surprise and a success, reinventing the role in an unforgettable manner. And so it is no surprise that Ben Foster’s tattooed ex-con can’t contain himself, brimming with (possibly PTSD-inspired) anger and fury and yes, a raw sexuality."
1438,1438,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2018,Ian,A Streetcar Named Desire, NST City Southampton,"If Blanche DuBois were around today, then of course her go-to tunes would be the likes of Madonna and Blondie, and a glitterball would take the place of her colourful paper lantern. And as the strains of ‘Material Girl’ gets most everyone up and dancing at the end of a fateful poker night, Chelsea Walker’s contemporary take on this Tennessee Williams classic finds its happy place. Of course, it’s A Streetcar Named Desire so that happy place lasts for a moment of seconds before Patrick Knowles’ brutish Stanley reasserts himself. And what Walker’s clever updating does is to not let itself get bogged down in minor textual incongruities, but to firmly locate its troubling sexual dynamics in the gender politics of right now.   In his boardshorts and wifebeater, Knowles makes for a crueller, sharper Stanley, his febrile nature explosively close to the surface. Whether attacking a watermelon with a hunting knife or ensuring Stella’s casual gear is one of his bowling shirts (Amber James movingly lost in a sexual fug), there’s no doubting he and his bros embody a toxic masculinity that is tragic in its widespread acceptance. Against this, Kelly Gough’s Blanche cuts an agonising figure. Her affectations and mannerisms more obviously a protective cocoon, hollowed from the inside out by drink and weakened by the chipping away at a truth that won’t be denied. Dexter Flanders imbues his Mitch with much decency and there’s illustrative work from Maria Louis’ upstairs neighbour Eunice, living out her own fully-fleshed story even if we only get occasional glimpses of it.  "
1439,1439,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2017,Ian,Saint George and the Dragon, National Theatre,"There’s something interesting about a community that can simultaneously urge the need to talk constructively about failure and also gloat endlessly about the its possibility. Where the National Theatre is concerned, the stakes feel considerably heightened and following a summer that contained the divisive Salomé and Common, sadly you could almost feel the knives being sharpened in advance for Saint George and the Dragon. Two contrasting viewpoints from two contrasting people, to be sure, but you wonder how open-minded people are being, particularly when the start to this press night was delayed by 30 minutes or so adding fuel to certain people’s fire. But all this dancing around is doing, is delaying the inevitable, in that I found Rory Mullarkey’s new play really quite tough-going and had it not been for an effortful performance from John Heffernan keeping it afloat from the front, it would have been worse. The Olivier is an unforgiving space and seems to provoke a certain kind of writing that longs to be suitably epic. But whether it is the writers being over-awed or the commissioning process not being rigorous enough, the new writing being showcased here isn’t quite hitting the mark. Mullarkey uses the legendary figure of St George to explore English life and its people, how it and they have changed from medieval history to current Brexited times. This he does by splitting his play into three but populating them with the same people. So Heffernan’s George is first seen as a weary knight who saves the woman he loves from a dragonish baron, inspiring the villagers as he frees them all. He’s called away and upon his return, it is now the Industrial Revolution and the dragon has returned in the form of an invasive capitalism. Heroics are performed once again but on the next return to the modern day, the dragon has seeped into the bones of society itself."
1440,1440,Ought To Be Clowns,16/06/2015,mag9l,hang, Royal Court,"A woman – a mother, a wife, but definitely not a victim. Hell no. Marianne Jean-Baptiste’s enigmatically named Three is a quiet presence at first in debbie tucker green’s self-directed hang. Ushered through the institutionally bland corridors of Jon Bausor’s raised set by two nameless employees (well, they’re called One and Two) of a faceless corporation, she’s there to exact the price of an event past. But as the requisite layers of bureaucracy are peeled back for her decision to be authorised, the cold fury and righteous indignation that has fuelled her for the past couple of years erupts with calculated precision in a stunning performance. We’re in a near-future environment not too different from our own – surveillance has increased and more and more services have been out-sourced, including the punishment system. tucker green initially gives little away but the writing uncoils in unexpected but engaging ways, information slowly drip-dripping from the half-finished sentences like sweat from a politician’s brow on election night. And the rhythm it establishes is astonishing, making detailed use of active silences to speak volumes about the relationships between the characters, the interplay between Jean-Baptiste and Claire Rushbrook’s officer is particularly deliciously charged. But it is in the dark poetry of pain and frustration that hang really nails its colours to the wall. The laser-sharp accuracy with which Three scythes through the anonymised blandness and near-comic futility of the protocols designed to ‘protect’ her is ferocious yet somehow beautiful, a lyrical articulation of lives turned upside down, certainties dissolved and ultimately, the inadequacy of any justice system – no matter how interactive it has become – to provide genuine recompense for such terrible acts. "
1441,1441,Ought To Be Clowns,17/05/2014,mag9l,The Last Five Years, Greenwich Theatre,"First performed a shade over a decade ago, Jason Robert Brown’s The Last Five Years swiftly became a hot favourite when I first heard the score, something confirmed by the first production I saw which featured Julie Atherton elevating herself to goddess status! As a two-hander with little staging needed, it is a popular show to revive, though not necessarily an easy one as a hugely misguided Guildhall production showed. Pleasingly though, this new version avoided such pitfalls to give a brilliant account of this unique love story, albeit with a criminally short run. Co-produced with Greenwich Theatre, As Told By’s new revival played just four shows in Greenwich and will show another three times at the Brighton Fringe next week. Which is fine, but Katie Pesskin’s production is a simply stellar piece of work that deserves a much wider audience, Michael Riley’s musical direction makes the score sound as good as it has ever done and in its performances by Danielle Hope and Jon Robyns, it showcases British musical theatre talent beautifully. Let’s hope there are future plans afoot.  The show explores the five year relationship between up-and-coming novelist Jamie and struggling actress Cathy but cleverly plays with the format so that whilst we hear Jamie’s take on events in chronological order, Cathy’s story is told in reverse, beginning with the heart-breaking end of their marriage, with the two characters only intersecting at one point in the middle – their wedding – their bittersweet closeness marred only by the fact that we already know what it to come. As the one who has to start at the height of the emotional climax, Cathy is much the more difficult of the two roles and whilst my first thought about Danielle Hope was that she was too young for the part, she quickly dispelled any doubts with an absolutely first-rate performance – achingly sad and hugely engaging within minutes, she marries the neurotic edges and continually dashed aspirations of the character with a lovely personable warmth to really nail the frustrating complexity of this woman, never better than in the rueful recognition of the final moments of ‘A Part of That’. And Jon Robyns, who always sounds so effortlessly at home in modern US material, is just excellent as Jamie, the witty writer whose swift career rise threatens everything else in his life, full of cheeky charisma (he brings a swaggering confidence to a great take on ‘The Schmuel Song’) and the kind of easy stage presence that many would kill for, he’s just a dream to watch onstage. Samuel Wyer’s design of a marital bed cracked in two with packing boxes either side suggests just enough about the way things are going and in the roomy Greenwich Theatre, the sound balance was impressively spot on. Riley’s string-heavy band of six sounded excellent throughout, the music arranged perfectly throughout its wide-ranging styles, and Pesskin’s direction kept a clear sense about the opposing timelines, also allowing a few choice moments of almost-crossover to really make some of the emotional beats punch harder. It can be hard to be critical about a show I love but I honestly did think this was a fantastic production which just must come back somehow, it must! "
1442,1442,Ought To Be Clowns,28/04/2015,mag9l,A New Play For The General Election, Finborough,"Well you certainly can’t fault Chris New for finding a new angle amidst the glut of election-themed political theatre that can be found from the Donmar to Theatre Delicatessen. And there’s something fascinating in reading about the way in which A New Play For The General Election was devised over a four week period by New and his cast of four, using guided improvisation to get to a predetermined end point, a brutal “final destination” that spits with real menace. The forty-five minutes leading up to that point don’t always kick with the same force though. Its intentions are clear as the disturbed Danny drags his abducted victim into an abandoned warehouse and commences an obtuse line of questioning which reveals that in fact, this really is George Osborne. Two more people then arrive – the equally troubled Maggie and her tolerant partner Richard – throwing an already turbulent situation into more turmoil."
1443,1443,Ought To Be Clowns,03/10/2015,mag9l,Edward IV, The Wars of the Roses at the Rose Kingston,"Edward IV was my favourite of the three The Wars of the Roses plays, comprising the latter half of 2 Henry VI and an abridged 3 Henry VI. I might be biased towards it as the middle child of the trilogy but it encapsulates much of what is impressive about the whole enterprise. Its heart lies in two of the crucial grand narratives – the epic sweep of Margaret of Anjou’s rise and fall and the arrival on the scene of Richard of Gloucester as he begins the long con that’ll take him so far – and I actually found there to be an exciting sense of pace about the whole play, right up to its cheeky cliff-hangerish ending.  With civil war raging across the country and death and destruction and betrayal and battles round every corner, Henry VI decides to retreat into pacifism leaving Margaret to assume the mantle of leader as her vendetta against Richard of York becomes increasingly vicious as supremacy swings between the two houses. Clad in chainmail, Joely Richardson radiates a malevolent determination that is well-matched by Alexander Hanson’s fervently committed duke, their tussling over the Iron Throne (well this one is stone…) complicated by multiple machinations from supporters constantly defecting from one side to the other.  Waldmann feels more comfortable as the monkish Henry VI here, a plaintive presence to the untimely end and more effective for it, especially when witnessing the devastation of war on regular fathers and sons. The rather random early John Cade interlude offers Rufus Hound an oddly apposite moment to shine as the leader of a short-lived popular revolt, and Oliver Cotton and Laurence Spellman are both excellent as Clifford and his vengeful son, the latter entirely convincing in scorching scenes on the battlefield. And as Hanson’s York realises he’s destined to be the kingmaker rather than king (the Tywin Lannister of the piece if you’re that way inclined), the emergence of his sons as political forces is powerfully done. Kåre Conradi’s bluff confidence suits a rather entitled future Edward IV, Michael Xavier impresses again as the wavering George of Clarence and Robert Sheehan sketches in a fascinating detail to the young Richard of Gloucester, showing how his troubled family interactions (Mum never hugs him, he always feels the butt of the jokes) and prowess with a sword and shield (effective work from fight director Malcolm Ransom) set him on course for achieving the full scope of his twisted ambition whilst somehow suggesting that it might not necessarily have turned out this way."
1444,1444,Ought To Be Clowns,19/01/2012,Ian,Swallows and Amazons, Chichester Festival Theatre,"Originally a big success for the Bristol Old Vic last Christmas, Swallows and Amazons was revived for this festive season and has just spent a month in the West End at the Vaudeville Theatre ahead of an extensive UK tour. Starting off here in Chichester, Arthur Ransome’s 1930 novel has been adapted by Helen Edmunson, sprinkled with songs from The Divine Comedy’s Neil Hannon and directed by Tom Morris, it emerges as a delightfully inventive and highly imaginative production. It works so well because it captures a long-lost spirit of play so very genuinely. From beginning to end, the show exudes a joyous playful spirit that almost immediately makes us forget we’re watching adults pretending to be kids. As the four Walker children set off to set up camp on an uninhabited island near their holiday home, they are whisked into a thrilling adventure beyond their wildest imagination and we are there with them for every beautifully-realised step. Whether its the larks of the ensemble playing the scenes that the children see through their telescope, the hilarity of Roger’s attempts to swim, the bounding fun of the cast stalking each other through the aisles of the theatre, the breathtaking magic of walking the plank or the sheer exuberance that explodes with the delightful audience-involving final skirmish, the warmth with which it all executed means a smile is never far from the face. And there’s something so refreshing about being ensconced in a world where being called a liar is the worst thing imaginable, the combination of innocence and playfulness carefully calibrated to never cloy yet always endear. Stewart Wright as Roger gains most of the laughs, how could he not as the biggest cast member playing the youngest, but he pulls off the innocent child’s simplicity perfectly; Richard Holt and Katie Moore imbue the older John and Susan (are all Susans in children’s literature destined to be sensible?!) with a deft maturity that never loses sight of the fact they are still kids too; and Akiya Henry is just marvellous as Titty – adorable, goofy witty and wise. There’s excellent support across the actor-musician ensemble too, especially from Celia Adams and Sophie Waller as the strident, fine-voiced Amazons and from the incredibly hard-working and energetic Neal Craig who is responsible for some of the funniest moments of the first half. Sound effects and incidental music come from the cast too from a range of sources that evokes Propeller in its inventiveness and consequently the soundscape as a whole is wondrous. The music is folk-inflected and gentle rather than being forthright – this is a play with songs after all – but it fits into the aesthetic extremely well, under Jon Trenchard’s staff musical direction. This is the perfect show to take a child too, even if it is just your inner child. A warm and generous piece of escapist entertainment that is extremely accomplished and well worth it, so go along and bask in the retro glow of a time gone by when everything was just much less complicated."
1445,1445,Ought To Be Clowns,01/11/2014,Ian,Dad Dancing, Battersea Arts Centre,"Do you dread the moment your dad gets up on the dancefloor, or do you celebrate the time being spent together? Do you cringe at the moves he busts out, or give thanks that he’s able to do them? Do you despair at the lack of rhythm that seems to accompany fatherhood, or appreciate the specialness of the beat of his own drum? I think few of us could honestly say we’d answer the latter for any of the above but such questions, and more, lie at the heart of devised dance piece Dad Dancing which encourages us to reconsider. Created and developed by three dance students looking to engage their fathers in their chosen craft beyond the standard attendance at the end-of-year showcases, this beautifully warm-hearted show has a most beguiling quality. Exploring not only their own relationships with their fathers, who appear alongside them here at the Battersea Arts Centre, they’re helped by a large supporting cast who bring their own father/child experiences to bear. Thus a whole spectrum of experience stands before us, asking what it means to be a son or daughter, to be a father, to be a dancer. There’s a bittiness which is the hallmark of pretty much any devised show but equally a tautness which prevents Dad Dancing from ever being too indulgent. The women – Rosie Heafford, Alexandrina Hemsley and Helena Webb – use the full, expressive range of their contemporary dance skill to speak of what they’ve longed to say, the fathers – Adrian, Andy and David – bring their unique sense of movement which may be a mite more ungainly but no less eloquent in its willingness to participate in their childrens’ world, and the small but vital contributions from the chorus have a real potent power."
1446,1446,Ought To Be Clowns,28/05/2010,Ian,The Late Middle Classes, Donmar Warehouse,"I love Helen McCrory. Like really love her. I have an endless list of actresses whom I really like, but McCrory sits pretty on top of the heap, having found a place in my heart through a select number of roles in film, tv and onstage, almost all of which are indelibly etched on my mind, such is the power of her acting. So when she was announced as leading the Donmar Warehouse’s production of Simon Gray’s The Late Middle Classes, I giddily booked my tickets for this, the second preview. Written in 1999, the play actually opened in Watford but did not make the anticipated transfer into London, being bizarrely usurped by a shortlived play called Boyband so this marks the first time it has been seen in the capital. Set in the 1950s, it follows a middle-class family, bored Celia, work-obsessed Charles and their son Holliday who is discovering about life through his music lessons with the neighbourly Mr Brownlow. It is actually told in flashback by the adult Holliday recollecting his childhood after an impromptu visit to his old music tutor and the challenges posed by the post-war environment in the UK. It is felt much more strongly by his parents whose privileged position in the class structure has been lost in the face of continuing rations and an almost pyrrhic sense of victory which has not resulted in any improvement in their lives. Helen McCrory is just fantastic as Celia, struggling to deal with the constricted opportunities offered to her as a woman after the liberation of real work driving ambulances in the Second World War, playing at being the perfect wife but unsure of how to behave as a mother and ultimately finding refuge in tennis lessons and copious amounts of gin. She seems able to pack every single movement and glance with such a wealth of powerful emotion that it is impossible to drag one’s eyes from her: watch her reaction when Charles asks her if her bad mood is due to her period, absolutely priceless. She also looks stunning in her blue dress and her satin shirt and slacks ensemble. But there is impressive work from the rest of the cast too. In fact Robert Glenister’s first appearance which opens the show is jaw-dropping, he has been aged considerably to play the older Mr Brownlow and it is just shockingly effective. He absolutely nails this senior version with a stunning conviction that it then becomes a little hard to follow him in the flashback narrative as his genial music teacher displays hints of repressed homosexuality and an increasingly disturbing familiarity with the young teenage Holly. But he does it extremely well and we care enough to want to find out the truth of this relationship, I’m only sad that he was only able to appear here due to Hedda Gabler not securing a West End transfer. Eleanor Bron as his mother was interesting, but as a somewhat minor role had little impact on the production as a whole. Peter Sullivan’s Charles is a model of starched, emotionally constipated Englishness, piercingly funny with his crisp clipped tones and a wonderful line in dismissive one-liners “I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do…”, he’d never admit it but he represents the last gasps of the class system irrevocably changed by war but clenched, unforgiving and unwavering to the last, there’s no changing him. The young Holliday is shared by three young actors and it is a surprisingly big role, he is thoroughly involved in most of the scenes. I saw Lawrence Belcher who was excellent, with a great chemistry with both McCrory and Glenister. The set is fairly ugly to be honest, the back wall is covered in a floral wallpaper and the flooring is beige carpet. Combined with the furniture in brown leatherette, it’s all assumably authentically 50s looking just not particularly attractive. Matters are not helped by the edge of the stage being illuminated, an effect which just looks leftover from Polar Bears and somewhat unnecessary and incongruous in the scene changes. And then there is the piano. Both Holly and Mr Brownlow play throughout the show but it is an automatic machine so more often than not, the actors are miming playing and doing it badly. In a space like the Donmar, the intimacy is unforgiving and there was some laughable attempts at replicating the tinkling of the ivories with hands being nowhere the keys going down. Still, the acting is of such quality and the characters created sufficiently intriguing that little quibbles like these just don’t matter. I’d recommend this in a heartbeat, Helen McCrory’s performance alone is worth the entrance fee but she is just one element of what is an extremely strong production for the Donmar Warehouse. I saw it on Friday 28th and was mesmerised.  McCrory,, although fluffing her lines quite a lot, delivered a performance of nerve-jangling intensity, and the rest of the cast, especially the young boy, were also excellent.  Really recommend. Absolutely loved it too.  SO much to think about: a lot of ambiguity, so refreshing at the moment.  I really likd Eleanor Bron too.  I completely got her personal struggle and fear of the present being evaoprated, in contrast to McCrory's character who wants change more than anything.  Saw Lawrence Belcher too: just phenomenal."
1447,1447,Ought To Be Clowns,23/04/2010,Ian,Pressure Drop, Wellcome Collection,"In dealing with the rise of far right politics in East London, Pressure Drop could be just one of many similar plays, A Day at the Racists and Moonfleece both dealt with related themes very recently, but this is really is something special, bringing together Mick Gordon’s writing, songwriting from Billy Bragg and the unique venue of the Wellcome Collection, their first foray into theatre, as part of their Identity project. Describing it as a ‘part-gig, part-concert, part-installation’ is somewhat unnecessary, it’s a promenade play with some songs in it, but it is a carefully judged production, balancing each of the elements well into a most satisfying whole. It looks at three generations of the Clegg family, white and working class in a rapidly changing East London, and how they struggle to maintain their identities even as everything familiar alters around them. It is powerfully presented, painfully real and totally engrossing. I was completely hooked by the story, complemented excellently by the music and the staging works very well. The dialogue is just superb, so perfectly crafted and frighteningly realistic, no more so than in David Kennedy’s menacingly thuggish Tony, a powerful presence full of endless bluster and seething with prejudicial rage. Any play featuring not one but two actors from one of my absolutely top-rated shows from last year, Our Class, had to be good and Michael Gould and Justin Salinger did not disappoint, both providing touching performances as brothers whose lives have taken them on completely different paths. Susan Vidler works magic with few scenes as the struggling matriarch of the family, trying to avoid remembering childhood dreams and aspirations in the face of disillusionment of the daily grind and Shea Davis also deserves a mention as the young George, desperately trying to find his own identity in the face of the prejudice around him. The play cleverly shows how complex and messy it can be to maintain these ideas of identity in the face of conflicting pressures, the two different father/son relationships showing this perfectly in how the sins of the father don’t always have to be passed down to the son, but also acknowledging how difficult it can be to escape these long held values. The staging is highly effective and all the more brilliant considering this is normally a regular exhibition space at the Wellcome. A red slash cuts through the walls of the room, with three small raised stages as a pub, a chapel and a living room, with Bragg and his band perched on a fourth in the middle of the room. Bragg’s songs are lyrically powerful and imbued with a lifetime of passion for politics, and musically, cleverly show up the irony inherent in the close links between the reggae music that came over with the Windrush and the ska music beloved by skinheads, despite their overtly racist posturing. I must confess to a history with the Wellcome Trust. I was a Wellcome scholar as a postgraduate and should have done a doctorate with them, but then I would have been Doctor Foster and I’d’ve had to move to Gloucester etc etc so I left academia as a mere Master of Philosophy. That said, I did spend much time in the fabulous Wellcome surroundings and it is a highly recommended, and free, destination where you can happily while away an afternoon in their galleries and exhibitions. As Billy Bragg himself said afterwards, art may not be able to change things but it can make you think. And in these precarious times, especially for Bragg’s native Barking and Dagenham, Pressure Drop is a timely reminder of both the need to recognise the frustrations of a working class who feel betrayed but also the importance of showing up the abhorrence of far right politics and how it can never be the answer. One hour five minutes? It was closer to 2 hours on the night I saw it. Great piece though, well executed, and an interesting use of the space. I hope they continue to use it so creatively."
1448,1448,Ought To Be Clowns,10/11/2012,Ian,The Trojan Women, Gate Theatre,"After Mike Bartlett’s inimitable slant on Euripides in his contemporary version of Medea for Headlong, it is now the turn of poet Caroline Bird to reimagine the world of Ancient Greek tragedy for modern times with her take on the same playwright’s The Trojan Women, directed by the Gate’s own AD Christopher Haydon. Set in the mother and baby ward of a prison in the fallen city of Troy, the mothers, wives and sisters of the destroyed army await their fate as the marauding Greek invaders decide how to divide their spoils of war, chief among them Hecuba, the former queen and Helen, the woman in whose name the Greeks fought their bloody war. (FYI I attended the final preview, courtesy of their bargaintastic Gatecrasher offer). Bird’s prose clearly has a keen poetic edge, especially in conjuring up the desolation of a defeated nation, and perhaps surprisingly it also opens a vein of bleak humour, at times a blessed relief from the sheer harshness of it all but also sometimes feeling dangerously close to a glibness that feels wrong and best embodied by Jon Foster’s blokey Talthybius who is frequently very close to this line. Lucy Ellinson’s excellent one-woman Chorus negotiates the balancing act with much more skill, her very pregnant tragicomic countrywoman shackled to the bed and thus an unwitting witness to everything, passing incisive comment, asking pertinent questions, bitterly relating the very human toll of the conflict to those normally protected by palace walls. Dearbhla Molloy’s icily regal Hecuba is a study in stubborn disbelief, unrepentant of her decadent lifestyle and the choices that have (partially) led to the downfall of Troy and the death of so many of her sons. But her torment is not yet over as she still has daughters and grandchildren, and Molloy skilfully shows the slow crumbling of resolve as horror follows horror follows horror, yet still possessed of a feistiness that will never quit. And one certainly gets one’s money’s worth of Louise Brealey who is cross-cast as Cassandra, Andromache and Helen, putting across the respective tortured anguish, bitter recrimination and cool self-preservation of the three younger women whose fates are variously resolved by the men who are their new masters. In modernising Greek tragedy though, there is always the issue of how to deal with the gods. Divine manipulation comes as part and parcel of this ancient world, so relocating the story to a modern context has to somehow take this into account. Bird and Haydon deal with this by having Poseidon (a wonderfully sardonic Roger Lloyd Pack) and Athena (a drily dismissive Tamsin Greig) appear on flickering video screens, an otherworldly presence framing the action. But they also try to have it the other way too, with a healthy dose of scepticism being directed at those directly affected by interventions from Mount Olympus – it left me rather confused as to whether this was a world in which people believed in the gods or not, or indeed if this was actually important – I’m still not decided."

1450,1450,Ought To Be Clowns,05/10/2012,Ian,Fireface, Young Vic,"Tucked away in the intimate Clare studio at the back of the Young Vic is Fireface, a 1997 work by German playwright Marius von Mayenburg, directed by Sam Pritchard, the winner of the 2012 JMK Award for visionary new theatre directors. And with the aid of an intriguingly strong cast and Amanda Stoodley’s wide chipboard frame of a set, forming a timber cage for a dysfunctional family to play out their not-inconsiderable dramas, Pritchard has certainly made the most of his opportunity. Quite how one judges his measure of success though is a matter of debate. He clearly has a keen eye for the highly theatrical: switching from having the actors sitting facing the audience and speaking their lines out to us rather than to each other to a more naturalistic style with a dizzying frequency and overlapping the scenes to increase the disconcerting effect of estrangement. It initially feels apt as a way to evoke the disquiet at the heart of this family home where Kurt and Olga are seething with teenage injustice, railing against their distracted parents and exploring an increasingly too-close bond full of burning desire. The tension between the two styles is never quite satisfactorily resolved though, the figurative levels of Maja Zade’s translation somewhat at odds with Mayenburg’s indictment of the bourgeois middle classes, and Pritchard doesn’t quite marry everything together. Visual ideas like the imprisoning red tape are left under-developed with little sense of the set ever representing something bigger, more societal, to justify the larger metaphor at work here; and the lack of time spent delving into the psyches of these teenagers – especially the sexually questioning Olga – means the realistic side lacks bite too. But there’s strength in performance too which helps to hold the production together. Helen Schlesinger and David Annen lend immense class to the parents blithely sure that all the incest and psychosis going on under their nose is just a phase, William Postlethwaite’s interloping new boyfriend forms a neat counterpoint to the screwed intensity of Rupert Simonian’s Kurt and Aimeé-Ffion Edwards confirms her onward rise to becoming one of our most interesting young actresses as she wrestles the slipperiness of Olga nearly into submission."
1451,1451,Ought To Be Clowns,23/02/2018,Ian,The Winter’s Tale, National Theatre,"The invitation to this adaptation of The Winter’s Tale came hand in hand with the warning that it is for younger audiences but even if it is aimed at 8-12 year olds, there was much to enjoy, lots to appreciate and just enough to make me cry. The excellent promotional image aside, it was the excellent Justin Audibert directing that was the main draw here and his work with his company did not disappoint. Streamlined down to an hour, the focus really comes down to the relationships between parent and child, enhancing the throughline of the storytelling beautifully. I loved the idea that the root of this Leontes’ jealousy lay in Polixenes being a better dancer but by having Gabby Wong’s Perdita frame the whole thing as her story and giving Mamillius more time in the sun than usual here, there’s no doubting this is a story of fractured families and how, if at all, they can ever heal.    What I really loved though, was the way in which the production highlighted the beauty and rough magic of live theatre, emphasising how Shakespeare needs to be seen and not just heard for schoolkids to really ‘get’ it. Whether the way songs created atmosphere or propelled narrative, the use of puppetry to break the fourth wall, the sheer gorgeousness achieved with a single piece of flowing fabric or the power of even a simple bit of movement, there’s something deeply emotive about the work here. And I think it important to commend the diversity of the cast, particularly in assembling non-representational family units, for this is the power of theatre, to open minds, to expand our view of what the world can be. What could merely be dismissed as make-believe gains real significance in what it can achieve for social cohesion, planting seeds in the minds of future theatremakers who will hopefully be able to dislodge (at least some of) the traditional conventions that still dominate the British theatre landscape in all its snow-whiteness. "
1452,1452,Ought To Be Clowns,17/02/2016,mag9l,Poppy + George, Watford Palace,"There’s something rather gorgeous at the heart of Poppy + George, a recognition that even passing acquaintances can leave as lasting impressions as the deepest of friendships; a reminder too that even if a play can be over and done with in a couple of hours, its impact can linger far beyond. So it is for the group of people who find each other in Diane Samuels’ new play for the Watford Palace Theatre, with music by Gwyneth Herbert. Their safe haven is a warehouse deep in the East End in 1919, where Russian Jewish (with a bit of Chinese) tailor Smith plies his trade and entertains his friends nattily dressed chauffeur George Sampson and Great War veteran Tommy Johns who is trying to resurrect his fading music hall career. Into their world comes Poppy Wright, a Northern girl looking for a fresh start from a life in service, though the love she finds turns out not to be quite what she expected. For though a romance does develop between Poppy and George, hence the title!, Samuels makes us care about all the relationships in the play. At a time of such seismic change after WWI, the whole world seems in flux and it seems opportunities and challenges lie hand in hand round every corner. So as women seize the initiative with the Suffragette movement, sweeping up the newly politicised Poppy, the flipside of increasing confidence sees Tommy’s wife repeatedly tip him out on the street. Tommy’s female-impersonator music hall numbers play in but also break up the scenes (a neat nod to this venue’s historical origins) and Herbert’s music is ideally suited to the purpose, wittily and achingly performed by Mark Rice-Oxley. Jacob Krichefski’s Smith is largely inscrutable but undeniably warm of heart as he expresses himself through his costumery; and Rebecca Oldfield’s George emerges as a truly fascinating character as his layers are revealed in all their complicated emotion."
1453,1453,Ought To Be Clowns,04/07/2012,Ian,The Golden Age of Broadway, Royal Festival Hall,"Despite, or maybe because of, its richly diverse programming, the Royal Festival Hall has played host to two of my all-time favourite gigs ever: Röyksopp/Fever Ray and A Celebration of Kate McGarrigle. Not quite reaching those giddy heights but then again not so very far off was The Golden Age of Broadway, a celebration of the classic musicals of the 1950s and 1960s that still rank amongst some of the all-time greats. It was the kind of evening that made me just feel sad for those people who insist that they don’t like musicals for whatever reason, it just feels like they’re missing out on so much joy and fun and in this case, a damn good evening. Bryn Terfel was sold as the leading man – he is in the midst of a mini-season on the South Bank – but in truth it was a much more balanced company affair, with Julian Ovenden, Clive Rowe, Hannah Waddingham and Emma Williams joining in to share the load. And this is where the evening really shone, with the irrepressible quality of the cast allowed to shine both individually, and together in various combinations as they cherry-picked from some of the best shows – and songs – ever written. And it was as good as it promised to be and then some. Hannah Waddingham (evidently on day release from Kiss Me, Kate, along with Clive Rowe) continued her quest to prove she is simply one of the best performers we are blessed to have with us. Her ‘Blow, Gabriel, Blow’ sparkled with clarity, wit and that powerhouse vocal; ‘Show Me’ brought out her comic side well; I’m not 100% sure that I need to see or hear her Rita Moreno impression again and any slight mis-step there was more than compensated for with a spine-tingling rendition of ‘Something Wonderful’, sung with perfectly calibrated restraint and demonstrating how versatile a star she is. Her frequent contributions to concerts such as this and other good causes like this and this will be sorely missed when she emigrates to Australia at the end of Kiss Me, Kate. It makes me eternally sad that we live in a world where Emma Williams isn’t constantly on our stages and she proved her leading-lady credentials here, skipping with a beautiful touch through ‘A Wonderful Guy’ and ‘I Could Have Danced All Night’, radiating charismatic warmth with Clive Rowe on a romp through ‘You’re The Top’, and forming part of the majestic ‘Quintet’ from West Side Story. It was nice to see Clive Rowe being able to show off his sharper comic skills that his recent default dopey character choices have not allowed him to display, ‘Sit Down You’re Rocking The Boat’ being his highlight. And Julian Ovenden came close to stealing the show with his laidback and seemingly effortless vocal prowess, investing Maria with a palpable yearning. My niggles were of the tiniest variety: having opened with the glorious overture from Gypsy, my heart raced at the thought that we might get Waddingham giving us a taster of what will surely be the perfect role for her in the future, and Terfel seemed a little stiff in the first half – his ‘So In Love’ felt more like the declaration of a stalker than anything – his vocal performance too lifeless against the musical theatre wonder around him, but post interval an informality kicked in which was definitely to his credit."
1454,1454,Ought To Be Clowns,07/05/2010,Ian,Me, As A Penguin,"Me, As A Penguin is a slightly surreal but gently affectionate tale of the struggle of four twenty-somethings in the search for personal identity. Marking the professional full length debut of playwright Tom Wells in London, it takes up residence in the small Studio 2 at Dalston’s Arcola Theatre. Set in Hull, Liz is nine months pregnant and hosting Stitch, her shy gay brother who’s trying to escape life at home in a tiny village stuck working in a knitting shop, but he’s struggling a bit. He’s not connecting with Liz’s partner Mark and connecting too much with Mark’s predatory gay friend Dave. What follows is a stonkingly well-written tale of stolen penguins, experimental knitting and a whole lot of Battenberg cake. It is fast-paced, contemporary and extremely funny, with hidden depths that ensure some real emotional investment, a most promising debut play indeed. Where it is particularly strong, and in a most pleasing way for me, is in its depiction of its two gay characters. Without resorting to employing beautiful young men to wander around shirtless, something several gay plays in London are currently guilty of, Wells has crafted two wildly different yet ultimately convincing and recognisable young men. Ian Bonar is simply outstanding as the ever-tongue-tied, painfully shy Stitch, struggling to make the transition to the (relatively) metropolitan gay lifestyle offered by Hull and deal with the emotions provoked by finally embracing his homosexuality. And with the penguin-suited (don’t ask!) Dave, we have as realistic and uncompromising a gay character as I’ve seen recently: arrogant, unashamedly horny, Daniel Abelson invests the right level of self-assuredness that tramples over all around him to great effect. Samantha Power and John Catterall also do well as Liz and Mark, young expectant parents with a sparky relationship that is not as solid as perhaps it might be and full of gloriously witty repartee. Power in particular is superb as the tenderly protective sister trying to manage with her brother’s reticence and the apprehension about Mark nagging away at her. And Catterall balances her well, with his mixture of affable blokeish awkwardness and a genuinely sweet nature, tempered with his fears about having to grow up into his impending role as father."
1455,1455,Ought To Be Clowns,14/09/2015,mag9l,The Commitments, Palace,"Cast and crew members across the West End may not agree but I do find it surprising that more shows haven’t gone for the variation of Sunday evening performances in their schedules. Particularly with tourists, it’s a ready-made and captive audience with little else to do in this bustling city and by the looks of the Palace Theatre last night, keen as mustard. That said, it can be something of a trial going out on a Sunday night when a work-filled Monday morning is looming around the corner. For me though, the chance to see The Commitments one more time before it closes its doors after a run that has lasted more than two years was enough to tempt me out and I’m glad I did as it really is good fun. Technically speaking, it is less of a musical than I would strictly consider, the narrative quickly gives way to a mini-concert at the show’s end but with music as good as this, and an actor-musician cast as talented as this, such crowd-pleasing antics feel entirely forgivable. And I’d forgotten how witty Jamie Lloyd’s production was in Soutra Gilmour’s endlessly inventive set (the rain!), evoking a strong sense of 80s Dublin life and the escape that music provides for so many. The ‘You Just Keep Me Hangin’ On’ sequence as the various new band members learn their separate parts and then come together gloriously breathes new life in a hackneyed cinematic trope and delivers a solid gold moment."
1456,1456,Ought To Be Clowns,01/09/2016,mag9l,The Burnt Part Boys, Park,"Another quickie as I continue to catch up with the openings I missed whilst on holiday. Receiving its European premiere here at the Park, The Burnt Part Boys continues the surprising number of musicals about mining (Floyd Collins alone would have scratched the itch, never mind Billy Elliot) and true to form, is musically really quite interesting. Chris Miller’s score folds in bluegrass and folk influences as befits its West Virginia setting and is certainly the strongest part of the show. Mariana Elder’s book follows the impact of a tragic mining disaster on the hillside community of Pickaway – several men were killed and their bodies trapped underground but ten years later, news breaks that the mine is to be reopened, causing varied responses from the sons who lost their fathers. And particularly from brothers Pete and Jake, the former stealing some dynamite from his older sibling – now a miner himself – to force his own solution."
1457,1457,Ought To Be Clowns,16/02/2017,mag9l,Flew the Coop, New Diorama,"Part of the New Diorama’s Emerging Theatre Company Programme 2015, Lost Watch have spent the last four years building quite the reputation for themselves. Their latest show Flew the Coop takes inspiration from a photograph of real-life British prisoner of war Horace Greasley and Silesian translator Rosa Rauchbach, for whom he claims he escaped over 200 times in order to conduct a love affair. It is told, with great energy and enthusiasm, through the prism of the Rauchbach Greasley Association Society Club (RGASC), a motley crew of Silesians (a historic region now split between Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic) who lovingly re-enact the story of their heroes with great ingenuity, using an array of brooms, brushes, sticks and buckets and not much more besides. Louise Skaaning’s production is ramshackle, but deliberately so, and the fast-moving pace keeps everything light, even though it is set in wartime (1943) and in a prison camp. The unlikely love story (the sex scenes are rather amusingly covered by group dance routines) is augmented by the multiple escape attempts and the capers that ensue are charismatically performed by Dearden and Daniel Holme as the central couple. "
1458,1458,Ought To Be Clowns,22/06/2018,Ian,Wicked, Apollo Victoria,"Off the top of my head, I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve seen Wicked now – it feels like loads – so it’s useful that I have it all written down in a blog… I do know it is a good while since I last saw it, five years in fact, which was evidently my third visit to the Apollo Victoria and one which left me disappointed. So it has taken a little while for me to get interested in taking up an opportunity to go see it again but we got there, eventually. And I have to say I enjoyed my return trip to Oz, mainly because of the sensational performance of Alice Fearn as Elphaba. It’s always nice to see a performer rewarded for paying their dues, working their way up through ensemble and chorus roles until they get that chance to shine. And because of that background, that experience, that starring role has the real sense of being a career-defining opportunity. Next to her, Sophie Evans’ Glinda exudes an entirely different energy, a quirkier take on the role than I remember having seen and it is one that works. Bradley Jaden’s Fiyero might have distractingly luscious locks but he’s a compelling singer and as the OG Mrs Phelps, Melanie La Barrie (Madame Morrible) will always have a special place in my heart. And it is interesting to see how the themes of the show take on new and different complexions for the particular day and age. The inter-species discrimination once again feels all-too-pertinent at a moment when intolerance towards the ‘other’ – however that is defined – is so high in our daily discourse. Might be time to get defying gravity once again."
1459,1459,Ought To Be Clowns,30/08/2016,mag9l,Made In Dagenham, Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch,"Made in Dagenham, in Dagenham – it seems like a no-brainer but it’s quite the statement of intent from incoming Artistic Director at the Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch, Douglas Rintoul. It’s also a bit of a departure for a director who has previously won awards for writing hard-hitting monologues about gay Iraqi refugees (the exceptionally good Elegy) but taking a West End musical that didn’t quite become the hit it deserves and taking it home, refining it into an actor-musician production along the way, turns out to be quite the treat. I can’t deny that I loved the show when it played at the Adelphi – heck, I saw it four times (review #1, review #2, review #3, review #4 of the final night) and I believe it deserved better treatment from the critics. But the past is the past and coming to the show with fresh eyes, and ears, too Richard Bean’s book and David Arnold’s score, it responds powerfully to the new treatment here (co-produced by the Queen’s and the New Wolsey Ipswich where it heads next), smaller in scale obviously but more intimate too, rawer in its emotions to an ultimately devastating effect.  Stepping into the shoes of Rita O’Grady, a (fictionalised) Ford Dagenham worker who lead her fellow machinists on a strike campaign that culminated in the (all too true) amazing achievement of the establishment of the 1970 Equal Pay Act, Daniella Bowen takes her time to make her mark but we come to see that it is a deliberate decision. This Rita really does lack confidence, in herself, in her ability, even in her marriage, and Bowen makes you feel every inch of her awkward pain – the beautiful ‘We Nearly Had It All’ thus drips with a startling bitterness, her earlier tears heartbreaking. And on the flip side, once she finally believes in herself enough to deliver a climactic speech to the TUC, ‘Stand Up’ becomes this hugely passionate moment, truly transformative as the pieces finally fall together and it is goosebumpingly effective. Bowen is supported by a top cast of actor-musos who by and large cleave quite closely to the interpretations seen in the West End. So Angela Bain’s Beryl is hilariously profane and Sarah Scowen’s Clare daffy as a brush, Alex Tomkins’ Eddie is a lovable chump of a husband and Claire Machin is a brassy delight as Barbara Castle.  The broader edges of the comedy remain present and remain not quite to my taste – the end-of-the-pier take on Harold Wilson and brash Americana not quite sharp enough. But under Ben Goddard’s assured musical direction which plays out in Hayley Grindle’s highly functional design, Arnold’s score sounds fresh as a daisy. The richness of the female harmonies lie closer to the surface (‘This Is What We Want’ is just luscious) and more generally, the communal feel of the music is enhanced. "

1461,1461,Ought To Be Clowns,29/08/2013,Ian,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Theatre Royal Drury Lane,"One of the hottest tickets of the year is a golden one. London gets its second major adaptation of a Roald Dahl story into a big budget piece of musical theatre as the long-awaited Charlie and the Chocolate Factory finally opens its gates at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane. And taking his cue from Willy Wonka, director Sam Mendes has mixed it with love and made it taste good, displaying, along with designer Mark Thompson, just as much wit and invention as the candyman himself in bringing this world to such entertaining life on the stage. David Greig’s book remains largely faithful to Dahl’s novel, but expanding the poverty-stricken domestic set-up of Charlie Bucket and his extended family as the young boy dreams of finding one of five elusive passes into Wonka’s mysterious factory. As the tickets are found one by one in a series of vividly realised tableaux, his hopes recede but the presence of a shadowy tramp-like figure ensures that there’s soon a golden twinkle in Charlie’s eye and a life-changing journey can begin. Much of the pleasure of this production comes from the strength of its performances. We saw Isaac Rouse take on the role of Charlie, shared with three others, with a clear, wide-eyed charm which keeps his innocence just about on the right side of cute. The other kids fare better: Harrison Slater’s beefy Bavarian Augustus Gloop, Polly Allen as a most determined Veruca Salt, India Ria Amarteifio’s streetwise gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde and Adam Mitchell’s hyperactive and hyperviolent Mike Teavee all getting their chance to shine in each half as they gradually fall foul of Wonka’s brand of aptitude tests. Oompah Loompah doompadah dee indeed. That said, Marc Shaiman has created an entirely new score for this show – just Pure Imagination remains of Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley’s music for the 1971 film – and it is solid rather than spectacular, the music doesn’t crackle with the same ingenuity as the visual language used, which is often breath-taking. From magic tricks to nifty choreography, a Quentin Blake animated opening sequence to the technically magnificent backdrops, it often looks amazing. And in the middle of it all is Douglas Hodge’s fantastic Willy Wonka, closer to malevolent than mischievous as those who cross him soon find out, but also capable of warmth and wonder as in the climactic elevator ride.  There are some mis-steps – placing the interval where it is means the first half feels overlong and the second half a little too rushed, a sequence in the Nut Room calls to mind a demented take on The Nutcracker and the Great Glass Elevator seems set to prove a technological hazard. And like many a sweet treat, these can occasionally feel like empty calories with little of substance ever coming through with any of the characters, no real emotion ever being mined alongside the wonder."
1462,1462,Ought To Be Clowns,15/10/2020,Ian,Macbeth, Big Telly Theatre,"With its cast members scattered across Belfast, Deal, Deptford, Dublin and London, it’s a remarkable achievement in and of itself that this production of Macbeth can exist at all in these Covid-19 times. But founder and artistic director of Big Telly Theatre Zoe Seaton has been quick off the mark to explore the creative opportunities of these constraints and this marks her fifth lockdown production. And you can see how deftly experienced hands are shaping this new kind of experience. An inspired bit of pre-show business brilliantly skewers the government’s daily Covid briefings as it introduces its own version of track and trace which is implemented on some unsuspecting audience members. It also frames the world of this production as a plaything of the weird sisters, the ones who are truly in charge here.  It is a bold gambit, and one which works intermittently here. The moody monochrome of the opening section, underscored by the Celtic murmurs of Garth McConaghie’s score, have a distinct and dystopian vision that cuts through the heavily trimmed version of the play we’re getting here. But despite an imaginative mode of transformation into a world of technicolour for the coronation, there’s an increasing sense of too much being thrown at the production."
1463,1463,Ought To Be Clowns,19/10/2014,Ian,Rachel, Finborough,"Written in response to the glorification of the Ku Klux Klan contained in 1915 film The Birth of a Nation,Angelina Weld Grimké’s Rachel has the remarkable tag of being the first play by an African-American woman to ever be produced professionally. Despite that, it has languished mostly unseen since then and this revival by the Finborough marks the European premiere and a contribution to the work of Black History Month. It’s easy to dismiss work such as this saying it has collected dust on the shelves for a reason but this fascinating context alone surely negates that and in Ola Ince’s production, dramatic reasons emerge too.  Miquel Brown’s superb Mrs Loving swept up her children Rachel and Tom after tragedy hit their Southern home and relocated them to a northern city where things have been better, just. The problem being that the expectations that accompanied their education remain unfulfilled, society may have moved a little quicker up here but not that much. Napay Kpaka’s hugely appealing Tom can’t get work as an engineer for love nor money and Adelayo Adedayo traces the dampening of Rachel’s optimism with real power, the girlish dreams of the play’s opening slowly shattered by the revelation of how sheltered she has been from the ugliness of the racist world at large."
1464,1464,Ought To Be Clowns,25/06/2016,mag9l,The Suicide, National,"A late jaunt to the National to The Suicide, Suhayla El-Bushra’s fiercely contemporary updating of Nikolai Erdman’s 1928 play, before it closed. Though I have to say I wasn’t entirely convinced by it, Nadia Fall’s production is visually hugely ambitious, retooled for the world of YouTubers and hipsters, but ultimately feeling as shallow as the societal trends that it is trying to satirise. Javone Prince’s Sam Desai is long-term unemployed and newly bereft of benefits, so disillusioned with the world is he that he decides to top himself but when a film clip of him making that decision goes viral, he’s swept along for the ride as all of society try to co-opt him for their own ends. To publicise a café, to get a music deal, to highlight the lack of adequate mental health care. But even as it lacerates politicians trying to seize the moment for themselves or people trying to get their 15 minutes of fame no matter what, the desperately unsubtle humour weighs it down severely. There’s no satirical refinement, its near pantomime at times, nor true dramatic impetus as the plotting never attempts to convince seriously, and so the play falls flat."
1465,1465,Ought To Be Clowns,13/11/2017,Ian,Network, National Theatre," With Network, Lee Hall’s adaptation of Paddy Chayefsky’s 1976 film, Ivo van Hove re-asserts his place as one of the premier theatremakers working, anywhere. A satire that managed to predict just how powerful a tool populist anger can be when leveraged effectively, it is transformed into the immersive bustle of a TV studio, that of UBS Evening News where old hack Howard Beale – a transcendent performance by Bryan Cranston – has been handed his notice. Though initially appearing to accept it with good grace, he causes an almighty media stir when he declares, on air, that he’s going to kill himself, triggering a most unlikely rebirth as a truth-spilling ‘prophet’. And as ever, van Hove and designer Jan Versweyveld challenge our notions of theatrical space and how it is used. An onstage restaurant puts (some) audience members right in the thick of the action, the fourth wall gets well and truly shattered, and the use of live video and big screens forces us into the role of active observers – as Beale goes live on air, do you watch Cranston himself, do you watch him onscreen, do you watch the team observing him from the producers’ box…the multiplicity of perspectives reminds us how easy it is to manipulate media, how there can always be other sides to the story. The less charitably minded might point to recycled devices and say ‘same old bag of tricks’ but I prefer to think of it as the establishment of a house style, of a theatrical language that many try to imitate but few ever succeed. And in any case, there are clever spins here, constantly springing surprise elements – i.e. just who the initial countdown is for, the coup de théâtre enabled by the camera filming from above, and who could ever get bored of the seamlessness with which Tal Yarden’s video design tracks scenes from outside right onto the Lyttelton stage. And for all the creative ingenuity at work, there’s thrillingly committed acting at Network’s foundation. Michelle Dockery’s producer Diana is ferociously ambitious as she suggests just how far reality TV will push the boundaries of established decency, Richard Cordery’s Jensen chills as the embodiment of corporate management, by contrast Douglas Henshall finds compassionate depth in Max and there’s essential work too from Caroline Faber as his wife Louise, even in the limited stage time she gets. As the total focus of the story though – a particular triumph in Hall’s selective editing of his adaptation – Cranston’s Beale is a titanic achievement, his every utterance and movement utterly unmissable as circumstance prevails to postpone his mental breakdown but not entirely thwart it. Even as this late career renaissance kicks in, we never lose the sense of a man teetering on the edge, knowing his fate is inevitable even as he taps into a national mood that threatens to upend the system, drain the swamp even. But it is the melding of all these elements into a hugely satisfying whole that makes Network sing, particularly when van Hove is delivering iconic images that sear themselves into the mind. The visual overload of the ‘mad as hell’ scene going viral, Beale’s stark silhouette subservient to the messianic delivery of Jensen’s eerily prescient speech about the ramifications of untrammeled globalisation, the hall of mirrors effect that Yarden deploys on Cranston’s face at a crucial moment. In so many ways, this is theatre at its most exciting.  "
1466,1466,Ought To Be Clowns,21/08/2011,Ian,Summer with the Composers, Battersea Barge via britishtheatre.tv,"The evening was focused on four leading lights of new British musical theatre writing: Grant Olding, Dougal Irvine, Laurence Mark Wythe and Tim Sutton and showcasing their work in a variety of ways from shows that have made it onto the stage, shows that are still in development, some which never made it out of the rehearsal room and a few one-offs, including one written especially for the Dress Circle Benefit gig a couple of weeks ago. Special guests Samantha Barks, Annalene Beechey, George Ure and Stephen Ashfield sang a selection of the songs but the composers themselves also had a go at singing each other’s songs. Highlights for me included Stephen Ashfield returning to Laurence Mark Wythe’s ‘Tomorrow Morning with The Dream’ (although in a much amended version since he last sang it!); Samantha Barks and George Ure duetting on ‘Turn Your Head’ from Through The Door and Annalene Beechey’s quietly moving ‘Hannah’s Song’. It would have been nice to hear more from Ashfield but Samantha Barks really did have a great evening though – her ‘Simply Cinderella’ from one of Grant Olding’s shows was fantastic – she has developed into something of a fascinating performer and I’d love to see her onstage in something modern and musical. It was also interesting to hear the little snippets of conversation in-between songs, talking about the various ways in which their shows had been supported and developed whether through agencies like Perfect Pitch or through crowdsourcing resources like WeFund."
1467,1467,Ought To Be Clowns,20/01/2020,Ian,Fairview, Young Vic,"I still can’t work out what I want to say about Fairview, a show that by its very nature demands that you don’t give anything away about it (even though saying this itself feels like a heightening of expectation you could do without)."
1468,1468,Ought To Be Clowns,26/06/2015,mag9l,Violence and Son, Royal Court,"Even now, a week after I saw Gary Owen’s Violence and Son, I still don’t know what to say about it or more importantly, how to say it – it’s a rare thing for a play to stun me into such silence but a magnificent one too. Cai Dyfan’s circular set recalls the similar set-up for Mike Bartlett’s Cock but with its dirty white plastic chairs and drab demeanour, it speaks of something or somewhere more desperate – in this particular case, the isolation of the Welsh valleys but only a fool would say this story and its ramifications, as searchingly highlighted by director Hamish Pirie, are limited to that sole location. Life is tough enough as a Doctor Who fan but 17-year-old Liam is suffering more than most after his mother’s death has meant to has to move Wales to live with the father who left before he was even born. Rick, whose nickname gives the show its title, claims to have last been sober when he was 14 and rage follows in his every footstep as he thinks nothing of battering everything and everyone around him. And as father and son get to know each other, Owen makes a powerful argument about the appalling toxicity of stereotypical notions of masculinity but also how difficult it is to shake a generational legacy.  Things come to a head when Liam brings home Jen, a fellow Whovian, and sets about trying to disentangle her from her current relationship with assistance from his dad – the one eager to prove he has a paternal instinct, the other eager to follow. But responsibility and gender relations aren’t a specialist subject in this slice of society, as chillingly explained by Jen and Suze, Rick’s lover, as they recount the sexual harassment they’re subjected to during every single visit down to the local, and the ugly issue of domestic violence soon rears its head in all its messy complexity.  And it is complex – Owen and Pirie expertly push and pull us from pillar to post, light to dark, acquiescent to appalled as different sides to the story emerge and competing accounts battle for sympathy. Aided by a superb quartet of performances, it is – again – magnificent. Jason Hughes is terrifying and terrifyingly believable as Rick, David Moorst’s spiky, slender Liam is utterly heartbreaking as the boy increasingly willing to do anything for his da, Morfydd Clark’s Jen nails the too-late awareness that all is not what it seems here and Siwan Morris fleshes out the underwritten Suze very well, in all her tragic delusion. "
1469,1469,Ought To Be Clowns,02/04/2014,mag9l,Pests, Royal Court,"One of the first things that strikes you about Vivienne Franzmann’s new play Pests is the extraordinary use of language. Much like Eugene O’Neill in plays like Anna Christie, it is written in densely packed dialect – in this case a modern street slang – which looks near-impenetrable on the page but in the hands of such extraordinary performers like Sinéad Matthews (who delivers the line quoted above), it has the currency of real life, an authenticity that speaks from the battered, neglected heart. Matthews plays Pink, a drug addict who welcomes her heavily pregnant sister Rolly, Ellie Kendrick, into her squat on her release from prison. Whilst inside Rolly has gotten clean and is determined to take advantage of a job opportunity on an ex-offenders scheme in a hotel but Pink just wants to get the party started again, trying to obliterate the painful memories of the care system that treated her much worse than her little sister. And as they pull in different directions, their inextricably complex relationship binds them ever closer. This destructive cycle of co-dependency, or sibling bond depending on how you want to look at it, is superbly drawn, hypnotically compelling even if we are forced to look through our fingers at the relentless horror of the situation. Franzmann has worked closely with co-producers Clean Break who commissioned the piece and it shows, there’s a deep emotional intelligence at work here that refuses to demonise the individual but rather furiously indicts the system that just chews them up and leaves them adrift in a society that largely doesn’t care. That’s not to say they’re not culpable too – Matthews (surely an actress destined for a huge future) brilliantly depicts the edgy temperament of Pink, unable to ever sit still and far too easily drawn to the dark, horrendously dark, places to which addiction drives her. And Kendrick offers an adroit counterweight as the (slightly) more balanced one, able to visualise a more positive future even if the baggage of the past is a huge obstacle in the way. Desperate and raw, Pests does much to elucidate how hard it can be to escape vicious cycles once they have started. Credit too must go to the creative team. Joanna Scotcher’s cluttered design suggests a childlike sense of play smashed up against the harsh realities of adulthood with its piles of dirty mattresses and sofas; Fabiana Piccioli’s stark lighting marries well with Kim Beveridge’s hallucinatory video work which explores the disintegration of Pink’s psyche; and Lucy Morrison corrals every element together into one of the more brutally effective pieces of theatre of the year so far."
1470,1470,Ought To Be Clowns,14/03/2016,mag9l,Miss Atomic Bomb, St James,"Atomic bombs derive their destructive power from nuclear fission, when atoms split after being bombarded with other particles, and there’s a certain sense of random elements being thrown together in Miss Atomic Bomb, in the hope of reaching some kind of critical mass. Comedy gangsters, tap-dancing routines, comedy bank managers, dead sheep, comedy zucchini, pigs in clothes, comedy transvestites, hoedowns, comedy rabbi costumes, a Strallen and a character with a ridiculous surname because you can get a song out of it. Put them altogether and what do you get? A show that’s either a bomb or a blast. Full disclosure, I saw a preview and I’m given to believe that a lot of work has happened to the show in the last couple of days, which is only natural for a new musical. For me though, the show feels fundamentally flawed in really not knowing what it wants to be. Writers Adam Long, Gabriel Vick and Alex Jackson-Long throw together satire and slapstick uneasily as a desperate Las Vegas hotel manager arranges the Miss Atomic Bomb beauty pageant to drum up tourist trade as the US military test their atomic arsenal in the Nevada desert. But it’s serious because the nuclear fallout is killing the livestock in the area. But it’s funny because farmgirl Candy can just win the pageant to get enough money to head over to California instead. But it’s serious because the hotel manager’s brother has deserted the army in protest at what they’re doing. But it’s funny because he’s got a courgette and a kippah to get away with it. Long co-directs with Bill Deamer, who also choreographs far too many inessential routines, but rarely does any sense of dramatic or musical purpose really emerge. The point at which Les Mis pastiches appear scrapes the barrel hard – you gotta get a gimmick but you gotta get your own. Frustratingly, the music actually improves in the second act but that only serves to heighten the dichotomy between score and book. Simon Lipkin and forthcoming Aladdin Dean John-Wilson share a gorgeously tender duet of brotherly love in ‘I’ll Stand With You’ but it bears no resemblance to the fraternal relationship as played out throughout the entire play. And for all the prettiness of the country and western-tinged songs that Candy gets to sing, Florence Andrews really shining here, they have no organic place in the story as it tears around the Vegas strip. "
1471,1471,Ought To Be Clowns,31/05/2014,mag9l,Between Us, Arcola,"Sarah Daniels’ new play for the Arcola opens with a cracking sequence that pokes fun at stereotypical theatregoers and set the scene intriguingly for what is to come. There’s something wonderfully subversive about Julia’s stand-up routine, especially before its true purpose really manifests itself, the forthrightness with which she muses about female sexuality has a delicious edge (although I’ll never hear ‘snack box’ the same way again) and it is almost a shame that there isn’t more of this taboo-busting chat alongside the outrageous liberties she later takes in taking inspiration from her work and life to make people laugh. For we soon find out that she is a therapist and we get to eavesdrop on two of her regular patients as they work through the issues plaguing them. Waitrose shopper Teresa is struggling with the realities of having adopted two troubled children, five star builder Dave is plagued with depression after the birth of his baby daughter, and even Julia herself is coming to terms with meeting the daughter she gave up for adoption long ago. As is often the way in plays such as these, the stories of these three are interlinked in ways they can’t even imagine and Daniels teases out the reveals with real skill, ensuring the level of Between Us never flags. She also cleverly keeps the majority of the play in monologue. We’re the audience for Julia’s stand-up and the therapist for the other two, which keeps us actively engaged in these engrossing stories. Only when Julia is trying to reconnect with her daughter are we the passive audience, but no less involved in wanting their issues to be amicably resolved. Daniels has much that is interesting to say about the nature of parent/child relationships and the responsibilities that we hold to others in our life, even after a long time has passed by. The difficulties inherent in adoption also rear their head in different ways, always thought-provoking in their frankness. It is a much over-used term but Between Us really does fall into the ‘darkly comic’ category in that it frequently manages to make you laugh out loud and wince at the same time. John Burgess’ production encourages a directness of approach that his cast revel in delivering. So Charlotte Cornwell works the audience expertly as if we were in her own comedy club, Callum Dixon’s affability draws us in closely but belies the darker places he ends up taking us to and Georgina Rich is heart-breakingly intense as the woman whose experience of motherhood has fallen so very short of what she, and society, had told her it would be. "

1473,1473,Ought To Be Clowns,20/03/2016,mag9l,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Pleasance,"It’s all in the name – the Reversed Shakespeare Company have set themselves up with the express intention of exploring and expanding gender roles by flipping the script and giving us Shakespeare’s male characters played as women, by women and vice versa. So instead of your Polonias and Malvolias, their debut production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream begins with Egeus and Hermia as a battling mother and son in the court of their Duchess, Theseus. It may take a moment of adjustment, not least when Helena bounds onto stage with a luscious red beard, but it sets the scene for an adventurous, interesting take on the play, that really does have a lot to say in its shifted sexual dynamics. How often do we get to see women being this forthright and dominant in their relationship, or men demurring modestly from a quickie in the woods? Or indeed for that matter (especially in light of The Painkiller and indeed the whole of farce as a genre), how rare it is to see women allowed to be this physically funny onstage. This is largely down to a strong set of performances from the lovers – Charlotte Mulliner’s assured Lysander is superb, squaring up to Cassie Webb’s prissy Demetrius in pursuit first of Matthew Maltby’s affecting Hermia and then Matthew McFetridge’s outraged Helena. Their four-way quarrel was one of the more entertaining I’ve seen in a good while and constantly made one think about the ways in which theatre so often reinforces gender norms. My only small cavil was with the inclusion of “Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex…”, its sentiments not sitting too well in McFetridge’s mouth however you slice it (though am I just supporting the patriarchy myself now? Dammit!). Director Laura Jasper has intelligently modified the text throughout and interestingly, opts for a more low-key Titania and Oberon than one might expect. Rather than their conflict being a truly elemental one, it feels more of a lover’s tiff – Kate Cavendish’s Oberon is less jealous than jokey, high-fiving Puck with glee – and so the gender swap having perhaps less potent effect here, McFetridge doubling as Titania effectively though. Samuel Wilde’s lo-fi, detritus-strewn set design comes into its own in this fairyland, its playfulness adding to the style along with Odinn Hilmarsson’s brooding soundscape.  The six women of the company have lots of fun as the Rude Mechanicals, opting for a chaotic comic presence that pleased me well, even if as a gentleman I am awfully afeared of a lion. Ailis Duff’s Bottom demonstrates a real developing gift for comedy and Cavendish’s Snout gave a hilariously scene-stealing Wall. The broadness here works well precisely because its in direct contrast to the considered intelligence and emotional depth of the lovers’ portrayal – you believe that Maltby’s Hermia doesn’t want to give it up just yet, not this way, that McFetridge’s Helena would feel in his friend’s shadow (and perhaps even under his spell), that Mulliner’s Lysander and all her ardour could be thus swayed by love-in-idleness. It’s beguiling stuff indeed."
1474,1474,Ought To Be Clowns,16/10/2012,Ian,The Revenger’s Tragedy, Hoxton Hall,"Technical difficulties around health and safety meant that Suba Das’ production of The Revenger’s Tragedy had to be rapidly reconceived from its intended promenade aspect but little can excuse shining a bright light into the eyes of part of the audience for 15 minutes. Thomas Middleton’s Jacobean blood-fest now sits still in the Victorian music hall surroundings of Hoxton Hall, but seriously lacks the basic thread of storytelling that such a complex play requires. Vindice is determined to wreak a terrible revenge on the duke who poisoned his beloved fiancée and doesn’t care who get sucked into his machinations, whether it is the corrupt extended family of the duke, or his own (slightly) more innocent relations. This is a barely comprehensible world of deep selfishness, punctuated with episodes of extreme violence and illicit lust, and so needs a strong directorial hand to try and impose if not sense, then at least an interpretation of great clarity and focused intent. Unfortunately, there’s a distinct lack of thematic continuity in the entire production as concepts are toyed with and then cast aside. Vindice’s initial role is almost of puppet-master as he controls almost every facet of the opening segment of the show but this is quickly forgotten as are the distorted video-screens and voiceovers; a dance interlude in the second half is awkwardly introduced and executed; Rachael A Smith’s design provides no real clues as to when this is actually set, the elusive impreciseness proving frustrating throughout."
1475,1475,Ought To Be Clowns,25/02/2019,Ian,Ladybones, VAULT Festival,"It takes real skill to write effectively about a subject without making your play ostensibly about that subject. A simplistic take on Sorcha McCaffrey’s Ladybones would be to call it an OCD play but that would be to deny its layers of subtleties and the depth of its actual subject matter which is far more wide-ranging. McCaffrey plays Nuala, a junior osteology archaeologist whose quietly ordered existence is thrown into disarray upon the discovery of a skeleton which turns out to be that of a young woman. Throwing herself into finding out the story of the victim, she starts to identify with her, a journey that pulls too hard on the thread of everything holding her together. For she does live with OCD and it is suffused throughout the script in the lightest of ways, a constant presence that sometimes bubbles to the surface but even when we don’t see it, it is there. Lucia Cox’s astute direction evokes this superbly, aided by Holly Ellis’ lighting work, probing the fine line between “being weird and being a weirdo”."
1476,1476,Ought To Be Clowns,10/10/2011,Ian,Soho Cinders, Queens Theatre,"Soho Cinders is a Stiles + Drewe show which has long been in development, 11 years since the original concept was devised, during which they’ve worked on Mary Poppins, the sadly departed Betty Blue Eyes and their new show Soapdish. But all the while, this modern-day gay retelling (of sorts) of the Cinderella tale has been burbling away, some of the songs were previewed at the A Spoonful of Stiles and Drewe concert in 2008 and subsequently released on CD – one in particular, ‘(They Don’t Make) Glass Slippers’ becoming a favourite amongst young male singers, Gareth Gates being my particular favourite rendition. Having the book retweaked one more time by Elliot Davis, Stiles + Drewe decided to launch the show in a one-off concert version at the Queen’s Theatre, in an evening in support of, and maintaining their long-standing connection with, the Teenage Cancer Trust, following last year’s concert at Wilton’s Music Hall. Our Cinderella is Robbie, a young Londoner who works as an escort in order to fund his way through law school so he can contest his mother’s will which apparently left her coffee shop to his wicked stepsisters. Our prince is James Prince, a prospective London mayoral candidate, who has a glamorous fiancée but as it turns out, has been conducting a secret affair with Robbie, although unaware of his other activities. When they are flung together unexpectedly at a fundraising party, secrets tumble out, truths are exposed and though no shoes are left behind (it’s a phone instead), the fairytale ending does not necessarily seem guaranteed. Though it was advertised as a concert performance, it was nice to see that a lot of effort had gone into the show, director Jonathan Butterell staging quite a few of scenes, using the company well and employing Drew McOnie to introduce some sharp and witty choreography to some of the numbers which brought the added bonus of the wonderful Ebony Molina amongst others. And George Stiles led a brilliant sounding 15-person orchestra in playing what has to be one of the most accessible scores that this writing team has come up with. Whether it is writing in a modern-day context for once, or the freedom to be as funny as they like (my companion thought the humour was quite panto-like, I wasn’t quite as sure), but it is packed with catchy, witty, perfectly-rounded nuggets of musical genius. Full ensemble numbers like Old Compton Street and Who’s That Boy? fizzled with energy and great moves and the refrain of You Shall Go The Ball is still working its way round my brain, the best of ways! And to round it all off in the best of ways was the all-star casting which made this a genuinely superb evening, perfectly framed by Sandi Toksvig’s dry narration, full of razor-sharp quips. Jos Slovick made a very appealing Robbie, working against stereotype well and sounding excellent, matched superbly by the tall drink of water that is Michael Xavier as James Prince, the bisexual would-be mayor whose online hook-up is threatening to turn into something more as captured in the tender Gypsies of the Ether. There was great work from the ladies in their life too: the sparky Amy Lennox as Velcro, Robbie’s wisecracking childhood friend who gets some of the funniest lines and the glorious Hannah Waddingham as James’ fiancée Marilyn, in a part that feels underwritten but does come to life in the second act as we discover she knows more than she is letting on. Their duet Let Him Go towards the end of the show is a beautiful song, all the more powerful for its understated performance from both ladies. As befits the panto origins, there’s a pair of ugly sisters who provide the comic highlight of the show with their filthy humour and their show-stopping number I’m So Over Men. Beverly Rudd and Suzie Chard literally brought the house down with their potty-mouthed brassiness, making us laugh so much they had to perform the song again as an encore so it could be re-recorded. David Bedella made a highly effective Machiavellian campaign manager, his powerful vocal showcased well in Spin and there were small but effective parts for Sharon D Clarke and Clive Carter in an ensemble that shone throughout the evening. As an occasion, Soho Cinders was a brilliant Sunday evening in the theatre and the decision to record the evening – the CD can already be pre-ordered from Dress Circle – is a canny one, meaning that those unable to make this show will be able to hear it and continue to show it love. As a piece of theatre, I found that there was still some work to be done on the book which doesn’t really hang together too well, especially in the second half where there’s an improbable rush to resolve every single storyline. I suppose part of my doubt comes with not being entirely sure what the show is trying to be: a piece of genuine musical theatre, a pantomime of sorts, or indeed a mixture of both. There’s something lovely in the straight-up (no pun intended) depiction of a cutely mis-matched same-sex love affair which made me want to take it a bit more seriously than the overly neat ending allowed, with the speediest piece of legal advice I’ve ever seen. I hope then that this remains something of a work-in-progress but also that a future life for the show is soon forthcoming. The CD will be a must-buy once it is released since it is such a very strong score sung excellently and who knows, you might even hear me laughing on it. Given the reception last night, the audience is definitely ready for Soho Cinders here in London, surely it’s just a case of finding the right (Soho) venue for it! oui c'est géniale qui ont fait; Stiles + Drewe a décidé de lancer le spectacle dans une version concert exceptionnel au Théâtre de la Reine, http://blanchirlesdents.org/dans une soirée à l'appui, et le maintien de leur longue liaison avec le Teenage Cancer Trust, la suite de concerts l'an dernier à Music Hall de Wilton."
1477,1477,Ought To Be Clowns,02/06/2010,Ian,After the Dance, National Theatre,"After the Dance is one of Terence Rattigan’s lesser-performed plays; its less-than-stellar original reception due to its unfortunate timing, opening in 1939 as it did, meant it was a relative commercial failure. Rattigan’s personal antipathy to the piece because of this led to the play being excluded from anthologies of his work and it is only really after his death that it has been considerably re-appraised and now considered one of his masterpieces (according to the National Theatre website anyway!). A cast of 25, under Thea Sharrock’s direction, tell the story of a group of wealthy London socialites, and their hanger-ons, as they set about the business of partying and just generally having a right rollicking good old time. The year is 1938 though, and these are the people who survived the horrors of the Great War, bright young things of the 20s unwilling to let go of the illusions of their youth even as the world tumbles towards another major conflict. At the centre of pile of empties are the Scott-Fowlers, Joan and David the ultimate party couple who got married for kicks and giggles yet find themselves 12 years later still together. Their Mayfair apartment is populated by their friends only interested in maintaining the partying status quo of gin-soaked debauchery, but some of the younger generation are also present, a nephew is helping David with his fruitless pursuit to be taken seriously as a historian and his meddlesome sweetheart who is intent on rescuing David from himself, regardless of the impact it will have on his marriage. Rattigan portrays with accuracy the vagaries of human behaviour, specifically the emotional repression, the reserved English nature which crippled true human interaction and lead to catastrophic results (indeed, one could argue it is best exemplified in Chamberlain’s insistence on the appeasement policy.) And in locating his drama in this interwar period, events take on an epic tragic weight, it is hard not to feel something for these people, no matter how obnoxious they get, recovering from one world war only to find themselves headed inexorably towards another. Nancy Carroll is heartbreakingly good as the brash Joan whose feelings for her husband have matured into a deep unspoken love she is unable to articulate; I’ve never seen Adrian Scarborough funnier than as the ever-present sozzled John, the best friend and permanent house guest who never leaves but possessed of a startling perceptive acuity and the deepest understanding of what it really going on and Benedict Cumberbatch captures the moral apathy of David, in love with the idea of things more than the reality and ultimately the most emotionally repressed of them all. But there’s excellent work throughout the ensemble, John Heffernan has a wonderfully fresh appeal as the beaverish nephew, Jenny Galloway has great fun as the acerbic Miss Potter, Lachlan Nieboer’s awkward Cyril is a hoot and Pandora Colin’s flapper friend Julia is belly-achingly, scene-stealingly hysterical with a short but memorable appearance in each of the acts. It’s three hours long but it really does fly by. There could be a little trimmed from the first act I feel, it is generally quite static and once the milieu has been established it does drag on a little but this can easily be tightened up before opening night. Costumes are great, Carroll’s red party dress is spectacular, the unchanging set is sumptuously mounted and the use of supernumaries lends a nice authenticity to the riotous party scene, Leo Staar taking the opportunity to show off his perfectly pert buttocks. Generally speaking, this was an astonishingly accomplished performance for a first preview of such a large production and I believe it can only get better. The combination of Rattigan’s clarity of storytelling, Thea Sharrock’s unfussy direction and a stellar cast is just magical. Another five star show so soon after All My Sons? Just maybe…! Must agree, also saw the performance on Tue.1st June, it was hard to believe that it was the first preview, and not well into it's run.The cast appeared completely comfortable in their roles, with special mention to Adrian Scarborough, Benedict Cumberbatch, Nancy Carroll and John Hefferman. The set and lighting were perfect as was the direction, the party scene was tremendous.The despair and self loathing of the characters concealed beneath the shallow, careless manner is subtlely portrayed.This production is a real delight, a perfect little jewel to be enjoyed at the NT before it transfers to the WE (I wonder?) I'm glad someone else loved it as much as I did, I did feel I was sticking my neck out a bit but as I thought about it more afterwards, the more I realised how fantastic I thought it was. I wonder what the newspaper critics will make of it though. Spot on Ian-we saw it last night and enjoyed every minute of it. What an excellent review. Talking of spots, the only bug-bear was one of the spotlights during the last act was shining onto the mirror over the fireplace which then  was blinding two of us in row E stalls central seats! Nobody's mentioned the on-stage blowjob so far, which is a shame!  Thought this play wsa practically perfect – three hours sped by. Saw the play last Tuesday a matinee performance. Absoluted loved it. The best acting I have seen for years and great to see smoking on stage!"
1478,1478,Ought To Be Clowns,19/11/2014,Ian,Macbeth, National Youth Theatre of Great Britain at the Ambassadors Theatre,"There’s something a little ironic about NYT’s assurance that this is the “only West End showing of Macbeth this autumn” when I will have seen 3 productions of the Scottish play this month. Sure, the muddy paths of Clapham Common and the dusty hall of the London Welsh Centre might fall a little short of the shabby chic of the Ambassadors Theatre but it is a clear indication of the enduring popularity of this programming choice which forms one third of a rep season which also includes Private Peaceful and a modern telling of Dorian Gray in Selfie. And sure enough, Ed Hughes’ concise adaptation offers up the best of the bunch for the season, the bold thematic vision working well and releasing the play from any dusty RP connotations. From the outset as Grace Chilton borrows the spirit of Alan Cumming’s iconic Emcee to the haunting presence of Lady Macbeth’s ghost during a key moment, Hughes’ liberating attitude (he also directs) makes this a rapid-fire success which pays its own tribute to the WWI anniversary as well as crackling with youthful energy."
1479,1479,Ought To Be Clowns,03/08/2011,Ian,Rattigan’s Nijinsky, Chichester Festival Theatre,"Rattigan’s Nijinsky is something of a companion piece to the production of The Deep Blue Sea with which this is playing in rep at the Chichester Festival Theatre and sharing much of its cast. Looking to make their own unique tribute in the centenary year of Rattigan’s death, new pieces have been commissioned to play alongside his plays and here, Nicholas Wright has embroidered a story around the mystery of Rattigan’s 1974 unproduced and unpublished screenplay about ballet dancer Nijinsky and his passionate affair with Ballets Russes impresario Diaghilev. Having been able to examine images of the original work, Wright has incorporated scenes into his own play, so we get to see Rattigan’s version of the tumultuous love affair between the older Diaghilev and his protégé, the man often cited as one of the greatest dancers ever, and the strain it was placed under due to Nijinsky’s mental fragility, something exacerbated (or even caused by?) falling into marriage with a woman. These scenes are interspersed with a modern-day (1974) narrative with an ailing Rattigan sequestered in his suite at Claridges and having to deal with Nijinsky’s widow, Romola, who is virulently objecting to his version of the events of her earlier life. Underlying everything is Rattigan’s private homosexuality – something further pointed up by the pairing with the coded desire of The Deep Blue Sea – and the dramatic drive of the contemporary strand, such as it exists, is around Romola’s threats to blackmail Rattigan into silence, holding the knowledge of his sexuality over him whilst he struggles with the idea of coming out and thus being known, button-holed, as a gay writer. Malcolm Sinclair captures something of this torment, self-medicating with both potions and J+B, reduced to a stammering boy by the inquisitive nature of his redoubtable mother and looking on with longing as the Nijinsky scenes play out around him. The play didn’t quite work for me though, unable to really delve into issues in either strand. Nijinsky remained a very elusive character, we see how his choreographic gift brought to him to life, but his marriage and descent into insanity are both very quick and rather unexplained. Likewise, we don’t really get to explore Rattigan, his interactions are quite limited from within his hotel room and only in flashes do we see something of the man behind the image: the heartbreaking phone call to the BBC, the growing flirtation with the gruff bellboy. Too much of the dialogue feels stilted and artificial, like what one would expect Rattigan to say as a character in one of his own plays, when something more visceral is needed (and dramatic license invoked if necessary). Philip Franks’ production has a strong cast: Jonathan Hyde makes for a brilliantly exuberant and charismatic Diaghilev, present in both time zones and the figure Rattigan longs to be, something I wish had been played up more; Joseph Drake did well at portraying the elusive and enigmatic Nijinsky if not quite getting the dancer’s grace, and was great fun as the twinkle-eyed flirty bellhop; Faye Castelow and Susan Tracy struggled a little with the younger and older versions of Romola, characterised so unsympathetically. A lithe ensemble added intermittent energy and interest, but ultimately it all felt a little inconsequential.   What did Rosemary do? I'm intrigued….."
1480,1480,Ought To Be Clowns,27/08/2011,Ian,The Faith Machine, Royal Court,"I wavered about the status of this review/not-a-review as the performance of the Royal Court’s The Faith Machine that I saw had to be delivered under house lights without any of Neil Austin’s lighting design since a heavy downpour in the afternoon had put the lighting rig out of action which was a shame as Mark Thompson’s design looks intriguing. Indeed, the rain continued to drip onto the stage throughout the show and so the actors had a fair amount to contend with whilst still working things out in this preview. We did still pay full price though so I am not feeling totally forgiving: so I’ve called it a review, but the focus will mainly be on the play itself rather than the production. Alexi Kaye Campbell scored a massive hit with his first play The Pride back in 2008 and the play recently had its regional premiere which I was able to catch in Sheffield and I was vastly impressed by the maturity of the writing and its refusal to settle for easy answers. Thus the anticipation for The Faith Machine was quite high, especially with a cracking cast like the one put together here for Jamie Lloyd’s production. The play has a sprawling epic range: its six scenes shifting in a non-linear fashion from various points between 1998 and 2011 and from New York to the UK and a remote Greek island. At the heart of its narrative are big questions about what it means to believe in something, whether love, religion or a capitalist lifestyle and what people are willing to sacrifice for it or more aptly, at what point will they draw the line. Whether it is the thorny issue of homosexuality in the Anglican Church, or working with a company with an extremely dubious ethical record, Kaye Campbell here makes explicit a connection between personal and the wider social responsibility we all carry. This he does with a fair amount of wit and pointed humour as the play opens on Tom and Sophie’s troubled relationship, her extreme liberal principles at odds with his decision to leave his idealism behind and as we flick quickly back to their beginnings, we see the influence of her father, an Anglican bishop. These opening scenes set up the premise well, the broad canvas suggesting a complex layering of the arguments, but I have to admit to being disappointed with the way it played out in the end. The thrust of the play ends up being pretty straight-forward and disappointingly unambiguous in its message. Indeed, the characterisation of one lead character in particular feels far too one-dimensional and more like an ideological position as opposed to a living person. This in turn has a serious impact on the emotional heft of the final act for me which ultimately felt like a waste of the potential of the play which opens with hints of metaphysical promise but ends up really rather prosaic. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistically high, perhaps it was the odd nature of a performance with a constant drip just inches from our faces, but I ended up disappointed upon leaving the theatre. The tangential incorporation of 9/11 feels a little forced as a catalyst and something of an unnecessary addition; the proximity of the 10th anniversary perhaps leading this? It is largely well acted: Ian McDiarmid is predictably brilliant as the bishop wrestling with his more conservative colleagues and later with his own internal demons and the incredibly hard-working Kyle Soller has a mighty good go at Tom, forced to deal with a decade of recriminations as a result of his choices: Hayley Atwell’s Sophie was the character I had much difficulty with, her performance not quite able to overcome the limitations I saw in the writing. There’s also some canny doubling from Jude Akuwudike and a brilliant comic but warming performance from Bronagh Gallagher as a fabulously blunt Ukrainian housekeeper. If you get to see the production in its full glory, do let me know what you thought of it. I’ll be interested to see what others make of it, as well as hearing what you think of the writing. I thought it was funnier than you give it credit for but agree that it comes as a disappointment after the excellent Pride.Maybe you should have asked for an exchange to a different night… I saw this play last night, 26th Sept and found it irritating beyond belief. Didactic, preachy with some truly clunky dialogue. Trying to make sense of its aims proved impossible really. Way overlong for the subject matter – it all could have been said in half the time – it creaked excruciatingly slowly towards its contrived climax. The two young leads (Kyle Soller and Hayley Atwell)were sometimes absolutely impossible to understand as they gabbled their way through the evening. Ian McDiarmid and Jude Akuwidike impressed but the direction often looked like a production from a weekly repertory company. I very much enjoyed the play, took the didactic elements of the script on the chin, and was actually quite moved by the end despite it killing off any ambiguity. I must just be a softy! But I am glad to read that you too felt Hayley Atwell’s Sophie could have been better. Both her lines and her performance felt rather wooden; it was difficult to warm to her in the way that Agatha suggested at the end we should have, and the clunky lines gave her little room to make arguments seem genuine."
1481,1481,Ought To Be Clowns,18/09/2012,Ian,The Busy Body, Southwark Playhouse,"Miranda loves Sir George Airey but wants to make him work for her hand whilst fending off her lecherous guardian Sir Francis Gripe, whose son Charles is in love with Isabinda whose marvellously named mother Lady Jealous Traffic is determined to marry her off to a Spanish merchant. There’s also a monkey, or is there? Such is the set-up for The Busy Body, a 1709 period comedy by Susanna Centlivre which was one of the most popular plays of its day but has remained unproduced for over 100 years. Continuing their close relationship with the Southwark Playhouse, Red Handed Theatre have alternated emotionally devastating dramas (Palace of the End, Someone To Watch Over Me) with sparklingly refreshed Restoration comedies (The Rivals, The Belle’s Stratagem) to great effect and director Jessica Swale’s adroit adaptation looks set to continue that exceptionally strong run. What really makes it work though is the immense attention to detail. It is a comedy for sure, but one which is played true and so delivery remains deadpan throughout, no matter how random the plot turns – Michael Lindall’s Spanish dress and raised eyebrow as the disguised Charles the best example here, though Alexandra Guelff’s (Miranda) determined protection of her monkey comes a close second. And comic flourishes abound at every turn – Ella Smith’s Isabinda in particular is fearsomely, inventively funny in every single scene she is in and Henry Shields doubles to brilliant effect as Charles’ man Whisper and Lady Jealous’ butler – and the fourth wall is well and truly smashed (shy wallflower types might want to avoid the front row!) Directly addressing the audience is nothing new but the conviction and skill with which it is essayed here, both when being played for laughs and cleverly also in the more tenderly emotional moments, means that every beat seeks to involve and include us all. And though this may be the third foray into the world of Restoration comedy for Swale, it is clear to see that this is a director honing and refining their craft, no lazy retreads here. The knowing post-modern touch of the arrangements of current pop songs has gone, replaced with an original soundtrack of songs composed by Swale and MD Harriet Oughton which removes the slight archness with something that feels integrally connected to the production and the minstrels’ consequent interjections are just delightful, amusing and tuneful. There’s also a greater confidence in the extent to which the audience are folded into the warm embrace of the play, a greater trust invested in us to be sure but one which pays dividends in the connection and engagement that it engenders.  Simon Kenny’s deceptively simple set design of revolving triangular pillars keeps the stage remarkably uncluttered but also allows for moments of staging ingenuity – the way in which the two levels of a balcony scene are played is just hilarious yet brilliant, and leads to a witty pay-off with the final exit. And by the time the cast dance their exuberant jig that follows the sung epilogue, a smile will surely have cracked on the hardest of faces. Joyous and warm, frivolous and funny, The Busy Body is a charming delight and highly recommended. Plus you get to see from where the term “monkey business” may have originated, what more could you want. "
1482,1482,Ought To Be Clowns,26/05/2013,Ian,The Bear, Ovalhouse,          
1483,1483,Ought To Be Clowns,31/10/2010,Ian,Blue/Orange, Arcola,"Joe Penhall’s Blue/Orange is the penultimate production to be played in the main space at the Arcola Theatre before their enforced move to new premises. Celebrating its tenth anniversary with its first London revival, Tiata Fahodzi, a UK theatre company set up to provide an African cultural perspective to British theatre, have reworked this three-hander into an all-female production, changing the gender of all three of its protagonists. This is a review of the final preview performance. Set in October 2002 in an NHS psychiatric hospital in London, Juliet, a young black woman, has been diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder and is coming to the end of her period of commitment. Emily, her psychiatrist who is in her first year of practising has her doubts about Juliet’s suitability to be released, suspecting that she may have schizophrenia and has invited her superior, Hilary, to witness her final interview with her patient with the hope of having her recommitted. What we soon come to realise though is that Juliet’s interests are not necessarily at the forefront of the minds of the doctors as there is much more at stake here for these two women. It is an incisive look at race and mental illness and how equipped our health service is to deal with cultural sensitivities in a time of rising political correctness but also in the diagnostic procedures that have been worked up at a time before ethnic considerations came into play. To be honest, I enjoyed the show less when it was investigating psychological diagnostic practices in considerable depth and more when it was about the sparring between the two doctors, throwing up questions about academic advancement versus professional ethics and the power held by supervisors over the careers of their juniors. Schlesinger captures the arrogance of the chain-smoking, would-be professor beautifully and relishes her verbal battles with Esther Hall’s idealistic newbie who is amusingly frustrated at both the manoeuvrings of her superior and the unpredictable randomness of her patient. I wasn’t convinced by Ayesha Antoine as the patient though: her Juliet is such an impenetrable character and I think it needs more insight, more subtlety in painting the nuances so that the question of her sanity is always in, well, question. I am sure it is hard to play mental illness effectively and this was a preview, but it needs more ambiguity here to give the requisite weight to the ostensibly sane passages that accompany the manic sequences where she is extremely convincing. One of the best things about the Arcola has been the sheer flexibility of its space and the consistently inventive ways in which pieces have been staged and ULTZ’s design here is no different for being ingenious. He has constructed a full psychiatrist’s office around which the audience sit on all four sides, peering in through the window spaces as in an observation chamber. This allows for Jo Joelson to initially use the harsh over-bright office lighting we’re all so familiar with to present the first act and then subtly introducing variations as the action and motivations of all concerned becomes increasingly murky, all the while keeping a spotlight on the bowl of oranges, Juliet’s perception of which lends the show its title. The only bum note was the thumping African music which played before the show started and in the interval, it felt like the only real time that this African perspective was pushed into this production and came across as intrusive. As a rather random aside, this ended up being one of those occasions where I wished I hadn’t read the programme before the show started. Being made so aware of the show’s award-winning pedigree raised my expectations but in mentioning its stellar original cast of Bill Nighy, Andrew Lincoln and Chiwetel Ejiofor (which initially provoked major play-envy in me) it doesn’t really help in establishing this an independent production. As it was, I couldn’t help but see Bill Nighy-isms in Schlesinger’s performance despite having only just learned five minutes previously that he was in the original production and that the role was written specifically for him. So ultimately, a slightly underwhelming experience for me. I imagine that this production will hold more interest for people who saw the original all-male cast as the contrasting dynamics should be most interesting to compare and I will be interested to read what people have to say about what, if any, difference it made. Coming to it for the first time though, it didn’t really feel like an award-winning play as it came across as slightly unbalanced with a weak second act and a propensity for unnecessary verbiage which sometimes dulls the rapier-sharp dialogue that is threaded throughout. And if you ask me, those oranges are definitely orange. The set was Pieces of Vincent turned inside out. Luckily I saw the original nad can totally understand the Bill Nighy comparisons.  I was surprised how my reactions to, and allegiances with, the characters changed with the change in gender.  I will be interested to hear what others think. It only only an inversion of Pieces of Vincent in that the perspective was the other way round. It's a completely different set though."

1485,1485,Ought To Be Clowns,22/05/2020,Ian,The Understudy,,"Narrator Stephen Fry takes us through the journey of Stephen McQueen (no relation!) as he prepares to understudy a hunky young actor in the West End and espies an opportunity to collude with the 12th sexiest man in the world to allow him to philander away and let Stephen chase the stardom that has eluded his career so far.  There’s no two ways about it – this is a (radio) play for people who love the theatre, as it is jam-packed with jokes and jabs about actors, directors, the rehearsal process, theatrical agents, critics, the trend for site specific theatre and more beside. Russell Tovey is perfectly suited to the role of Stephen and even if the female characters are less well-written, Sheila Atim, Emily Atack and Sarah Hadland all impress."
1486,1486,Ought To Be Clowns,09/04/2014,mag9l,In the Vale of Health – Michael, Hampstead Downstairs,"A cycle of four interlinked Simon Gray plays might have seemed a curious enterprise for the Hampstead Theatre but it is one that has paid rich dividends before even a curtain had been raised. The run in the downstairs space sold so well that a transfer upstairs to the main house was quickly announced for In the Vale of Health, four plays which feature the same characters in the same situation but making different decisions – Japes, Japes Too, Michael and Missing Dates. The play that started it all off is Japes but in the mad rush to get the highly bargainous multi-deal that worked out at a fiver a show, all thoughts of scheduling went out of the window and so I’ll be seeing Japes third and the show that started off my experience was Michael, the one that Gray wrote third in the sequence of exploring the potential worlds of these characters. We were told that the plays could be watched in any order though I can’t help but wonder if seeing Japes first might not have been a better idea.  For though Michael was enjoyable to watch, at 80 minutes long it presupposes quite a lot about who these people are, exactly how their relationships tick, and the significance of certain key events. Michael and Jason (known as Japes) are brothers who are both academically inclined and who both love the same woman Anita. Here though, it is Michael whose career has taken off and who got the girl, with Japes’ alcoholism taking a heavy toll, not least on Anita’s daughter Wendy, whose paternity it turns out isn’t quite clear cut. It is fascinating stuff and compellingly acted in Tamara Harvey’s production which definitely benefits from the intimate in-the-round setting designed by Lucy Osborne. Gethin Anthony and Jamie Ballard as the brothers, Laura Rees as the woman between them and Imogen Doel as one or the other’s daughter all flourish in the microscopic atmosphere even if the experience of watching this felt like starting a giant jigsaw puzzle when one isn’t even sure which way up the pieces should go. "
1487,1487,Ought To Be Clowns,05/10/2011,Ian,Joseph, Churchill Theatre Bromley,"I don’t really remember a time when theatre wasn’t in my life. I was lucky enough to have parents and aunts who took me to see shows from an early age (indeed I heard Blood Brothers from my mother’s womb!) and so I caught the bug early. And of those shows that I saw as a young’un, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat is one that has recurred throughout my life whether watching Dad direct a school performance, being a part of my own primary school production, playing piano for both high school and drama group versions and of course going to see it multiple times at the theatre – I don’t actually recall if we saw Jason Donovan but I do remember Philip Schofield and Darren Day, whoop! Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat has become something of a mainstay for touring theatres, it comes and goes from the West End yet Bill Kenwright’s tour has lasted for over 20 years due to its enduring appeal with audiences of all ages across the entire nation, not least this reviewer who remembers seeing both Philip Schofield and Darren Day. Latest to take the loincloth is Keith Jack who plays the biblical Joseph, a confident young man whose favourite status with his father does not go down well with his 11 brothers, especially after he receives the gift of a marvellous coat, and once banished from his homeland, only his dream interpretation skills can save him from a life of servitude. Jack came second to Lee Mead in the BBC show Any Dream Will Do and what felt like a tacit recognition of the correctness of that decision, he was employed on Kenwright’s touring production but as the Narrator. One assumes he has earned sufficient spurs to take top billing now but on this performance, I’m not convinced it is that successful a move. He simply doesn’t radiate the star quality needed for a leading man, his cheekiness suits the younger Joseph well but doesn’t possess the gravitas to show the growth of maturity for the later scenes, his stage presence sorely lacking. More importantly, his vocal performance was quite disappointing: vitally underpowered at key solo moments, often overwhelmed by the ensemble and orchestra in group numbers, Jack is also guilty of a criminal amount of mumbling. He is shown up by the strength of the company around him, especially with the brothers being particularly well cast and exuding bucketfuls of personality. Their first half numbers incorporate energetic choreography, powerful vocals and a great sense of wit that is the saving grace of this production. Quite why the choice is then made to suck all the fun out of ‘These Canaan Days’ with a dour melancholy rendition, oddly led by Henry Metcalfe’s Jacob, I don’t know. But I enjoyed Ryan Gibb’s Reuben, Shaun McCourt’s Issacher and Kevin Grogan’s naïf Benjamin in a very strong grouping. Adam Jarrell makes a very appealing Pharoah whose Song of the King bops along perfectly and Jennifer Potts’ Narrator has a sweet charm matched by a tirelessly impressive voice. The choir made up from Bright Sparks Performers Theatre and Dance Academy also deserve special mention, their choral overture to Act II, is just charming. Being so familiar with the show also has its minor downside as it is nigh on impossible not to compare productions and revivals. One ends up with preferences for certain arrangements and aspects of songs and of course not all of them remain in the show. For me, the gospel version of ‘Go Go Go Joseph’ is far inferior to the disco one (I love the clapping!), removing the Narrator’s small contribution to the final Any Dream Will Do feels like a mistake, especially with Jack’s delivery here and I just do not understand the current trend for putting an interpretative reading on ‘Close Every Door’ – the line “If my life were important I, would ask if I live or die” should rhyme not be garbled into trying to make grammatical sense! But some choices are right too: losing the recently added Pharoah song ‘King of my Heart’ is the right move and keeping the way in which the first verse of ‘Any Dream Will Do’ is directed at Jacob adds a lovely layer of unexpected emotion to this overly familiar song."
1488,1488,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2012,Ian,Much Ado About Nothing, Noël Coward Theatre,"Transferring into the Noël Coward theatre, Iqbal Khan sets his RSC production of Much Ado About Nothing in modern-day Delhi, as a fitting counterpart to the African-dictator-led take on Julius Caesar which is now touring the UK after its London run. It’s a lengthy take on the play which does little by way of apparent editing, which is mighty impressive given the strength of the vision here, but it turns out the commonalities with contemporary India make this a great (arranged) marriage which is full of interesting scene readings which make this an intellectual, as well as visceral, pleasure. I found lots of to love, but particularly what had been done with the watch scenes, normally something tolerated with gritted teeth. Here, they are a group of social misfits, almost Napoleon Dynamite-inspired and it really really works, mainly because of the straightness of the bat with which the actors play it. We’re always laughing with, and not at them and they’re never played as stupid – in fact, something rather touching emerges from their determination of purpose. Niraj Chag’s music is also something wondrous to behold. Vivid, sensuous, powerful, it richly enhances the whole production and the six musicians who play throughout the show get a well-deserved bow at the end. Syal’s Beatrice has quite the melancholy heart which makes her a rather emotive figure from the outset – she refuses wedding proposals with a resigned kindness, her pseudo-motherly relationship with Amara Khan’s feisty Hero is beautifully played and spills out into the correct level of cold fury as events play out. Her relationship with Paul Bhattacharjee’s Benedick is interestingly played, a slow-burning relationship even by these standards as the connection between the pair is something that gradually builds rather than being immediately convincing. This means the gulling scenes don’t have quite the impact one might expect, Beatrice is particularly ill-served this time round as well, but their eventual union is as heart-rending and beautiful as one could hope for. There’s interesting work in the ensemble too: I loved Robert Mountford’s Panditji, a youthfully warm take on Friar Francis, Anjana Vasan’s mostly mute maid has some good funny business and I also liked Kulvinder Ghir’s Borachio and Chetna Pandya’s forthright Margaret.  Both of us on the night felt that the second half was weaker – too long and lacking in pace (and to be honest, I didn’t care much for Madhav Sharma’s Leonato) but it soon picks up to a rousing finale. Tom Piper’s design is cleverly put together, allowing for visual splendour in many scenes, and Himani Dehlvi’s costumes just look gorgeous. The man who we chatted to in the interval, who’d previously seen it in Stratford, reckoned it was shorter, sharper and funnier this time round. Read into that what you will, but I really rather enjoyed it and found myself quite deeply moved. That's interesting, Ian. I sw it in Stratford and thought the second half considerably better than the first- felt much tighter, certainly."
1489,1489,Ought To Be Clowns,22/06/2017,Ian,Sweet Bird of Youth, Chichester Festival Theatre,"There’s something a little depressingly predictable about my inability to resist a neat bit of star casting – Marcia Gay Harden’s long-in-the-making UK theatrical debut being the guilty party here. It’s depressing because Tennessee Williams’ Sweet Bird of Youth is a play I wasn’t much of a fan of the one time I saw it before and the heart wasn’t beating any faster at the prospect of sitting through it once again. And maybe there’s an element of self-defeating prophecy at work because I was bored rigid by Jonathan Kent’s production here for Chichester Festival Theatre. A quiet audience (never seen the upper seats curtained off like that before) sweltered in the stifling atmosphere but sadly, there was no heat being generated on the stage of Anthony Ward’s distractingly-conceived design. Harden plays Alexandra del Lago, a fading Hollywood legend whose attempted comeback has ended in ignominy at, has fled the premiere of a movie on which all her hopes were pinned and as one is liable to do, she picks up Chance Wayne, a handsome (younger) gigolo – Sense8’s Brian J Smith – who takes her to the Gulf of Mexico town of his birth. She wants to hide but he wants to fix the mistakes of his past, also vainly chasing a lost youth."
1490,1490,Ought To Be Clowns,13/03/2014,mag9l,Secret Theatre 4, Lyric Hammersmith,"Much of the buzz about Secret Theatre was the fact that audiences are kept in the dark about what it is they are booking for, placing their trust in the hands of an adventurous company looking to shake up the way theatre is created and commodified in this country. It makes for an entertaining evening, especially at the start as one waits to find out where in the theatre we’re going to be, and what delights are in store. As it was, I got to the end of Show 4 without having worked out much to be honest. The post-show information told me it was a play named Glitterland, an adaptation of John Webster’s The White Devil by Hayley Squires but not being a play I am familiar with, that proved of little assistance. In a densely woven plot, the striking aesthetic of the company – directed here by Ellen McDougall – takes you a long way but not quite far enough into a satisfying dramatic experience.  But it is a theatrical pleasure. There’s a huge amount of inventiveness at play: contemporary meshes up against the classic most pleasingly; snatches of popular songs are used wittily throughout; and the actors – already bold – are really growing into their ability to push boundaries and make the kind of creative choices we see too little in the UK. In this respect, it really is Leo Bill who is emerging as a bona fide star out of this illustrious group, his manipulative politico here a sensational performance."
1491,1491,Ought To Be Clowns,08/05/2014,mag9l,De Profundis, Leicester Square Theatre,"It is rather pleasing to see that the winner of a new musical theatre prize – inspiringly named the New Musical Project – is something that tests the boundaries of what we conventionally see labelled as musicals and hopefully will inspire others to consider more adventurous work. The winner of the inaugural prize was De Profundis, Paul Dale Vickers’ adaptation of the letter written by Oscar Wilde from his prison cell in Reading jail to his lover Lord Alfred Douglas, the man who helped to put him there. As such, it forms a musical monologue, just shy of an hour as Wilde recounts the state of affairs that has led him here, the hurts inflicted on him by Bosie, Bosie’s father and an unflinchingly moralistic society that has broken up his own family. But he also speaks of the power of love, and with typically philosophical élan, even forgiveness as he explores the more spiritual dimension of the punishment he has been forced to endure. It would certainly help to know a little of the circumstances in advance but this is powerful material regardless.  And Vickers’ interpretation really is inspired. The flowing elegance of much of the music, performed here by MD Michael Riley, reflects the melancholy mood of much of Wilde’s musings and is frequently hauntingly beautiful. Jagged interludes of anger add texture to the score and avoid any too-long passages of self-indulgence but to be honest, Alastair Brookshaw’s performance is so perfectly conceived that one could listen to his heartfelt contributions for a good deal longer into the night. Stuart Saint’s production wisely avoids trying to impersonate Wilde, so Brookshaw is liberated to simply sing as a man, any man who has loved and lost, indeed there’s little trace of the Wildean wit for which he is so famous now which only adds to the pathos of the whole piece. The minimal staging focuses us entirely on keenly-felt emotion and with writing this good from Vickers, there’s excellent reward in doing time at Leicester Square. "
1492,1492,Ought To Be Clowns,11/04/2019,Ian,West Side Story, Royal Exchange,"For an undoubted classic of the musical theatre, West Side Story really isn’t revived all that often but 2019 seems determined to rectify that. The Curve have announced it as their Christmas show, Ivo van Hove is reimagining it on Broadway, and Steven Spielberg is remaking the film for good measure. But getting the (beautifully balletic) jump on all of them is Manchester’s Royal Exchange, whose revival is the first to be performed with new choreography replacing the iconic moves of original director and choreographer Jerome Robbins. And only naturally, Sarah Frankcom’s production soars when it puts Aletta Collins’ new moves front and centre. They are certainly recognisably inspired by Robbins but there’s an unmistakeable freshness that is just beautiful to watch and there’s something great about the fact they’re all doing it in Converse. The repeated ronds de jambe are iconic in their own way, an emotional grace is suffused throughout, and hints of contemporary nod to the physicality of two warring gangs, coiled bodies poised on Anna Fleischle’s climbing frame design. Fleischle has also maximised the floor space of the Exchange to great effect, the aesthetic is pure dance and it works. Emphasising the youth of its leads, the central pair are cast well. As Maria, Gabriela Garcia has the kind of gorgeous sweet and open smile that you could imagine would bring about racial harmony in and of itself. And there’s no doubting Andy Coxon’s appeal as the genial Tony and together, they make a more than decent fist of the vocal challenges of Bernstein’s score (they don’t write ’em like this with proper soprano roles any more). ‘Tonight’ is blissful, their extended farewell supremely cute, ‘One Hand One Heart’ a dream of spine-tingling potential. Jocasta Almgill storms it as the ferociously passionate Anita. Her chemistry with Fernando Mariano’s Bernardo is off the scale and her affectionate takedown of her homeland in ‘America’ is superb, delivered here to Bree Smith’s Rosalia as opposed to the film’s reworked boys vs girls dynamic. Emily Langham’s small but crucial interventions as Anybodys shine throughout, particularly in the hushed beauty of ‘Somewhere’ and in a company full of exceptional movement, Michael Lin was a real stand-out for me. Credit too to MD Mark Aspinall whose top-notch band deliver Jason Carr’s new orchestrations with real skill. If I’m being brutally honest though, there is something about the second act which is a little difficult. As heady as teenage love can be, Maria forgiving her brother’s killer so easily and not only that, convincing Anita of her cause too, still feels a tough sell to me (she’s known him, what 48 hours at most?). And the Jets delivering the knockabout comedy of ‘Gee Officer Krupke’ on the spot where their leader was just killed is odd (as much a problem of the placing of the song in the show, I think). A comment on the mindless stupidness of boys in gangs perhaps, it doesn’t carry anywhere near enough anger to be a true anti-authority anthem."
1493,1493,Ought To Be Clowns,08/06/2017,Ian,Killology, Royal Court,"Strewth – Gary Owen’s Killology is a challenging watch – both structurally in its non-linear format and emotionally in its subject matter. Killology is a new gaming experience in which you score more points for the more ‘creative’ ways in which you torture and kill people and Owen’s play looks at the consequences of its success on Paul, who made it, and on father and son Alan and Davey. As in his previous play here Violence and Son, Owen is very much concerned with father and son relationships and the way in which they are revealed and reshaped here is one of the more fascinating aspects of Killology. The relationships and inter-relationships between these men and unseen others in their lives are richly drawn and deeply moving as layer upon layer of guilt and revenge play out."
1494,1494,Ought To Be Clowns,17/02/2011,Ian,Curtains, Arts Ed,"I could have been on the stage. Indeed I was, briefly as a shy teenager, but playing the piano for shows was a much more appealing option for me and so the world was left sadly bereft of what could have been the definitive Hamlet for our generation. Fortunately though, we are not lacking in acting talent and it is being well-nurtured at drama schools like Arts Ed where I went to catch this undergraduate production of Kander & Ebb’s Curtains. I was particularly keen to see it as the choreography was done by Andrew Wright, the gentleman who did the deed for my favourite musical of last year, Once Upon A Time At The Adelphi and I thought I might be able to convince him to give me a tap dancing lesson in the interval. Anyway, the show Curtains had a bit of a sad genesis. The original concept came from Peter Stone but he died before he completed the book so Rupert Holmes was brought in to rewrite it but when Fred Ebb also passed away before it had been finished, Holmes and Kander had to step in to finish off the lyrics. But it is not a melancholy show, far from it. It is a ‘musical comedy whodunit’, a send-up of murder mysteries set backstage at a theatre where a spectacularly bad leading lady is murdered after her first night in a Western version of Robin Hood. It is then up to a musical-theatre-loving detective to catch the murderer, save the show and fall in love with the girl of his dreams before the new opening night keeping the entire cast and crew and a rogue critic with far too much time on his hands, under suspicion. As Lt. Cioffi, crime solver second and musical theatre nerd first, Ben Irish really did impress with a strong comic portrayal of this officer of the law who is just ecstatic to be in the middle of all these show-people and getting to live out his dream, all the while edging closer to the truth of just whodunit. He sang and danced well too and developed a lovely chemistry with Rachel Moran’s appealing Niki, finding time to flirt outrageously in the midst of everything too. Will Keith came dangerously close to stealing the show though with his fey British twit of a director, highly amusing with a great affectation of brandishing his cane with its bird-head to great effect. But there were great performances throughout the cast with a nice strident ballsiness from Abiola Ogunbiyi as producer Carmen, determined to get the show on no matter what and Sinead Long shone as would-be starlet Bambi, delivering her moment in the sun perfectly, desperately trying to impress her mother. One couldn’t help but be impressed by the level of skill on display: the ensemble sounded great and danced like a dream, these are classes which are obviously going well! I have no idea how long it takes to learn a dance routine but for a run that was just a week long, this was seriously remarkable work. I would imagine that other things like how to deliver comedy lines and roll with the audience’s laughter are much harder to teach theoretically and so this would have been a great learning experience in that respect and a couple of performances could have done with being just a little more relaxed as I could feel their tenseness at times. All in all though, this was a great performance by a cracking team and a great introduction to this show of which I had heard lots but never seen. And though nothing is certain in this business they call show, I am pretty confident we will be seeing a fair few of these people in venues slightly more central than Turnham Green… I saw it on Broadway and laughed about half a dozen times in total. It seemed aimed at an age group two decades above mine! Thank You for your kind words Sir! Barnes x"
1495,1495,Ought To Be Clowns,04/04/2018,Ian,Love Me Now, Tristan Bates,"One of my favourite characters in early-season Dawson’s Creek was Abby. Allowed to walk on the wild side far more than any of the leads, she was a bright pop of colour in Capeside but because she liked a drink, she had to die. First-time-writer Michelle Barnette may not have intended this allusion but in this tale of casual sex gone awry, it was what sprung to mind. But as Love Me Now attempts to explore “the toxicity of casual dating”, maybe it is an appropriate reference. Her characters A (Alistair Toovey’s ripped cocksure man-child) and B (Helena Wilson’s Insta-loving professional woman) are engaged in the kind of no-strings affair of Tinder’s dreams, only things have gotten complicated. She wants more commitment, he just wants more head.  Is the heteronormative casual sex scene so incapable of defining no strings? Is the potential for mutually satisfying fun so outweighed by possible toxicity? Does rational behaviour – for both men and women – really fly out the door in the face of the societal imperative to be in a relationship? Straight people be crazy… It wouldn’t be quite so much of an issue if Barnette had identified a stronger dramatic throughline here, a clearer sense of what she’s trying to say. But as she experiments with form, as earlier scenes overlap and replay, Love Me Now becomes hazier and with the introduction of C (Gianbruno Spena), presenting a different form of problematic masculinity, its intent feels murkier than it necessarily need be."
1496,1496,Ought To Be Clowns,21/08/2010,Ian,Into the Woods, Open Air Theatre,"The final show in this year’s season at the Open Air Theatre in Regent’s Park is yet another entry into Stephen Sondheim’s anniversary calendar with a production of Into The Woods. And what a well-suited choice as the multi-level set sits in the real trees and bushes around the auditorium, swaying in the wind, leaves beginning to fall and providing the perfect backdrop for the show. Told by a narrator, here a young boy (Ethan Beer last night), the story mixes together characters from many familiar fairytales all living their stories as we know them, in their various searches for happiness, wealth, fulfilment, all their hearts’ desires and reaches the conclusions we have come to know as the characters secure their happy endings. However, this only takes us to the interval and the second half takes a decidedly darker turn as Sondheim and Lepine investigate what happens after ‘happy ever after’ and the dangers in having your wishes granted. This is quality casting at its best and it really does show. Just as some actors have a natural affinity for Shakespeare’s language, so too do some actors have an instinctive feel for Sondheim’s oeuvre and here we have two of the finest exponents of Sondheim’s work leading the cast in Jenna Russell and Hannah Waddingham. Russell provides the much needed emotional heart of the show as the Baker’s Wife, so poignantly honest and a sheer delight to watch, even when not singing, she’s a brilliantly reactive actress. And Waddingham effects a remarkable physical transformation from the hunched-over crone to a bewigged beauty, possessed of a stunning vocal clarity and an statuesque elegance. Amongst the ensemble, Helen Dallimore (to whom I will forever be grateful for Ernie Get Your Gun) as Cinderella and Michael Xavier, doing double duty as Cinderella’s Prince and the Wolf were both excellent, but Beverly Rudd’s bumptious Little Red Riding Hood was particularly scene-stealingly good, her attempts at skipping at me creased up every time. There’s even a brief vocal cameo from Dame Judi Dench as the Giant which she invests with her customary eloquence. There were a couple of weaker spots too unfortunately, Mark Hadfield’s Baker had serious tuning issues towards the end and Ben Stott as Jack made me feel continually nervous, never really seeming to settle. Ultimately though, this is a show that moves the head and not really the heart for me, no matter how well performed. It is so clever and so tricksy with its intermingling of these familiar stories and then riffing off on them in unexpected directions, but there’s just so much packed in that scenes are bitty and end up feeling rushed (especially in the second half) but crucially for me, there’s too little emotional engagement. A scene towards the end is heartbreakingly beautiful with a wonderful twist explaining the choice of a young narrator but it has no room to breathe as the jaunty refrain of ‘Into The Woods…’ strikes up yet again breaking the mood even as the tears begin to form in the eyes."
1497,1497,Ought To Be Clowns,29/09/2017,Ian,Turkey, Hope Theatre,"It’s a bold move to put a character as flawed as Madeline front and centre in your debut play; still more to not give her the kind of redemption arc that conventional wisdom suggests we crave in our drama. So Frankie Meredith’s Turkey reveals itself as a nifty piece of writing, developed from a true family story in a Soho Young Writers Lab exercise in 2015 and now premiering at the ever-welcoming Hope Theatre. At first it doesn’t seem that way. We meet Madeline in the afterglow of a passionate vodka-fuelled night with Toni, adamant she’s not a lesbian – she has a boyfriend she’s cheating on after all – but soon entwined in a full-blown relationship. Fast-forward to moving in together and squabbling over which organic vegetables to buy, the focus of the play soon emerges as Madeline’s unstoppable desire to have a baby becomes the dominant force in their lives.  In and of itself, it’s a fascinating story to tell from an LGBTQ+ perspective: who, if anyone, gets to have the biological link to the child and how to decide who the ‘third’ should be. Amid the pressures that this kind of immense decision-making puts on their relationship, Meredith also layers in an additional complication in the form of Michael, the father of Madeline’s dead ex-boyfriend who comes back on the scene after 12 years away. There’s hints of Yerma in the way that the drive to have a child can prove so destructive but this is a defiantly 21st century world where society’s rules are not so strict, it’s individuals’ behaviour that is the thing. And Peyvand Sadeghian’s Madeline embodies this self-absorption well, unable or unwilling to comprehend how her actions impact those closest to her but not malicious with it, just all-too-ineffably human both at her loving best and her manipulative worst. Director Niall Phillips has also cast well against her – Harriet Green’s compassionate Toni pushed increasingly to her limits, Cameron Robertson’s grief-stricken Michael dancing around on the moral high ground (where he’s ultimately just a little too comfortable). And if the design of four square boxes encourages an occasional staticness in some of the scenes, the squalling rock of the soundtrack infuses a keenly raw edge to Turkey’s energy.  With her declaration that we’re all fuck-ups and fundamentally dishonest to each other, and the simultaneous suggestion that this is just the way life is sometimes, Meredith announces herself as a writer with something to say. She has a great ear for a throwaway comic line and captures a zeitgeisty tone to her humour as she gently mocks the Wikipedia-stealing, wi-fi obsessed society we’ve become, and also tosses in an intelligently understated look at modern sexual attitudes and how no matter how progressive they are, they don’t excuse you from common decency when it comes to those you love.    "
1498,1498,Ought To Be Clowns,16/07/2014,mag9l,Intimate Apparel, Park Theatre,"The Theatre Royal Bath hit on another winner with this production of Lynn Nottage’s Intimate Apparel and so it has transferred over to the Park Theatre to let Londoners who don’t travel have a slice of the action. The play was inspired by Nottage finding faded photographs of her great-grandparents and then spinning an affectionate fantasia on the lives of African-American people at the turn of the twentieth century. She imagines the life of Esther, an unmarried black seamstress in her mid-thirties in 1905 New York, who is a true exponent of her craft. People come from far and wide for the exquisite lingerie that she creates and her clients include women of all classes and colour and so she has managed to save up quite the nest egg. Her plans for the future include running her own salon but when a romantic correspondence is struck up with the Barbadian George, she dares to dream of more. But just as internet dating is today rife with difficulties with people hiding behind fake or enhanced photographs, this play reminds us that romance via love letters is just as full of peril as it turns out that George’s florid turn of phrase masks a brusque personality that brings a harsh reality once he arrives in New York from the Panama Canal where he has been working. Tanya Moodie and Chu Omambala play this relationship out beautifully, a huge subtlety is at work in Laurence Boswell’s production."
1499,1499,Ought To Be Clowns,20/04/2019,Ian,Amélie the Musical, Watermill Theatre,"In a week marked by the heartbreaking sight of Notre Dame aflame, the decidedly Gallic charms of Amélie the Musical arrive to offer a soothing balm. The show – music by Daniel Messé, lyrics by Messé and Nathan Tysen and a book by Craig Lucas – didn’t fare so well on Broadway in 2017 but the creatives, along with director Michael Fentiman, have substantially reworked the material to great effect. The result is something which cleaves much closer to Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s original film Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amélie Poulain in every inch of its spirit. From singing goldfish to licking stage blood off fingers, Elton John cameos to intimidating figs, there’s a wonderful weirdness to the world created here. It’s no wonder that the introverted Amélie struggles at first to find her place in this hyper-real version of Paris. Madeleine Girling’s design plays up these fantastical elements with some ingenious choices whose reveals are a constant delight, especially in the intimacy of the Watermill. And Elliot Griggs’ lighting is crucial in setting this visual language with all its transportative magic. Even the puppetry works (despite my enduring antipathy to the form). A 12-strong actor-musician ensemble are on magnificent form throughout, whether executing Tom Jackson Greaves’ movement with eloquence or nailing Messé’s revitalised score. Arranged for piano, woodwind, accordion and achingly good strings by Barnaby Race, George Francis’ musical direction is inspired, infusing the joie de vivre that was sadly missing from the Broadway cast recording. And at the heart of the story, Audrey Brisson is perfect casting as Amélie. She has the kind of other-worldliness that at one glance is quirkily charming (of course she flies into her bedroom) but at another is cripplingly socially awkward. And as the second half winds into a captivating pseudo-love story with Chris Jared’s entirely genial Nino, Brisson sensitively captures the breath-catching wonder of finally taking steps towards self-actualisation. The final scenes are beautifully affecting, the production able to use silence just as powerfully as it does its soaring songs. And I absolutely adored it. For all its fantastical leanings, there’s something so true to heart about its messaging – the isolation of metropolitan living, how cruel a trap anxiety can be, the enormous power of small acts of kindness…follow those blue arrows and go see Amélie wherever you can."
1500,1500,Ought To Be Clowns,01/10/2019,Ian,‘Master Harold’…and the boys, National Theatre,"At a moment where a Tory Home Secretary chillingly grins while declaring an end to ‘freedom of movement’, the idea of reckoning with one’s legacy carries an extra pungency. That any of us might be able to do with even just a hint of Athol Fugard’s self-reflective elegance as in his 1982 play ‘Master Harold’…and the boys, is something to think about whether your last name is Patel, Pietersen or Parker. Master Harold... is set in 1950, in apartheid-era South Africa, and is situated somewhere in the realm of semi-autobiography. Running in real-time on a rainy afternoon in Port Elizabeth, gangly teenager Hally is hiding out from his parents and hanging with their familiy’s two servants Sam and Willie.  They’ve got their mind on the upcoming ballroom dancing championship but as their young master goes through the emotional wringer, the limits of their friendship become all too brutally apparent.  What sings through Roy Alexander Weise’s perfectly calibrated production here (returning to the NT after the glorious Nine Night) is the innate understanding of how profoundly Fugard’s writing reaches. It is a powerful indictment of the regime under which he lived, sure, but its lessons stretch far beyond the veldt. How racism can lodge itself in the most unassuming of minds because of environment, sure but more crucially, how it festers due to individual shortcomings. Here, it is a self-loathing rooted in familial dysfunction, and one which has blinded Hally to the realities of who Sam and Willie are to him. As reminiscences of the past tumble out, there’s a shocking lack of appreciation for the difficulties of acting in loco parentis when you can’t even share a bench (that kite story…my heart!). And as he pushes, too far, something massive fractures around them, even if ultimately nothing might actually substantively change.  "
1501,1501,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2015,mag9l,Scarlet, Southwark Playhouse,"We could all be Scarlet. A confident university student who knows what’s what and what she wants, her life is turned upside down after the consequences of a night’s heavy drinking are splashed across the internet without her consent. This video was posted by a nerdish man she previously turned down and its sexually explicit content has huge ramifications for Scarlet, not least in the course of action it leads her to take, as told in the world premiere by Theatre Renegade, currently playing in The Little at the Southwark Playhouse. The world of sexual politics has a new frontier to deal with in the age of social media and this is what Sam H Freeman’s first play deals with in an engaging and essential way. The company of four actors all take on the role of Scarlet at one point or another, sharing her story and her experiences, but also questioning and interacting with each other. Splitting the narrative this way also throws up questions of how we are with the world around us, as each performer also plays the supporting characters in this story – or at least Scarlet’s versions of them.  Joe Hufton’s production deals extremely well with this theatrical conceit and the whip-sharp dialogue is handled with aplomb by all four, especially once the tone darkens as Scarlet struggles to deal with the situation. Her relationships with her boyfriend and friends suffer, her revenge tactics backfire due to society’s hypocrisy when it comes to boasting about men’s sexual prowess whilst slut-shaming women in the same breath, her inability to see herself as a victim – whilst nominally a show of strength – blinds her to the reality of the abuse she can’t, or won’t, acknowledge has happened."
1502,1502,Ought To Be Clowns,22/01/2012,Ian,King John, Union,"Given the ubiquity of productions of Shakespeare’s works in so many of our theatres, and in particular of certain works within the canon, one might assume that those that remain neglected remain so for a very good reason. But director Phil Willmott and the Union Theatre clearly do not agree and after the successful run last year of Double Falsehood, its disputed authorship notwithstanding, they have now turned to a play that was definitely by Shakespeare, but remains very rarely produced in the modern day – King John. They say things come in threes and after having seen Prince John in The Lion in Winter and in the RSC’s The Heart of Robin Hood, it seems apt to seen him all grown up in this play, even if it might as well have been three different people for all the continuity of character! The play is focused on questions of legitimacy as John acceded to the throne at the expense of his nephew Arthur to control the Angevin Empire whose borders stretched far into France due to the land originally held by his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine. But he is not a natural-born leader like his father Henry II or brother Richard the Lionheart and his already tenuous hold on his kingdom is further threatened when the King of France throws his support behind young Arthur and demands his abdication. Thus John is driven to increasingly desperate action as battles rage, noblemen’s loyalties waver and to cap it all off, the Pope is displeased and is considering excommunicating him. Phil Willmott’s uncluttered production makes remarkably clear sense of a plot which is often dangerously close to convoluted and makes a virtue of its simplicity. A chair and four tables are the only set yet they are endlessly reconfigured to create a grand throne, the ramparts of a castle or a banqueting table stretching the width of the stage; costumes are modern(ish) but non-specific, releasing the play from tightly defined context. This in turn allows the actors to fully focus on fleshing out their characters and drawing out the timeless parallels: the usual Shakespearean array of betrayals, revenge, murder, love and avarice are present but are given a fresh spin by the (relative) unfamiliarity of the story. The play is at its best when focusing on John as a monarch. There’s no particularly defining characteristic about him, like say Richard III’s hunchback, aside from a ruthless hunger for power but it is this relentless, amoral pursuit that actually strikes home in Nicholas Osmond’s portrayal. Affably normal and likeable at first, there’s little of the regal statesman about him as he tries to charm his way through but as power corrupts him, his demeanour stiffens, the moodswings become darker and his wretchedness exposed in his desperate clinging to power, yet there’s still a twinkle in the eye – note the hilarious reaction to his mother’s death. He bonds well with Philip the Bastard, his closest man in court and the broadest, most entertainingly fully-rounded character in the show. He’s brought to vivid life by Rikki Lawton, a performance which is close to over-emphatic at times in the small space of the Union but whose energy provides a fillip throughout. The issue that I found with the play though, and the reason I suspect it has collected so much dust, is its frequent excessive verbiosity, a recurring factor in the lesser History plays. Sometimes in certain scenes, it catches fire as in the magnificent face-off between Eleanor and Constance, mother of Arthur, Maggie Daniels and Samantha Lawson both crackling with fury, and assassin Hubert’s melting at Arthur’s innocence is given heartbreaking form by John Last; at others the actors struggle to impose vivid characterisations on the underdeveloped supporting roles, a lack of depth to so many of them meaning their impact is curtailed despite the good work from the cast. This is a particular shame as there’s so much exploration of ambiguity, both moral and political, hinted at which thus never comes to fruition."
1503,1503,Ought To Be Clowns,12/03/2012,Ian,A Place at the Table, Tristan Bates,"Simon Block’s A Place at the Table first played London at the Bush Theatre in 2000, but is only receiving its first revival in the capital now with this production by Signal Theatre Company at the Tristan Bates Theatre near Cambridge Circus. Adam is a playwright who is highly excited when a meeting is set up with a television executive to discuss options for his latest play. But what editor Sarah has in mind is a boundary-pushing, and possibly taste-defying, leap which will put the disability of its lead character at the centre of the situation comedy she is proposing. Adam’s own disability factors into his decision-making in unexpected ways as the general insanity of the television industry swirls around him, threatening to swallow him whole. There’s a great deal of sharp wit contained in here. Block has a riotous way of skewering the pretension of so much of the media-speak that trips off the tongues of the fiercely ambitious TV types as they circle Adam – best exemplified by the amusing redefinition of ‘broad’casting and the gag about the mooted title for a gay charity shop sitcom ‘Charity begins at homo’. But he does tend to rely a bit too much on this as a default mode for the play: a considerable proportion of the dialogue exists at this level which is ultimately quite distracting in its verbosity – yet managing to say precious little – and furthermore in its repetition, it also loses some of its impact as the show progresses. Likewise, the more serious vein of the writing, of the conflict between creating something with artistic integrity and making television that sells, of pressures felt by television producers to try and second-guess the next big success as network bigwigs breathe down their necks, suggests an interesting premise which the playwright never really fully brings to fruition. Instead the focus is shared (a little too much) with the hypocrisy of the industry and the fluidity of employment within it – areas where little new insight is really provided. What did work for me though was the way in which the issue of disability was variously touched on: whether through the inarticulacy of so many in simply talking to a disabled person, the positioning of accessible toilets, the preconceptions and perceptions carried heavily by those who are somehow different. Particularly pertinent was the issue of labelling – Adam brings along cuttings of his reviews, all of which cite his disability when what he longs for is to be seen as just a writer rather than a ‘wheelchair-bound writer’. Balancing this desire with the potential of exploiting one’s handicap is an issue that many disabled people face – when applying for some jobs, one can tick a form and be guaranteed an interview but the price paid is the knowledge of never knowing if one quite got their on one’s own merits. I liked the ambiguity with which Block plays with here, Adam flip-flops on the issue which may seem contrary, but to me it felt true to life – it’s a dilemma which has no easy answer and no firm one either. Christopher Tester does well to give this complexity a strong believability as Adam, a man dealing with his own prejudices as much as those of those around him. And Kellie Batchelor is very strong as Sarah, the TV exec who is carrying out her own balancing act of integrity and ambition and frequently keeping us guessing as to which will be the winner."
1504,1504,Ought To Be Clowns,05/02/2020,Ian,Sara Bareilles and Gavin Creel in Waitress, Adelphi Theatre,"I wasn’t going to go back to Waitress, having enjoyed both my previous visits to the Adelphi Theatre where I was blown away by Katharine McPhee and then Lucie Jones in the leading role of Jenna. But then a genius casting move (surely this doesn’t count as stunt casting? who knows…🤷) saw the show’s composer and lyricist Sara Bareilles and Olivier and Tony Award winner Gavin Creel announced for a limited run and so I couldn’t help but book myself in for another slice of pie. Both of them appeared in the show on Broadway so they’re clearly au fait with their roles but more significantly, they clearly share a special connection and so their electricity as Jenna and Dr Pomatter is off the charts. The shenanigans in the doctor’s surgery are always fun but here, they’re fricking hilarious as Creel and Bareilles bounce off each other while having the time of their lives and almost, almost, making you forget the slight ickiness of the boundaries that their incipient relationship crosses.  Also new to the cast is Evelyn Hoskins’ Dawn who, along with Joel Montague’s Ogie, is doing a great job of stretching the interpretation of her character. Hoskins brings a slightly more manic, even unhinged, aspect to Dawn that pairs well with Montague’s more nuanced take on Ogie, both suggesting a bolder approach to neurodiversity without sacrificing any of the laughs.   "
1505,1505,Ought To Be Clowns,03/09/2017,Ian,9 to 5, Upstairs at the Gatehouse,"As frothy as 9 to 5 the Musical may seem, it shouldn’t be underestimated as a piece of theatre that puts three women front and centre in its narrative – it can feel like these sadly remain as few and far between in the 1980 of the original film as it does in the 2017 of the UK fringe premiere of its musical adaptation. And reflecting that, director Joseph Hodges and casting director Harry Blumenau have really done the business in selecting a terrific trio to lead their show. Pippa Winslow’s Violet leads from the front with a wonderfully wry wit and poised determination, Amanda Coutts’ Judy blossoms in self-confidence throughout to nail her 11 o’clock number, and Louise Olley’s Doralee is an utterly radiant stage presence, delivering the kind of direct eye contact that could leave a boy questioning his sexual preferences. And together, these three secretaries at Consolidated Industries tackle workplace misogyny in their own inimitable way. Patricia Resnick’s book, from her own screenplay co-written with Colin Higgins, is a trifling fancy but it does contain nuggets of office-based truth – the way in which malicious gossip is all too easily believed, how appearances shape our opinions no matter what we say, how photocopiers are the work of the devil if you’re up against a deadline. And as a revenge fantasy accidentally turned real, it is engagingly fun, particularly where Leo Sené’s lecherous boss Franklin Hart, Jr. is concerned (boy’s got some serious comic skills in the making there).  Dolly Parton’s score mixes original tracks with choice selections from her back catalogue and ultimately it is a solid rather than a stand-out collection. Oliver Hance’s band certainly give it their best shot though and in a recurring theme, finds its greatest successes when the leads are together. The gentle hopefulness of ‘I Just Might’, the effervescence of Act 1 closer ‘Shine Like The Sun’, the rousing sentiment of ‘Change It’ – Winslow, Coutts and Olley are magic together.  It’s a shame then that Hodges doesn’t allow his production to rest on these strengths. Chris Whittaker’s choreography is both over-insistent (it doesn’t always feel needed, as in making a comedy routine out of sexual harassment) and over enthusiastic (it frequently tries too hard, the frenetic demands of the opening number proving too hard to keep in sync). Where it works, as in the showbiz routine for ‘One of the Boys’, the dance is dreamy but too often, less would very much be more. And the design can feel a little ramshackle at times, the intimacy of the Gatehouse is unforgiving to the smaller details and the work here isn’t always as up to the mark as it could be. But it is the performances that are the key – Samantha Giffard’s Roz is another highlight – and here, 9 to 5 delivers, what a way to make a livin’ eh?!"
1506,1506,Ought To Be Clowns,26/10/2014,Ian,Spine, Soho Theatre,"Among many things, this blog is useful for reminding me of exactly how I felt about this production or that actor but in some cases, I don’t need to be reminded. Seeing Rosie Wyatt in a solo piece for the first time (in Jack Thorne’s Bunny back in 2011) was a genuine revelation, at the time I was always unsure about monologues and hardly went to any and it is no overstatement to say she changed my mind about a whole genre – that’ll be why she was ranked as one of the top six female performances of the year for me. So it was no surprise to see me at the Soho Theatre Upstairs (again) on a dark October evening (again) to see Wyatt (again) in a solo show (again). Creatures of habit… us? This time round it is Clara Brennan’s Spine to which she is giving her unbridled dramatic energy, inhabiting the play and the space so thoroughly that she ought to charge other people rent for coming in to use it when she’s not there. It’s quite a remarkable thing to watch, seeing her perform, as she flicks so effortlessly between the two characters of the show – ferocious but fragile Amy and perceptive pensioner Glenda – and traces the growing if unlikely friendship between the pair as circumstance thrusts them together. She demands the full attention too, some may baulk from the direct eye contact but it is such an integral part of the theatrical transaction here that it ought to be compulsory to embrace it. Be warned though, Wyatt takes literally no prisoners!"
1507,1507,Ought To Be Clowns,06/02/2019,Ian,Noughts & Crosses, Derby Theatre,"At a moment when co-operation between theatres has never been more vital, and yet when national tours feel fraught with danger as cancellations loom large, it is pleasing to see Pilot Theatre and Derby Theatre putting their money where their mouth is with this production of Noughts & Crosses, co-produced with Belgrade Theatre Coventry, Mercury Theatre Colchester and York Theatre Royal. With that in mind, it’s undoubtedly a canny choice of material, Malorie Blackman’s hugely popular young adult novel adapted here by Sabrina Mahfouz. Set in a alternative near future in which race relations are tipped right upside down, where systemic power lies in the hands of the black population and it is white people who suffer unconscionable oppression and abuse, Blackman then inserts a Romeo and Juliet love story but one which speaks much more to our times.   Esther Richardson’s production has a highly striking aesthetic. Simon Kenny’s design, alongside Arun Ghosh and Xana’s sound and Joshua Drualus Pharo’s lighting conjure up something close to dystopia in its boldness, powerfully demarcating the world of the haves and the havenots. And it is a world that is chillingly convincing, cutting so close to the bones of our own reality."
1508,1508,Ought To Be Clowns,25/08/2019,Ian,The View UpStairs, Soho Theatre,"There’s something so powerful about the power of theatre to educate as well as ilustrate. The 1973 arson attack that took the lives of 32 people in a New Orleans gay bar was actually the most tragic hate crime until Orlando but it remains comparatively little known. So Max Vernon’s choice to use it as inspiration for his musical The View UpStairs is freighted with significance from the off. And at its best, it is hugely powerful. A cross between a kind of oral history and musical theatre, it fleshes out the lives of gay people in 1970s USA in all its multi-faceted nature through its collection of what might at first be mistaken as stock characters. The aspiring drag queen, the sharp-edged hustler, the dreamy twink, the closeted musician, the lesbian ‘mother’, all are present and correct. What Vernon does so skilfully, is to knit them altogether to evoke the real sense of community, of chosen family within this group. Through an eclectic score that draws influence from the period, it is gorgeously drawn, beautifully compelling. Declan Bennett’s haunted Dale, Andy Mientus’ sweetly open Patrick, Cedric Neal’s charismatic Willy, Carly Mercedes Dyer’s magnificent barowner Henri, these are people you want to spend time with. Less successful, for me at least, is the framing of the story. Present-day fashion designer Wes is in need of new premises and upon finding this rundown building, is swept up through the magic of rainbow-hued time travel to the night of the attack. And so layered into the story is a culture clash between the generations, which results in a rather unsubtle hammering of the point about the glibness of contemporary young gays."
1509,1509,Ought To Be Clowns,24/02/2011,Ian,Racing Demon, Crucible,"Daniel Evans has assembled a truly top-notch cast here, fully fleshing out the expertly characterised clergymen whether it was Jamie Parker’s evangelical but passionate young curate who stirs things up from the moment of his arrival, Matthew Cottle’s kindly Streaky who plods on with an appealing honesty or Ian Gelder’s superb Harry, being hounded out of the closet by a rapacious tabloid journalist. But even the bishops, perceived as the ‘enemy’ here, played by Jonathan Coy and Mark Tandy are powerfully persuasive as we come to understand the larger pressures they feel in a Church under threat from all angles. But it is Malcolm Sinclair’s central Lionel whose dilemma dominates proceedings and he is never less than utterly convincing as a man who is determined to do great good even whilst his faith wavers. Certain aspects, like the gay priest being hounded by the media sub-plot felt rather dated (and the sexual chemistry strangely muted, it really was like watching something from the 90s!), but largely many of the issues it dealt with, of an organisation in crisis about its very existence, were universal enough to keep the play markedly relevant. However for me, it relied a little too much on individual speechifying rather than creating a truly believable, well-integrated slice of life onstage. The prayer-based soliloquies were effective at revealing some of the inner motivations of the characters, but often the carefully constructed arguments which marked many of the scenes, no matter how thoughtfully delivered, came across as too intelligently considered rather than as real words that could have been spoken by real people: Emma Hamilton’s Frances is the most guilty here, her character being used to fulfil too many counterbalancing roles and she did well to inject some passion into a difficult part. I left Racing Demon thinking that it had been very well performed and agreed with my erstwhile companion that it was very well written, but I have to say it never really moved me in the way that I wanted or provided the thrill of entertainment, it was a little too cerebral for that and as a subject matter, the state of theology in an increasingly secular world is not one to which I would normally gravitate. The sense of distance was nurtured by Tom Rogers’ spare staging: Tim Mitchell’s lighting design made great use of this in creating ecclesiastical spaces both public and private, but the lack of intimacy also sometimes worked against creating emotional involvement. Still, I’m glad that I made the trip to Sheffield to see this, a play that made it into the National Theatre’s top 100 plays of the century no less, and an opportunity to start to make my own mind up about Hare’s writing."
1510,1510,Ought To Be Clowns,25/11/2009,Ian,La Cage aux Folles, Playhouse,"When it was first announced that John Barrowman would be taking one of the lead roles in La Cage au Folles, many, including myself, instantly called this a crazy decision. Having seen this show twice already with different casts, and it remaining one of my favourite things I have seen on the stage this year, I had my doubts about this particular casting decision but when a family delegation (including 3 major Barrowman fangirls) expressed their interest in coming down to see the show, tickets were booked. The obvious criticism is that John Barrowman is too young and good-looking to play Albin, especially given the actors who have played the role here previously, but by casting an equally younger-looking and handsome Simon Burke as his lover, this production has been cleverly reconceived. Instead of being a meditation on a drag queen at the end of his career, the focus here is more on Albin’s insecurities about his relationship with Georges, the comment about not being able to play Salome any longer becomes more of a bitchy aside than a sad statement of truth. There has been a considerable injection of raunchiness into this production, with some very suggestive croissant eating that was dangerously close to the bone (fnarr fnarr) for a family show. However this more overt sexuality played very convincingly with the younger coupling and led to some hilarious scenes. Barrowman was actually much better than I thought he would be, fitting easily and comfortably into Zaza’s heels and working the audience like a dream. The only downside for me was his rendition of ‘I am what I am’: beautifully and emotionally sung in the first verse, the man described as an “Entertainer with a capital E” in the programme then slipped into Singing a Showtune with a capital S and lost much of the emotional impact that the song should have, reclaiming it only with the final dramatic flounce out of the theatre past his distraught lover. For me, Simon Burke was the real revelation here though. Only ever having seen him as a serious actor in straight roles, his Georges was probably the best one I have seen yet. His singing was superb, his MCing was genuinely funny and he works really hard at creating the meaningful relationships with his lover and son that form the heart of the show. His chemistry with Barrowman is a delight to see, they obviously revel in each other’s company and their final scenes together were beautifully touching. Tracie Bennett remains great fun as the bawdy Jacqueline, and the Cagelles still wow with their eye-popping routines."
1511,1511,Ought To Be Clowns,10/08/2011,Ian,Crazy for You, Open Air Theatre,"There’s no hiding the fact that the Open Air Theatre’s Crazy for You is pure hokum but for sheer escapist fun and a feel-good atmosphere that will whisk you away from the troubles outside of Regent’s Park for an evening, this will pretty much do the trick. Based on the George and Ira Gershwin musical Girl Crazy, Ken Ludwig – he of the recently departed Lend Me A Tenor – wrote a new book in 1992, heavy on post-modern knowingness and light on substance: silly but fun – if you come here looking for authenticity you’re bound to be disappointed! Banker Bobby Child is forced to abandon his Broadway dreams and is dispatched to Deadrock, Nevada to foreclose on a theatre there. Sensing an opportunity as he falls head over heels with the daughter of the theatre’s owner, he decides to impersonate the Broadway impresario he longs to work for and arranges for a benefit show to be put on to save the theatre: madcap fun ensues with mistaken identities – clearly a Ludwig fave – at the fore. But what makes this show is the singing and dancing. The musical has been co-opted into a Gershwin compilation show and so classic follows classic as the catalogue is cherry-picked and strongly invigorated by Gareth Valentine’s arrangements and musical direction. Adding Stephen Mears’ vibrant choreography really does lift things into the stratosphere with routine after routine filled with breathtaking delight: the thrill of the opening of Bidin’ My Time the playfulness of the prop-filled I Got Rhythm, there are so many highlights but they do all come with the music."
1512,1512,Ought To Be Clowns,24/03/2011,Ian,Cause Célèbre, Old Vic,"Cause Célèbre is perhaps one of the most eagerly awaited events of the Terence Rattigan centenary celebrations, being directed by Thea Sharrock who helmed the multi-Olivier-winning After the Dance at the National Theatre last year. She brings this play, the last to be written by Rattigan in 1976 before his death the next year, to the Old Vic featuring the return to the stage of Anne-Marie Duff, alongside Niamh Cusack and a large supporting cast. This was a preview performance and I attended as part of the What’s on Stage group outing. The play is based on the 1930s real-life story of Alma Rattenbury, a woman nearly 40 accused and put on trial for murdering her elderly husband along with her 18-year old lover. Society was scandalised and enthralled by the trial, not necessarily because of the crime but because of the moral profligacy that was perceived in Alma taking such a young lover, and one who was her servant to boot, and it is the attitudes of society that Rattigan focuses on. He introduces the fictionalised character of Edith Davenport into the narrative, a woman of very traditional values who is the forewoman of the jury hearing Alma’s case, yet who is struggling with her own issues as she is divorcing her feckless husband and dealing her son who has inherited his father’s taste for debauchery (as she sees it), a crucial point being that he is the same age as Alma’s lover, something which clouds her judgement from the start. My over-riding emotion about Cause Célèbre, unlike that of my companions it must be said, was one of ambivalence. It is all very well put together but there was something missing for me which meant I never really got involved with proceedings. Partly this was to do with the structure of the play which flits between past and present, stunting the emotional development of the work. The courtroom scenes, with its flashbacks to the events of the fateful night, are smoothly done but are hardly anything new and the focus on the lawyers and their backroom chat feels a strange choice as we barely know these characters. Given the focus of the story seems to be the juxtaposition of the two women at its heart, it just seems the play would benefit from a stronger examination of their domestic situations and a deeper examination of why they are the women they are. Not enough time is spent on the relationships in their lives, indeed we hardly get a real sense of Alma’s husband at all, and so it ends up being a rather run-of-the-mill courtroom standard, only elevating above that with the devastating finale. Niamh Cusack is outstanding as the tightly-buttoned Edith, unable to deviate from her strict moral code no matter the cost and it is her dilemmas that form the beating heart of the show. Anne-Marie Duff’s Alma is an altogether more flighty and enigmatic individual of whom one is never too sure, a victim of society’s prejudice to be sure but beyond that it is hard to tell as her relationships with Timothy Carlton’s staid husband and Tommy McDonnell’s lover are rather underdeveloped, though they all do well with what they have. Elsewhere I really enjoyed Lucy Robinson’s haughty society mistress Stella (her Lady Macbeth opposite Gary Webster in a mobster-inspired production at the Bolton Octagon was one of those moments that made me fall in love with theatre as a teenager), Jenny Galloway’s under-used companion and Nicholas Jones’ maverick barrister. Indeed, there were no real weak links in terms of the acting, just limited opportunities for characters to flourish and therefore never really giving the sense of an ensemble of strong characters around the leads that I’ve come to associate with Rattigan’s work. Hildegard Bechtler’s rather minimalist design makes the most of opening up the huge stage of the Old Vic to great effect, but it is Bruno Poet’s lighting that is the real star of the show, working absolute wonders in creating the distinct locations of the plays but more importantly, allows for the highly effective cross-fading of scenes which surmounts its radio roots with a minimum of fuss. The gorgeous simplicity of much of the imagery thus created is just beautiful to look at. There’s also a rather innovative use of the space, calling to mind The White Guard for some reason, which I won’t give away here but I’d recommend avoiding sitting in the front few rows… I’m still relatively new to Rattigan’s work but I couldn’t help but be a little disappointed in Cause Célèbre. Even without comparing it to After the Dance and Flare Path, there’s a lack of dramatic impetus here and not enough of Rattigan’s customary incisive character studies. Reading the programme notes about the difficult genesis of this play with Rattigan suffering badly from terminal cancer and ricocheting between collaborators, it is tempting to point to this as a reason why, despite the best efforts of Sharrock and the cast and creatives, this is not really representative of Rattigan at his best. You say you would avoid the front few rows… will I miss major things in doing so (because of stage hieght etc), or is it so I have a better overall view (or tableau is you like) of the stage? This is a laboured, painfully slow night in the theatre.  The characters, though played with brio, are without exception barely two-dimensional. Anna Marie-Duff is clearly intent on giving a 'great' performance but the repetitive material constantly undermines her, and she simply overacts.  The legal and courtroom scenes are extremely dull and the cross-cutting between expository bluff and undramatic backstory is unconvincing and tedious. It put me in mind of an especially tedious episode of Midsomer Murders but without the laughs. Overall the sheer lack of involving drama, the miserable sets and the weirdly dim and uneven lighting don't support the (rather forced) performances which the actor's give. The miscasting of an underdeveloped adult as Rattenbury's six year old 'son' is unintentionally comical. Rather a misconceived mess I'm afraid. I couldn't wait for it to end. It's nothing major (and I didn't want to give it away in the main review): there's a box that drops in from on high and hangs above the stage, where only a few scenes are played but I imagine you'd have to crane your neck to see up there from the first couple of rows. Interesting view Mr Tynan, I didn't dislike it quite that much but agree that it was strangely uninvolving and that Duff struggles with the material. Will be interesting to see what the critics make of it. The front row is great value for under 26s at £12 but I'd have been very annoyed to pay full price for that (or I suspect the rows immediately behind it) since you do struggle to see what's going on in the upper levels. I could see chest upwards most of the time, but they disappeared from view entirely when on the bed. Mr Tynan: wasn't Oliver Coopersmith playing the 13-year-old son rather than the 6-year-old? Assuming that's who you mean. And he's about 17, so I think your ""underdeveloped adult"" comment is a little cruel ! Ian – Yes, I thought less of it than you but you've striven to be positive, clearly. I simply found it dramatically inert with any psychological motivation for the crime completely unexplored. We're simply given a linear view of a crime and then beaten insensible with a half-baked staging of a courtroom drama which repeats the scenes we've already spent over an hour watching! The staging is almost amateur at times; especially when a significant portion of the British judiciary enter stage left into what had been seconds earlier a home counties living room. The required cross-fade was utterly inept… The battered corpse of the husband looked like something dodgy from a kiddies Guy Fawkes' night. 3rdspear – If you're right then having a 17 yr old play a 13 yr old is no wiser… The individual concerned simply looked like a Wizard of Oz munchkin in long socks and a school cap. And various others I spoke to afterwards agreed. I actually have a passionate love of the theatre. Which is why I won't tolerate this third rate tripe, staged for tourists, presumably… Well, it is *slightly* wiser than having a 17-year-old playing a 6-year-old… I don't think anyone's questioning your passionate love of theatre, but please don't go assuming that those of us who did enjoy it is a tourist with no taste. 🙂 As for the staging, Rattigan clearly states in the stage directions that there should be no effort made to represent the settings realistically, and I can't say I had any problem figuring out where each bit was meant to be. Well, it is *slightly* wiser than having a 17-year-old playing a 6-year-old… I don't think anyone's questioning your passionate love of theatre, but please don't go assuming that those of us who did enjoy it are tourists with no taste. 🙂"
1513,1513,Ought To Be Clowns,13/07/2014,mag9l,Then, Soho Theatre,"Proving that there are indeed no unfunny stories about Shania Twain, Yve Blake & Co’s Then has been delighting audiences all week long in the oven that is the Soho Theatre upstairs so I was pleased to be able to sneak into the final show of the run. Blake set up a website called whowerewe.com, invited the world to respond to the above question and then fashioned a show out of their answers, something that sits somewhere between performance art, stand-up, musical theatre and straight-up play. The collage that she has created is entertaining, endearing, even enlightening. Bouncing off the collaborative energy from video designers Rosa Nussbaum and Joel Enfield, musical director Alex Groves and designer Naomi Kuyck-Cohen, Blake bounds onto the stage with an effervescence that never flags as she sings, dances and goofs her way through the memories that people have elected to share – the childhood dreams, the embarrassing photos, the bewildering confessions of youthful naïveté right through to more moving anecdotes of later life.  Then is undoubtedly better when it focuses on the light-hearted – the careful posing for childhood photos in case of later celebrity, the fraternal bond that transcended even a bitten penis, the trials of teenage courting, the sheer variety of the crowd-sourced material managing the dual feat of sheepish recognition but also the very uniqueness of everyone’s life experience. Profundity comes naturally through the sterling work here from Blake and dramaturg Georgia Symons which thus means when the piece deliberately strains for it later on, it’s not quite as effective. "
1514,1514,Ought To Be Clowns,07/07/2010,Ian,Nevermore, Barbican,"Nevermore: The Imaginary Life and Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe is a show by Canadian company Catalyst Theatre and is playing a short residency in the Barbican’s main theatre as part of their bite festival and the London International Festival of Theatre. Using a mixture of physical theatre and songs, it follows Poe’s life from his troubled childhood to the unexplained circumstances around his death, mixed into the narrative are hallucinatory dream sequences as we see the events of his life as if told in the manner of one of own stories. There’s a whole raft of comparisons that one could make to try and describe the world created by Catalyst on the stage here; the Jan Pieńkowski books of my childhood, Tim Burton, the Lemony Snicket film, Dr Seuss, these should give you an inkling of the type of thing we’re talking about here as otherwise I’m not sure I could do it justice. Bretta Gerecke’s design draws on all of these, using a wall of gauzy black lace screens to move between reality and the imagination, and creates a world full of exaggerated, grotesque images and characters, enhanced by some very effective lighting and shadow-play. Although it is Poe’s name in the title, this really is a huge ensemble effort, the seven actors work tirelessly throughout at fully realising the world which this man inhabited. The story is told through the use of a rotating cast of narrators, talking and singing predominantly in rhyming verse: each actor (save Scott Shpeley as Poe) takes a turn at playing narrator as well as creating a considerable range of supporting characters. Beth Graham and Ryan Parker were a tiny tiny bit more notable but all impressed with both their acting and vocal talents and the nice use of choreography in so many of even the smallest gestures. The ensemble needs this strength as Poe is presented as quite a passive figure here, lost in his own imagination and reacting mostly silently to what happens to those around him but Shpeley copes admirably with this with a brilliant physical performance, taking us with him through his emotions almost by movement and facial expressions alone. Throughout there’s a nice blend of the gothic horror with a tongue-in-cheek humour that keeps things from ever getting too heavy, and there is a lot of darkness contained here as Poe’s life really was inordinately full of tragedy. The original score by Jonathan Christenson is darkly gothic and rather pervasive, it underscores all the action and though not performed live, adds hugely to the atmospheric production. The songs were mostly solid rather than outstanding melodically, although one group number close to the end was a feast of harmonies and had me humming it as I left the theatre."
1515,1515,Ought To Be Clowns,02/02/2019,Ian,Yours Sincerely, VAULT Festival,"Any show that references Céline Dion’s epic key change in ‘All By Myself’ is onto a winner, nevermind featuring a lip-sync there of. So I was always going to be well-inclined towards Will Jackson’s Yours Sincerely. But there’s something more here too, a generosity of spirit that makes it a show I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.   When Will finds that he has accidentally nicked 300 2nd class stamps from the Post Office, his instinctive response is to revive the lost art of letter-writing. So he pens missives to old flatmates, ex-boyfriends, childhood crushes, family members, customer service departments…no one is safe. And he reads us those letters, and their responses, a picture of a young man at a crucial point in his life emerges. Yours Sincerely is at its best when it is at its lightest. Pretending to be a 9-year-old boy called Sam to get chocolate buttons off Cadburys, reconnecting with the fit violinist from band and finding inventive uses for Luigi costumes, battling NHS regulations, there’s so much fun in watching Will on the make, and the insights we thus get into his character as a recent graduate who is struggling to find his path."

1517,1517,Ought To Be Clowns,16/11/2015,mag9l,The Moderate Soprano, Hampstead,"Urgh. The presence of national treasures Nancy Carroll and Roger Allam meant that there was never any doubt about booking a ticket for The Moderate Soprano at the Hampstead Theatre. But sequestered in the salubrious surroundings of Swiss Cottage, David Hare’s tale of the life of John Christie – the founder of the Glyndebourne opera festival – has the feel of ultimate #firstworldproblems with zero theatrical imperative behind it, unless of course you’re the ones dropping £200 plus for tickets there. The very fact that Glyndebourne were involved in the commissioning of the play tells you what level we’re operating on, a self-congratulatory tome of rose-tinted biography and operatic in-jokes but even that makes it sound more interesting than it actually is. Jeremy Herrin’s production is extraordinarily, fatally, lacking in anything resembling drama for a large proportion of its running time, its staid storytelling quickening no pulses, its static staging troubling no snoozers. Allam’s innate skill means he’s rarely less than watchable as a man struggling to bring his passion project to fruition but Carroll is severely under-used, even as the only woman in the cast, as his wife, their late-blooming (for him) love an interesting mis-match of a marriage. But the arguments for opera as the highest art form are purely designed to preach to the converted, the discussion about high prices strangely proud of its challenges to accessibility. "
1518,1518,Ought To Be Clowns,23/11/2015,mag9l,The Homecoming, Trafalgar Studios,"It’s good to know that theatre directors are only human too – anyone in their right mind who watched Channel 4 drama Humans over the summer would have noted Gemma Chan delivering one of the performances of the year in any medium and naturally wanted her in on their projects. She has been working for a while in film, TV and theatre but now she’s now appearing in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Jamie Lloyd has secured her services on stage in his new production of The Homecoming. Truth be told though, I needed someone that exciting to tempt me to see it as I don’t much get on with Pinter, I’ve never had that breakthrough moment with any of his works to make me what received wisdom assures me is there. And whilst I wouldn’t go quite so far to say I’m a complete convert, I can honestly say I haven’t ever enjoyed a Pinter production as much as this one. It’s the 50th anniversary of The Homecoming but though firmly anchored in its 1960s milieu, Lloyd imbues the play with a strongly contemporary dramatic feel that is hard to resist. From the forced perspective of Soutra Gilmour’s metal-framed floating set to the blood-red colour washes of Richard Howell’s striking lighting design, there’s a powerful, modern visual aesthetic, a bare minimum of furnishings to evoke the working class North London living room but still leaving an unmistakable sense of what it is trying to achieve. And though Pinter is famed for his pauses, Lloyd finds his own, speedier, rhythm in the writing (something I suspect may ruffle the feathers of more senior critics), punctuating scenes with private character moments. And what characters. Ron Cook pours viciously crotchety patriarch Max full to the brim with toxic vitriol, lean like a mongoose he oozes menace from his special armchair and is perfectly matched with a never-better and crisply spoken John Simm as middle son Lenny, coiling himself meticulously around the situation like a cobra eyeing its rival. Into this melting pot of antipathy arrives eldest son Lenny (Gary Kemp needing to ramp up the intensity for my liking) after six years away in the US with his wife Ruth in tow, a marvellously self-possessed Chan, shifting the already twisted sexual dynamic in the household. The casting of Chan toys with the notions of otherness that Michael Attenborough similarly hinted at when he directed Jenny Jules in the role at the Almeida, reinforcing the men’s misogyny with overtones of racial prejudice and preconceptions. But as with Jules, Chan heightens the enigmatic pull of Ruth, flirting beautifully and dangerously with Simm’s astounded Lenny and then insinuating herself into the heart of the household with a coldly contractual eye and an absolute sense of pragmatism. For me, it just works in a way I scarcely comprehend but certainly appreciate."
1519,1519,Ought To Be Clowns,18/07/2011,Ian,Loyalty, Hampstead Theatre,"Loyalty is the debut play from Sarah Helm, a journalist and author who also happens to be the wife of Jonathan Powell, who was Tony Blair’s chief of staff. This privileged position made her an intimate witness to the weeks leading up to the 2003 invasion which she opposed and it is that that she has developed into this work – described as ‘a fictionalised memoir’ – of the struggle of a chief of staff Nick to balance the personal and political as he advises a Prime Minister named Tony who is edging closer to invading Iraq with an American President named George whilst ignoring his own conscience and the stridently vocal objections of his wife Laura. But it is fiction remember, at least some of the names are different… The first half is genuinely excellent. Helm locates it firmly in the Stockwell home of Nick and Laura and we become observers along with Laura and her trusty notepad as Nick is involved with phone calls between the Prime Minister and figures of global importance discussing highly sensitive matters which we overhear. How this refracts back through their daily life is endlessly fascinating: the top secret documents just lying around the house, her frustrations at not being able to write about these things, the tensions caused by her friendship with an ex who just happens to be a journalist, the casualness with which he discusses the PM with their Polish au pair, even the level of security necessary in their home, the level of detailing is just undeniably authentic and convincing. And Maxine Peake as Laura anchors the play with an exceptional performance. As a memoir, Laura oftens addresses the audience directly, looking back from some unspecified moment, and Peake delivers these with a grounded matter-of-factness and with a delightfully convivial tone as we are taken into her confidence. And in a wonderful moment I wish the Whingers would see, she gets out her piping bag and decorates her child’s birthday cake though they’d probably object to the licking of the spoon. She is matched excellently with Lloyd Owen’s harried Nick, trying to be all things to all people and trying to keep a steady hand on the tiller at an unimaginably difficult time. Ed Hall’s production adopts a small thrust at the Hampstead so that even though the stage is quite large, there is a cosy domestic feel here just right for the numerous scenes at they discuss things in bed (though equally exposing a few random details, a distractingly large hole in his sock, her putting on a baffling extra layer of nightwear!) the personal and political inextricably intertwined at a fascinating point in recent history, given a most relatable context. It’s a shame then that the second half eschews this to move to Downing Street and become something much more of a conventional drama. The focus shifts to the Prime Minister as invasion looms ever closer, looking at his strained relationship with the intelligence services and the major problems posed by the questionable legitimacy of one of their major sources who’d confirmed the presence of WMD. Helm manages to wangle Laura into Downing Street for this second half, but it is tenuously done she’s very much reduced to a passive role here. Consequently, the show loses some of its vitality – it still remains entertaining – but it doesn’t match up to the inventiveness of the opening act. And because the play occupies a funny territory between fact and fiction, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy at times with the way Helm writes. There’s a sense of score-settling that rears its head every so often, made all the more plain by the use of real names, so there’s a dig at ‘Cherie’ a propos of nothing and the simmering resentment at ‘Tony’ manifests itself in a number of tiny details, none of them flattering yet all designed to cement his place as the villain of the piece: the excuse of fictionalisation doesn’t really wash here and Patrick Baladi’s performance caught between a serious portrayal and an almost spoof-like approach. That this is contrasted with the virtual sainthood of ‘Laura’, an unflagging champion for the truth, stuck in the craw a little; the much needed hit of ambiguity as far as Nick’s character is concerned, acknowledging the murky complexity of having to actually deal with the reality of global politics, comes far too late for my liking."
1520,1520,Ought To Be Clowns,21/07/2018,Ian,For King and Country, Southwark Playhouse,"Belatedly, I found out that this play hasn’t been performed in London for 30-odd years and in this case, it is tempting to say you can see why. The intent behind John Wilson’s 1963 play For King and Country is certainly honorable, a courtroom drama about a WWI soldier who deserted his post. And Dilated Theatre’s production at the Southwark Playhouse has merit, the idea that it might serve as an investigation into the issues that we now label as PTSD. But a contemporary lens reflects harshly on the play, particularly through the prism of the writer’s decade. Watching his interpretation of what happened with our current knowledge of war’s psychological impact doesn’t feel like the most effective tribute to our armed forces as we commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War. My mind constantly wondered why we weren’t hearing either a) a fresh new piece of writing or b) something more historically direct.  As it is, the story of Private Hamp, a young man who after four long years on the battlefield, simply leaves the field after the Battle of Passchendaele. Caught at Calais and court-martialed for desertion, Wilson details the judicial process around the decision to send him to the firing squad. There’s an inkling that there’s a defence in the diminished capacity of his mental state but largely it is about the top brass’ determination to close ranks, stifle any further dissent, maintain a propriety in spite of the war-ravaged time."
1521,1521,Ought To Be Clowns,20/03/2020,Ian,La Ménagerie de Verre, Odéon-Théâtre de l’Europe,"In the grand scheme of things, missing out on an Ivo van Hove/Isabelle Huppert collaboration isn’t the end of the world but I can’t help but feel a little disappointed. La Ménagerie de Verre was due to come to the Barbican this summer but naturally I wanted to see this Odéon-Théâtre de l’Europe production in its Parisian home. As a co-production with La Comédie de Clermont-Ferrand scène nationale, Onassis Stegi in Athens, Les Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg, Thalia Theater in Hamburg, deSingel in Antwerp and the Barbican, one hopes that this won’t be the end for this production, we’ll have to see.  Any chance to see Huppert live should be snaffled up immediately, no matter how strange or how far, but there’s also something interesting in seeing Tennessee Williams done in a foreign language as released from the distracting tyranny of trying to nail a Southern accent, the potential for something richer seems to flow.   In the meantime, these Isabelle Huppert bloopers are one of the things that give me the most joy in my life, especially the couple of minutes from 3.26 onwards."
1522,1522,Ought To Be Clowns,17/06/2010,Ian,Welcome to Thebes, National Theatre,"Any play that can use the epithet “your mother-f*cking brother” with complete accuracy has to be worth your attention and sure enough, Welcome to Thebes, a new play by Moira Buffini opening in the Olivier auditorium at the National Theatre, is more than equal to the challenge. The play is quite huge in scope, it looks at the role of women in politics, the state of Africa, the aftermath of war, the relationship between Africa and the West, the tragedy of child soldiers and it tells of them through the prism of Greek mythology, but relocated to the modern day and an unspecified (West) African state. So we have the story of a female president-elect, Eurydice, struggling to exert herself in both her domestic situation in a country reeling from years of civil war, but also in the male-dominated world of international relations as she needs to establish links with global superpower Athens for much needed aid and investment by engaging with its charismatic leader, Theseus. The clearest analogy to make is with Liberia, the only African state to have an elected female leader of state in Ellen Johnson Sirleaf who came to power after the concerted efforts of a mass movement of women hungry for peace after years of civil war. And if Thebes equates to Liberia, then Athens becomes the United States, the superpower and apparent bastion of democracy but unwilling to provide assistance without considerable caveats; Theseus being an Obama-like leader with a touch more arrogance. Circumstances had led happily to me attending this with an old friend visiting from Canada who works in the conflict management arena and has a particular interest in developing West African countries so it could not have been better planned if we tried. And it was very interesting to see how convincing she found much of what was depicted onstage. Buffini is really alive to the alternative politics suggested by a female-dominated administration as currently demonstrated in Rwanda, and given colourful, amusing life by a trio of ace supporting performances. Aïcha Kossoko as the pragmatic, no-nonsense Foreign Secretary Aglaea, Joy Richardson as the sympathetic Thalia Minister of Justice and a warm Pamela Nomvete as Finance Minister Euprosyne were all excellent, struggling to come to terms with the horrors of a seemingly endless civil war and the situation they find themselves in in dealing with the bureaucracy of the world’s most powerful nation, but ultimately undaunted by their task in hand. Nikki Amuka-Bird had a job in convincing me that she’d be ok given that the last time I saw her was in the execrable The Gods Weep but I was blown away by her powerful, passionate performance of a woman finding her way in “the politics of dire need”, fighting opposition from so many sides and desperate for Athens to believe in what she is doing in rebuilding her country, she fills the stage well with her presence. David Harewood is an actor of whom I am not particularly fond but he was impressive as the manipulative Theseus and the relationship and power games played between the two leaders were well done as they struggle to come to any kind of working agreement. Chuk Iwuji was terrifyingly convincing as the leader of the opposition, any resemblance to Charles Taylor I’m sure was totally coincidental(!) and his partner in crime, Rakie Ayola’s cobra-like Pargeia possessed of a glacial calm, brought a real sense of danger to the fragile political situation. Elsewhere I enjoyed Jacqueline Defferary’s frustrated peacekeeper Talthybia, a woman who’s grown to love and understand the country she’s stationed in but as much a victim of patronising sexism from her own leader Theseus as the women of the ‘less-developed’ country, the stunning Tracy Ifeachor as Ismene desperate to get the hell out of Dodge and a raw, impassioned Madeline Appiah. Fans of Wicked might be interested to see that Alexia Khadime turns up in the ensemble here as the guide of the blind seer Tiresias and sings a couple of laments but she has little real role to play in the drama. The use of Greek mythology is largely well done, bits from various tales have been stitched together here into a new whole and the analogy works, to most of us the world of child soldiers and violent civil unrest is as alien to us as the world of the Ancient Greeks and their gods and yet the beliefs in the spirit world is a connection between the two. However, the tension between the epic and the everyday was often highlighted by the disparities between the epic language used, with its talk of the gods and overarching concepts, and the modern day slang “you are my bitch” that permeates much of the conversation. The set design was fairly simplistic: a ruined palace as a backdrop with a barren sand and rock-filled desolation surrounding. Given the staging opportunities in the Olivier, it initially felt a little underwhelming but in actual fact served to concentrate the attention on the acting and story-telling, something perhaps a little underestimated in productions like Women Beware Women with its giant revolve. The quiet moments were often the strongest, the moving moment when the child soldier First Lieutenant was asked his real name, Ismene’s desperate attempt to leave the country where she is so unhappy, the Cabinet’s brief moment of self-doubt in the conference “we like to wear comfortable shoes…”. Welcome to Thebes offers a timely reminder that the developed world really does need to learn better ways of communicating with the Third World if we’re to ever to seriously tackle the problems of global poverty, but also adds a more universal thread in considering the greater role that women ought to play in politics, no matter the country. Recommended. Yes, there are some great elements in this production and I agree that Nikki Amuka-Bird's performance is superb. http://boycottingtrends.blogspot.com/2010/06/welcome-to-thebes-national-theatre.html Nice review. I found one of its strongest points to be how it dealt with the role that women are having to play in politics in Third World countries, the scene with the introductions of the cabinet to Theseus was classic and a nice skewering of how more 'senior' politicians expect to be treated, but very few other reviews seemed to have picked up on this, I wonder why. Orthodox, state-subsidised tosh,  this play was about as dramatic as The One Show.  Strictly for adherents of what Mamet calls ""Pseudodrama"" – ie theatre that allows the audience to be pleased with itself.  About as challenging as – well, the One Show.  And all rather pretentiously and quite unnecessarily wrapped up in Greek myth.  How about spending the money on a production of a real play?  Antigone, say?"
1523,1523,Ought To Be Clowns,24/09/2012,Ian,Sunset Baby, Gate Theatre,"Forming the final part of the Gate Theatre’s RESIST! season, Dominique Morisseau’s Sunset Baby is a fierce ball of familial recriminations, fatherly regret and flawed characters. Kenyatta Shakur, along with his wife Ashanti X, was a figurehead of the Black Revolutionary movement and not even fatherhood could mellow him as he continued the struggle and served time inside for his trouble. His wife died from her drug addictions and all that is left is Nina, his daughter, whose feelings of estrangement burn brighter than ever, even when he begins the process of trying to reconcile with her. Michelle Asante’s Nina is a bolshy, self-assured presence, adamant in her unshakeable view of the world that she constantly rails against. With her boyfriend Damon, they deal drugs and run robbery scams together, and she does not take kindly to the reappearance of Ben Onwukwe’s Kenyatta in her life, especially once she figures out what she thinks is his ulterior motive. Ashanti left a stash of love letters from her husband to Nina in her will and having had their considerable value assessed, she’s unwilling to let them go without securing the right price. Asante burns with a barely suppressed fury as Nina, staring the world straight in the face and never blinking, but she also has a firm grasp on the young woman behind the mask, the make-up, the forthright get-up she wears in public. She really makes us feel for the person that could be, yet seethe with frustration as she acts out against her father, unwittingly making the same mistakes that he did. Despite the set-up, Onwukwe emerges as the sympathetic heart of the piece with his highly compassionate performance, throwing up the question about whether a man can ever simultaneously be a true revolutionary and a good father and what, if anything, is an acceptable price to pay. "
1524,1524,Ought To Be Clowns,07/01/2015,Ian,Treasure Island, National Theatre,"The big family-oriented show at the National Theatre this winter is Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island (though as it runs in rep right through to April, one hopes Spring will have sprung by then) which has been adapted for the stage by Bryony Lavery. But whilst Polly Findlay’s production has some very definite plus points, not least in an inspired design by Lizzie Clachan which utilises so much of the Olivier’s potential, it doesn’t quite have the full shiver-me-timbers factor to make it an undoubted success. Clachan frames the theatre’s large revolving drum with a set of lowering curved ribs which suggest all kinds of mystical maritime adventures – the frame of a trusty ship, the ribcage of a giant whale, the quivering trees of a strange island. Deep in the revolve is where the real treasure is though, a warren of cabins that reflect the social hierarchy of the time and later on the maze of tunnels in which the gold can be found. Combined with the sensational starry skyscape up above, Bruno Poet’s lighting looking stunning, this is the National doing what it does so well. Which makes it a shame that the drama just isn’t that dramatic. Lavery’s adaptation is full of innovation – some inspired, turning Jim Hawkins into Jemima and making Dr Livesey a woman too; some less so, the puzzling prevalence of bearded ladies – but the filleting of the novel into a play never really captures sufficient magic to make it truly light up the stage. Indeed it relies a little too heavily on previous knowledge which is dangerous considering the target audience and there are stretches of the production that consequently fall close to the perfunctory. But there are real highlights too, especially Patsy Ferran’s androgynous Jim whose inquisitive sprightliness is a real boon and a quietly commanding central presence. Helena Lymbery’s doctor has a lovely warmth about her and Joshua James’ wild boy Ben Gunn is a kinetic, cheese-obsessed, thrill as he toys with the pirates who left him behind. Arthur Darvill’s Long John Silver is a suave surprise – perhaps lacking some of villainous charisma one might associate with the role but convincing much more as someone who could insinuate his way into impressionable minds."
1525,1525,Ought To Be Clowns,27/06/2012,Ian,Kiss Me, Kate,"So confident in their run of successful summer musicals is Chichester Festival Theatre that the transfer for Kiss Me, Kate (it will play at co-producers London’s Old Vic from 20th November to 2nd March) was announced before it had even opened at its native theatre. But with experienced hands Trevor Nunn directing and Stephen Mears choreographing, Cole Porter’s ever-spry music and a cast headed up by leading light of the British musical theatre scene Hannah Waddingham, it was a reasonably safe bet. And unsurprisingly, it is one that has paid off. The show follows a theatre company putting on a musical version of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, where the feisty relationship between Petruchio and Katherine is echoed by the conflict between director and leading man Fred and his ex-wife Lilli who is playing opposite him. As the offstage drama threatens to overwhelm the onstage, some shenanigans from another member of the company in a gambling room throws matters further into disarray. Sam and Bella Spewack’s book intertwines the Bard’s plot with that of their own invention but though there’s a neat dovetailing, the story lacks a genuinely engaging heart, the emotional charge that would keep us thoroughly invested. Instead, it is Cole Porter’s vibrant music (including such classics as ‘So in Love’ and ‘I’m Always True To You (In My Fashion)’ and witty lyrics – a whole song rhymed around Bianca… – that grabs the attention, especially in the sparklingly fresh musical arrangements by Gareth Valentine.
Nunn’s production suffers from a similar dichotomy: outside of the musical numbers, it has a rather languid feel, stretching out to three hours, and consequently contains too little of the sharpness it needs to make the heart beat faster or for the comedy really bite. Mears’ choreography is extremely elegant, though perhaps lacking a little fresh imagination and sometimes adds to a pace which could skip a little faster throughout. It is of course excellently performed though. Alex Bourne brings an effective swagger to the garrulous Fred, determined that the show must go on, but the evening belongs to Hannah Waddingham. Vocally dextrous and clear as a crystalline bell, she oozes star quality and the requisite Hollywood glamour as Lilli, but ultimately theirs is never a romance that the show never really gets 100% behind, there’s little sense of the gravity of the decisions being made – instead things just happen. Samuel Holmes and Kevin Brewis match up well with Adam Garcia as Bianca’s suitors – Holly Dale Spencer gives a cracking turn, though Garcia comes into his own with every effortlessly flawless dance move he makes; there’s some luxury casting with Clive Rowe and David Burt as a pair of cartoonish gangsters given to a vaudeville turn; and Jason Pennycooke leads the ensemble in a thrilling opening to Act 2 to the tune of ‘Too Darn Hot’. With the bar having been set so very high by last summer’s musical successes – Singin’ in the Rain and Sweeney Todd – it is hard not to feel just a little disappointed that Kiss Me, Kate doesn’t quite meet that superlative standard. What we have though is still highly enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. Nice review: agree that Adam Garcia dances like a dream. He must bathe in the blood of virgins too, hardly seems to have aged a day!"
1526,1526,Ought To Be Clowns,14/08/2017,Ian,Glorious, Frinton Summer Theatre,"Between Maureen Lipman in the West End and Meryl Streep in Hollywood, the story of notorious singer Florence Foster Jenkins has become much more widely known over the last decade. It does however remain one that I had somehow avoided and so the chance to see see the Peter Quilter play Glorious! with the marvellous Stella Gonet in the lead was one I gladly took. It also meant my first trip to the Frinton Summer Theatre out by the seaside in Essex. Foster Jenkins’ insistence on pursuing a career as a soprano of note had one major flaw in her lack of singing ability but with a family legacy able to pay enough yesmen to shield her from any negative reaction and the force of her good nature, a striking journey was established. And in Quilter’s play, it a journey we witness through the eyes of her new pianist Cosmé McMoon, taken on to accompany Foster Jenkins at her 1944 concert at none other than Carnegie Hall. Glorious! is a play that finds all sorts of easy laughs in the sheer comic improbability of this woman’s chutzpah, her focus and determination that this is her chosen path bulldozing any sense of reason. But Quilter rarely makes the more challenging step to dig a little deeper and question what was really going on – was it self-delusion or merely self-satisfaction, what was really going through his protagonist’s mind to keep her so firmly resolute."
1527,1527,Ought To Be Clowns,20/02/2020,Ian,Dual دوگانه, VAULT Festival,"There’s a cracking energy at the heart of Dual دوگانه  that marks it out from many of the other solo shows that pepper the programme at the VAULT Festival, really testing the limits of what a one-person show can achieve. Spoken word lip synching, (videoed) puppetry and animation, gameshows, audience-led revolutions, drag performance, poetry, pop – there’s whole worlds packed into this hour. Writer/performer Peyvand Sadeghian draws deeply from her personal history here. Born in Canning Town to mixed heritage, the process of becoming a naturalised British citizen age 8 threw up issues when trying to visit her extended family in Iran a couple of years later. Not accepting British citizenship there, she had to get an Iranian passport, and name, and somehow ensure safe passage home, all laying further claim to an already tangled identity.  What follows is a first-hand exploration of just something of what it means to be multicultural, specifically through the prism of British-Iranian international relations but also more widely as ideas of dual citizenship and the realities of possessing a certain nationality start to bite more than ever before (waves at Colin…). And as Sadeghian pushes for revolution – cos that’s the answer right? Overthrow whichever regime is oppressing you, right? – there’s a sensitive study of just how much that might cost, both personally and politically."
1528,1528,Ought To Be Clowns,28/04/2015,mag9l,, Lyric Hammersmith,"I don’t think even now I really believe that the kids in the film of Bugsy Malone aren’t actually singing – like with Father Christmas and the future for Wigan Athletic, I choose to believe. Fortunately, there’s no such doubt in Sean Holmes’ production of the show, written by Alan Parker with music and lyrics by Paul Williams, a mammoth run of which has been chosen to inaugurate the newly refurbished Lyric Hammersmith. It’s the first professional production in over a decade of this inimitable Chicago gangster classic and Holmes and children’s casting director Jessica Ronane have pulled together a group of exceptionally talented youngsters who sing live, dance, act and fire splurge guns aplenty Having seen the show twice now, it is remarkable how different the energy was between the two sets of child performers I got to see, they’ve clearly been encouraged to establish their own mark on their roles and it’s a joy to behold. Max Gill’s Fat Sam is an absolute scene-stealing delight, absolutely nailing the comic timing and slapdash slapstick of this hapless boss whereas Sasha Gray captured more of the attention as a supremely confident Bugsy in his group; Thea Lamb’s achingly soulful voice fills her Blousey full of longing, compared to a perkier turn from Zoe Brough; and I couldn’t pick between Asanda Jezile and Samantha Allison as Tallulah, both shining as this most sardonic of songstresses. Alongside this talented group, the production’s other secret weapon is Drew McOnie’s fabulously fresh choreography. Whilst certainly evoking the instantly recognisable dance moves of the era, he also injects a real vibrancy into the routines here – ‘Bad Guys’ thus drops the rolled-up carpet to deliver a genius silent-movie inspired dance break, the beautiful ache of ‘Tomorrow’ is echoed in barefoot contemporary, and ‘So You Wanna Be A Boxer’ uses grunting, punchbags, skipping ropes and a whole lot more besides in Jon Bausor’s inventive yet practical design to become an unalloyed highlight of the evening. Not to mention that finale. THAT FINALE! Encores will never be the same, especially as played by Phil Bateman’s exceptional band. "
1529,1529,Ought To Be Clowns,07/06/2015,mag9l,Now This Is Not The End, Arcola,"Eva’s memory is failing, daughter Susan recorded some of her recollections of her youth in Berlin but the cassette has gone missing and her daughter Rosie couldn’t care less, having adopted Berlin as her new home, withdrawing from the very family connection that her mother is trying to preserve. Skittering between London and Berlin and over the course of more than a decade, Rose Lewenstein’s Now This Is Not The End is a slight but serious piece of drama that eloquently explores how we’re moulded by our families, no matter how much emotional or physical distance we try to put between us. Katie Lewis’ production is strongest when these three women are interacting, demonstrating that even though they’re trying the opposite, they’re carrying so much of their family legacy down from one generation to the next. Brigit Forsyth’s Eva subtly suggesting that her aloofness isn’t just a symptom of the early stages of her condition, Wendy Nottingham’s brittle Susan trying and failing not to repeat the lessons of the past, and Jasmine Blackborow’ spiky Rosie rather achingly looking for a sense of her own identity in a world with no easy answers. Lewenstein conjures the emotional world of this family excellently with her writing – full of the ease and exasperation that comes hand in hand with challenging family members and cleverly extended by the three male characters, – Bernard Lloyd’s irascible Arnold fussing around Eva, Andrew Whipp’s Sudoku-obsessed Paul ever-protective of Susan and Daniel Donskoy’s beguilingly handsome Sebastian, unwilling to let Rosie go. They’re each subsidiary roles though, they mainly serve as adjuncts to the woman they’re attached to, and there are other moments too where one wishes Lewenstein had stretched her play a little more."
1530,1530,Ought To Be Clowns,18/06/2014,mag9l,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Park Theatre,"Westerns have never been my thing so The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was all brand new information for me. Jethro Compton’s production uses Dorothy M Johnson’s original short story as its primary source material rather than the more famous film and purely by virtue of putting a Western on a stage, possesses something unique as it is a genre that has barely been touched, at least in my memory, by any London theatre. And it is also a surprisingly effective treatment that makes it one of the more atmospheric shows of the year. Compton errs towards something of a cinematic style – Jonny Sims’ music swoops around the theatre, Robert Vaughan’s voice as a narrator guides us through the story, and Sarah Booth’s single set design contains all the action, told as it is largely in flashback. The plot doesn’t hold too much surprise so I’ll say little about it here but the play is best when it focuses on the love triangle between Oliver Lansley’s lawyer Ransome Foster, Niamh Walsh’s illiterate bar owner Hallie and Paul Albertson’s Barricune who rescued Ransome from a tight spot."
1531,1531,Ought To Be Clowns,04/07/2008,Ian,Avenue Q with Daniel Boys, Noël Coward,"Change always encroaches though and a major overhaul of the cast meant that this visit, the first for a while, was filled with a little trepidation at how these changes would affect the show that has become so dear to me. Any Dream Will Do alumnus Daniel Boys takes over as Princeton and Rod and brings a similar wide-eyed freshness to Princeton as Jon Robyns did which is what the role really needs. His Rod was a little too much for me, too mincingly camp and not convincing enough, I think he needs to be careful not to overdo it in order to keep the audience reaction on the right side of homophobia! Mark Goldthorp as Nicky and Trekkie impressed me as he is required to be so versatile and lived up the challenge really well, even investing his Bad Idea Bear with an extra naughty glint in the eye. Christopher Fry as Brian is much less goofy and at times too subtle for what is a broad comic character (he sings a song called ‘I’m Not Wearing Underwear Today’ for Christ’s sake) and so I’m not sure this is the right direction to go with this character. Edward Baruwa has settled into his Gary Coleman role ok and Yanle Zhong’s Christmas Eve remains good. Which then leads us onto Rebecca Lock as Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut. Now one of the main reasons I have seen this show so much has been for Julie Atherton’s performance, one of the greatest and most appealing I think I’ll ever see and so Lock clearly has a lot to live up to on my part, but I really found her to be disappointing. Playing Kate as less of the innocent ingénue and more of a worldly-wise woman removes so much of the innocence from her storyline and resulting in a much less nuanced performance which veers too close to slapstick. Vocally, she is not weak but similarly she did not impress and needed to watch her clarity on several numbers."

1533,1533,Ought To Be Clowns,08/02/2015,Ian,Little Light, Orange Tree,"Critics went cock-a-hoop for Alice Birch’s Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again at the RSC yesterday but my first experience of her writing came with Many Moons at Theatre503 in 2011 and a fantastic one it was too. Little Light, which forms part of Paul Miller’s reinvigorating opening season at the Orange Tree, was actually the first play she ever wrote and directed here by David Mercatali, receives a startling premiere which confirms Birch’s status as one to watch. Little Light starts strongly as a disturbed domestic drama. There are strains evident in Teddy and Alison’s relationship from the start, as they prepare for a special meal in their seaside converted barn, tension crackling as the rituals they have always observed end up slightly off-kilter. They’re waiting for her sister Clarissa but she arrives heavily pregnant and followed unexpectedly by her bedraggled lover Simon, a further deviation from which the occasion spirals out of control into a vortex of grief-fuelled chaos. When the air of ambiguity is wafting around Madeleine Girling’s dust-sheet covered design, which extends even up to the first floor here, the strangeness of the play is a fiercely compelling force. Disjointed, enigmatic speech refuses to settle into any easy rhythm, Max Pappenheim’s soundscape builds an irrefutable creeping sense of horror and as a spiky sibling rivalry comes to a head, taking the unknowing newcomer as a prisoner in its war games, the tension that Mercatali builds is unbearable. But as it is shattered by the terrible revelations that surely come, there’s a slight sense that this is the work of a writer still coming into her talent. Heavy-handed symbolism leaves as dodgy a taste as that fish pie surely does and the way in which the crucial information comes to light – in two long-winded monologues that wrap up the night – feel too much like naked emotional manipulation, determined to make one cry in its tragedy (and succeeding with a fair few) but effectively disconnecting characters from the world of the play."
1534,1534,Ought To Be Clowns,26/10/2012,Ian,The Horror! The Horror!, Wilton’s Music Hall,"Much like we all carry our own sense of humour with us, we all too have our own individual fears and dreads. Which means we don’t all find the same things funny (I barely laughed in One Man, Two Guvnors for example) and, as Hallowe’en fast approaches, it makes it difficult to guarantee that something is scary for everyone. A proliferation of shows across London are all determined to send shivers down our spine, but none can have been so initially successful as Theatre of the Damned’s The Horror! The Horror! which sold out its run at Wilton’s Music Hall before it had even started. As the main hall is being renovated, this Victorian-era promenade show takes place in the shadowy spaces and ramshackle rooms upstairs at Wilton’s and takes the form of a sneak preview of the new season of work from A.S. Brownlow & Company, a group of performers whose acts have all taken something of a gruesome turn. From saucy singers provoking mysterious men to vengeful magicians bitterly resisting the arrival of the future, a cabaret of the grisly and ghastly emerges from the ghosts of the past. And there are puppies. Oh, the puppies. With a series of perfectly judged songs by Jeffrey Mayhew which conjure the spirits of performances past in this most unique of historical venues, a vibrant music hall atmosphere is set right from the start with pre-show entertainment taking place in the bar. And Stewart Pringle’s book occupies similar terrain, augmenting the turns that we see with snippets of personal history, suggesting the difficulties and frustrations that marked the lives of such performers, touring the country to earn their living. The opening sequence is the strongest, marrying all the elements of the production excellently, but the logistics of the evening preclude too much scariness ever building up. The eeriness that is cleverly evoked by Tom Richards’ MCing as Brownlow and Ben Goffe’s steward Baker before each scene unfortunately has too much time to dissipate as we’re marshalled from room to room, from thrill to spill, the noise from the working bar below not really helping (though at the same time, it feels churlish to deny Wilton’s the profits) to maintain the ambience. And the length of the vignettes is a shade too protracted given the promenading, proceedings not always immediately engaging and sometimes taking a little too long before their shocking climaxes. An element of this has to come from the audience though, a willingness to be complicit in soul-chilling shenanigans and the performers face a new challenge with every group in trying to figure out its dynamics. I’m admittedly a bit of a sceptic when it comes to horror – it takes little girl ghosts and/or puppets to freak me out – and so The Horror! The Horror! didn’t really connect to what I find scary. But it is atmospheric and undoubtedly strongly performed – Alicia Bennett and Kate Quinn’s singers are excellent and James Utechin and Fiona Rene build up a convincing chemistry as a pair of would-be elopers – and the way that some of the shocks unfold has a genuinely creepy power.  Our experience was ruined by the rudest woman who insisted on pushing to the front of every scene, and then pulling her two friends with her. The ushers really ought to take a but more care to ensure that this behaviour doesn't happen as it spoils the show for us all. I thought the passé chauvinist humour was entirely without irony and mainly in bad taste. Jokes relating to people who are fat, small people and those 'from Up North' were predictable, lazy and importantly simply not funny. The actors were let down by the script throughout. Although the lyrics of the signature song were better than anything else. The £15 is a stretch to far for this production. 2/5"
1535,1535,Ought To Be Clowns,03/12/2011,Ian,Howl’s Moving Castle, Southwark Playhouse,"Though not intended to be, this is a review of a preview. I was booked into the press night for Howl’s Moving Castle at the Southwark Playhouse but the creative team behind the show needed more time to work through some technical challenges and so the press night was delayed by a few days. My diary being what it is, I could not reschedule. This is the first stage adaptation of one of Diana Wynne Jones’ novels – though this was memorably animated by Studio Ghibli into a gorgeous film version – and director/designer team Davy and Kristin McGuire have taken a massive step up from their miniature theatre show The Icebook which combined paper cutouts with video work to create an exquisite pop-up book to create a full-scale festive show at the Southwark Playhouse. The ambition at work here is quite considerable and the initial impact of the design with its giant cut-out storybook castle is fantastic. And as the video work starts on the blank screens either side of the castle, it’s clear that this is something quite different. It’s not a story that immediately springs to mind as one that could be transported onto the stage but Mize Sizemore’s adaptation is cleverly done, paring back the tale to just four characters. Sophie is an 18 year old girl working in a hat shop who unintentionally angers the Witch of the Waste who then casts a spell, turning her into an old woman. To try and break free, Sophie ends up in the home of mysterious wizard Howl, whose flying castle can move between time, space and all manner of dimensions but along this journey, she discovers that she is not the only one in need of rescue. The use of video and computer generated imagery means that the scope of the show can thus cope with the above demands. We flit from place to place effortlessly and often with great visual aplomb, and there’s several moments of smaller intimate magic, the path of a butterfly traced across the theatre being my favourite. And it is well performed: Daniel Ings is excellent as Howl, a manic presence as the elusive wizard but one who is always engagingly warm, connecting particularly well with Calcifer his fire demon, voiced characterfully by James Wilkes. And Susan Sheridan does well as the aged version of Sophie, capturing the wide-eyed wonder of our heroine but also something of the maturity beyond her years that to keep us invested in her fate. Stephen Fry’s voice is also employed as a narrator to keep things on track lest the story should get away from us, which was a less successful innovation – two voiced-over characters out of five felt one too many. But in compressing the story into just over an hour and devoting so much energy and resource to the creative ingenuity at work, there’s little complexity left on the stage. It may be trailed as a family show but there’s little by the way of exploration of the characters or their motivations which makes it at times a rather dull dramatic experience – too often, there is just the one actor on stage working with too little material. I wasn’t keen either on Kristen McGuire’s over-emphatic performance as the Witch of the Waste which appears to have been based on Susan Sarandon’s turn in the film Enchanted, in the way she looks, acts and moves. This reduces her to a pantomime villain of sorts which just doesn’t fit in with the rest of the show: where she could have played gone truly wicked or more damaged in order to make things scarier or more tragic, instead there are clumsily broad strokes and the kind of mwah-hah-hahs that can never be taken seriously. More often than not when the director’s name appears elsewhere on the cast/creatives list as well, it is not the best thing and sadly, I think that is the case here."
1536,1536,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,The Limit, VAULT Festival,"Ooh, a real treat this. The world of new musical theatre can be a little unforgiving but on the evidence of The Limit, Freya Smith and Jack Williams’ Bottle Cap Theatre are marking themselves as ones to watch out for. Their musical celebrates the unsung life and unheralded achievements of French mathematician Sophie Germain and it does so with real spirit and success. The DNA of shows like Hamilton and Six are certainly palpable here, in a refreshingly contemporary approach to its historical subject and to be frank, these are fantastic influences to be drawing from. It instantly imbues the relationships and happenings with a relatability that speaks just as much truth (if not more) than any rendition of ‘historical accuracy’ could hope for.  Living in 18th century Paris, the expectations for Germain were clearly set out as a young woman of society. But far more fascinated by her father’s library than following the rules, she found ways of feeding her own intellect. Nicola Bernardelle plays her with a real warmth and hunger that makes her fight one you can’t help but root for. And having the freedom to play early scenes for comedy rather than dusty authenticity, her battles with her mother over hoop skirts and disastrous matchmaking are perfectly pitched – Rachel Delooze and George Naylor both sparking so well off of her charming forthrightness. Jamal Franklin also impresses as Poisson, Germain’s colleague with his own agenda. There are serious points here too. The pernicious attitudes to female education, the potential that has long been wasted, society’s slowness to recognise those whose legacies have been neglected (the Eiffel Tower snub calls to mind Rosalind Franklin’s own for the Nobel Prize). But while taking this seriously, the writing also wears it lightly, never forgetting to entertain. Alfie Taylor-Gaunt’s nifty pieces of choreography are fun but it is the score that is constantly engaging and enlightening. The percussion rolls (Tim Harvey) and bass lines (James Pugliese) are particularly delicious in the song I’m calling ‘How A Woman Works’ and all huddled together to the side of the stage, there’s a great feeling of a proper band just having a jamming session. "
1537,1537,Ought To Be Clowns,05/07/2014,mag9l,Love Story, Octagon,"Just a quickie for this most beloved of shows. The CFT production of Love Story that failed to take the West End by storm back in 2010 was a thing of sheer loveliness and Howard Goodall’s luscious score has to rank among my all-time favourites, I really do think it is that beautiful. So all future productions have a high benchmark to live up to – there was a low-key version at the Brockley Jack last year and this year, we have Elizabeth Newman’s production for the Bolton Octagon. And what a lovely thing it is. Unafraid to be delicately simple and flirting with actor-musicianship in Ciaran Bagnall’s cleverly designed set, it is a deeply musical take on the soaring romance of the story that glides speedily through the relationship between Daniel Boys’ college jock Oliver Barrett IV and Lauren Samuels’ wisecracking musician Jennifer Cavilleri. From the chemistry of their ‘opposites attract’ first meeting to the heartbreaking sadness of the end, it’s a beautiful piece of work."
1538,1538,Ought To Be Clowns,18/10/2014,Ian,MilkMilkLemonade, Ovalhouse,"I knew I’d like MilkMilkLemonade from the moment I read the publicity which introduced the word ‘bittersilly’ into my lexicon, a twist on the bittersweet realities of growing up different that reflects the persuasive, almost daft charm of Joshua Conkel’s writing. From the outset, it’s clear we’re in for something alternative (alt-country, even) as James Turner’s design has us sat on a circle of haybales with chickens made of balloons all around and a nervy narrator introducing us to the homespun delights of life on the chicken farm for Emory and his Nanna.  Naturally it’s not quite what it seems as Elliot and Emory do play together but not in the heterosexual way Nanna demands, but rather playing a twisted version of house in which they experiment sexually and socially with their gender roles. This is something Rebecca Atkinson-Lord’s production plays up beautifully in its casting choices – Benedict Hopper drags up brilliantly as the vehement Nanna but Sophie Steer brings a real thought-provoking quality to Elliot, asking questions about how gender roles are constructed for boys (and for girls) in the desperation to present a butch façade. But for all the serious issues flying around, it is the humour that brings the boys to the yard as Conkel lets his imagination run riot. Georgia Buchanan’s lady-in-leotard is the most blessed recipient here as she variously fulfils the role of narrator, the deadly but darling spider Rochelle, the parasitic twin living in Elliot’s thigh, the translator of Linda’s chicken-speak and the living embodiment of Starlene who near steals the show with a fabulous rendition of ‘I’ve Never Been To Me’. Released from the confines of the narrative, Buchanan truly revels in the playful freedom accorded to her."
1539,1539,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Much Ado About Nothing, Gray’s Inn Hall,"Bienvenue à la Place de Messina pour Beaucoup de bruit pour rien. For Antic Disposition’s take on Much Ado About Nothing relocates Shakespeare’s evergreen comedy in the summer of 1945 in a village in rural France. War is over, the checked tablecloths are out, the vin rosé (or Orangina si tu veux) is flowing and with an Anglo-French company, a hugely characterful take on the play emerges. Drawing on the influence of Jacques Tati to deliver a unique blend of physical comedy and neatly observed verse-reading, co-directors Ben Horslen and John Risebero transport the play effortlessly into this new milieu. Louis Bernard’s Dogberry is a complete revelation in this respect, a constant presence since he’s the manager of the village bar and to be honest, I could watch a whole play of him just bumbling about with his comic shenanigans.  This bolder comic style also bleeds through to this Benedick and Béatrice. Nicholas Osmond blusters well but it is Chiraz Aïch whose confidence and compassion really impresses. And they’re balanced well by a sweetly matched Floriane Andersen and Alexander Varey as Hero and Claudio, though the strength of the funny stuff makes to long for the Watch (which is something I never thought I’d say!).   The venue for this production is also of real interest as it is one which isn’t normally publicly accessible. Gray’s Inn Hall is one of the few remaining original Shakespearean venues, having hosted the first recorded performance of The Comedy of Errors in 1594 and is a hugely atmospheric and idiosyncratic space. The staging in long traverse necessarily produces some clever innovations – the gulling scenes contain much more hiding in plain sight than you’d ever think would work, and there’s much fun in smashing the fourth wall."
1540,1540,Ought To Be Clowns,11/06/2014,mag9l,No Barriers with Barriers, Rowans Bowling Alley,"There can’t be too many theatrical experiences that take place in a working bowling alley but over at Rowan’s Bowling Alley in Finsbury Park, that is exactly what you’ll find in No Barriers With Barriers. The real life No Barriers With Barriers bowling club was set up by Peter Faventi and Ray Downing to create the most inclusive environment possible for a bowling team (all ages allowed, and they play with the bumpers up, hence the name!) and their experiences led them to develop something that would combine their two loves of theatre and bowling. And what a ‘something’ that is. Devised theatre can often feel like a collection of disparate pieces barely held together but here, the central thread of the 54th edition of the Rowans’ Championship Cup provides an engaging framework from start to finish, seeing three teams competing over a full game of 10 frames. And in amongst the bowling, we get to explore some of the stories of the players – their lives, their loves, their backgrounds, their aspirations and as if that wasn’t enough, at any moment we’re subject to a pop quiz on some aspect or other of bowling. With our special bowling shirts on (given on arrival), a pulsing pop soundtrack and the wonderfully charismatic compering of Norm and Norm (Downing, and Barry Churchill), it is impossible not to be seduced by the fun of it all. Getting to meet fierce rival teams the Lightning Riders and the King Pins; seeing Sarah, Lisa and Roger (from Finance) stumble into the venue looking for their corporate team-building day; and then watching them all get thoroughly stuck in to knocking those pins down is a simple but highly effective starting point, it’s impossible not to root for people when they get a strike whilst not even looking at where they’re bowling! But the piece gains real power in the second act, in the pauses between frames, as we delve into the personal. Stories of fraught birthday parties at Wimpy and Beckham mohawks gone wrong remind us how long and deep childhood traumas can linger, the sweetest of love stories rears its head (and brilliantly its not the fact that they’re both girls, or different races, but their opposing teams that is the biggest issue) and the way that cheating robs people of the genuine joy of participation is movingly evoked in a powerful speech by Faventi’s Striker."
1541,1541,Ought To Be Clowns,28/05/2013,Ian,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Theatre Royal Drury Lane,"“It’s the a-choc-alypse…no, it’s choc-mageddon” What to do when a golden ticket is actually thrust into one’s hand?! A late invitation to a very early preview of new big budget musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meant a hurried trip to the newly refurbished Theatre Royal Drury Lane to see what has to be one of the most highly anticipated productions of the year with Sam Mendes directing, Peter Darling choreographing and Douglas Hodge taking on the role of Willy Wonka. Given the huge success of fellow Roald Dahl adaptation Matilda, the stakes on this multi-million production are substantial and a month long preview period is testament to how much the team want to test the show before opening night.  Where Charlie might suffer, unlike Matilda, is in the enduring memory of the iconic film version from 1971. When Hodge appears at the door of his factory, you can sense the sigh of relief as he looks ‘right’, as in definitely inspired by Gene Wilder’s take on the character; when the doors open on the Chocolate room, there’s a slight sense of disappointment which is perhaps inevitable as the logistics of creating a chocolate waterfall and river come up hard against what appears to be a giant curly-wurly (hopefully there’s more to be done here). So consequently much of my emotional reaction to the show actually came from preconceived notions – tears came in anticipation of Charlie unwrapping the all-important chocolate bar rather than because of it, the goosebumps at the climactic elevator ride came from the sneaky use of Bricusse and Newley’s ever lovely ‘Pure Imagination’ (the only song to make it from the film) as the lift itself wasn’t ready to be used and apparently the cause of earlier previews being cancelled. There are moments of theatrical magic that the show thoroughly owns for itself though, most notably for me the way in which the other children are revealed as they each get their golden tickets being the undoubted highlight of the first half. Jamie Harrison’s illusion work brings a couple of lovely moments too and the Act 1 closer, ‘It Must Be Believed To Be Seen’, is a great introductory number for Hodge’s Wonka. The opening Quentin Blake-inspired video which details the making of chocolate is excellent too though perhaps a little long for the younger viewer. The use of Jon Driscoll’s projection in the second act enlivens the trip around the factory where perhaps a little more originality could make the set pieces themselves sparkle a little more. The Oompa-Loompas are well done, and pleasingly large in number which fills the stage well, though it’s a real shame that their iconic theme tune isn’t used here (especially if ‘Pure Imagination’ is being borrowed) and there’s a misjudged disco moment which seems mainly designed to give them a costume which allows the actors to stretch their legs…  By and large, the new score by Marc Shaiman errs to a traditionally classic sound, Nick Skilbeck’s orchestra sounding excellent, and time will tell if the tunefulness possess longevity (I can’t say I was humming any of the new songs as I left). The child performers all gave an impressively high level of performance (nice to see Adrianna Bertola again) and there’s good work from Nigel Planer as a sprightly Grandpa Joe (though the other grandparents could do with being defined a little stronger). "
1542,1542,Ought To Be Clowns,05/09/2014,Ian,Little Revolution, Almeida,"The personal connections that one can easily build up in a city such as London are so wide-ranging that the riots of 2011 would most likely have affected us all in some particular way or other. For me, as a former resident of Hackney Downs, it was the sight of an innocuous convenience store being looted that really got me, it was a shop I’d passed every day from which I’d picked up many a bottle of Diet Coke or a lottery ticket and to see it being gutted felt very much not in tune with what Mark Duggan’s death should have stood for. So I was fascinated to see that Alecky Blythe’s new play Little Revolution was focusing on this very shop and the community action that arose from its ransacking. Though 2011’s London Road saw her break through to mainstream success, Blythe has long been a proponent of verbatim theatre, by which she records interviews with real people at the heart of a certain issue and constructs a play out of their exact words – accents, inflections, verbal tics and all. So what we, er, get is a sort of, kind of, flow of the natural rhythm of human speech you know, dialogue that reflects the way we actually speak. I think, well I mean, um…I haven’t really seen enough of verbatim theatre, because that’s what they call it, to really have a, you know, opinion on whether I truly like it as a style or not. But I will say this, I say I will say this, as oddly alienating as it may initially seem (the actors are fed the dialogue through earpieces so they can mirror it exactly), one becomes accustomed to it very quickly and can easily forget it’s even a part of the show. As for the play itself, it’s an intriguing take on the riots which focuses away from the rioters themselves to concentrate instead on the communities around them. A thoroughly middle class group of local residents who start a campaign to raise money for the shopkeeper Siva are contrasted with the more working class women who are spearheading a movement to support Hackney’s disaffected youth and in the middle of it all is a playwright called Alecky who is recording it all – the potentially meta-application of Blythe playing herself is hinted at in the opening but is left as an accepted fact in the end. And she nails so much truth about the uneasy faultlines of a community where rich and poor, black and white rub up without ever really getting each other. The tricky balance between liberal do-goodism and genuinely community-minded good intentions (a line she acknowledges she has to tread herself) is explored, as is the close-mindedness of so many people to the root causes of so much of the violence, an unwillingness to really deal with the key problems but rather just push them away from the doorstep so they don’t inconvenience us. Joe Hill-Gibbins has reconceived the Almeida into a community centre in the round complete with chipboard walls and plastic chairs, but the real coup in Ian MacNeil’s design is the exposure of the giant doors into the foyer. From here, a large community chorus brims with fierce vitality and explosive energy as they burst periodically into the theatre itself and create the (often unseen) noises of young people carousing. That we’re never quite not sure whether they’re in the middle of looting and rioting or simply partying at a local do mirrors the ambivalence towards young’uns and our tendency to direct blame towards them regardless."
1543,1543,Ought To Be Clowns,21/01/2013,Ian,Uncle Vanya, Vaudeville,"Revivals of classics often find themselves caught between two schools: revitalising an oft-performed play with a fresh energy, but remaining aware of not rocking the boat too much in order to maintain a healthy (West End in this case) audience. The Print Room – a venue perhaps less burdened by quite the same commercial concerns as West End houses – were able to go whole-heartedly for the former with a scorchingly good version of Uncle Vanya which paid huge dividends. And Lindsay Posner has definitely gone for the latter option with a stolidly traditional production at the Vaudeville Theatre which does the job but rarely excited me in a similar way. It is undoubtedly well acted, very much so in some quarters, but the performances are overpowered by the stultifying pace of a production that never really got out of second gear. The demonstration of how boring country life can be should never relate to the play itself but Posner has taken Chekhov too literally here and so far too little of the emotional energy being expended by the actors is allowed to take flight on the stage. Instead, the dominant aspect becomes Christopher Oram’s design and the interminably long pauses it enforces during lengthy scene changes which hardly feel worth the effort in the final analysis. It’s a real shame as Samuel West’s Astrov, blessed with foresight as far as environmental issues are concerned but blinkered to the niceties of human interaction, is compelling in his deep tragedy as Laura Carmichael’s Sonya sits patiently, doomed to love unrequitedly from the sidelines. And Anna Friel brings an unexpected depth to Yelena, married off to Paul Freeman’s cantankerous much-older Serebryakov and fending off the attentions of Ken Stott’s titular Vanya. "
1544,1544,Ought To Be Clowns,22/12/2016,mag9l,Art, Old Vic," As someone who considers themselves otherwise rather culturally inclined, I always feel a bit sheepish admitting that I don’t much care for art. Going around a gallery with other people all around and pretending to know what is good about this painting or that is just not my bag, although I did spend an enjoyable couple of hours at the Rijksmuseum last week, on my own and with their app providing commentary on a recommended tour of the highlights, so perhaps there’s hope for me yet. Which is all a prelude to saying that the idea of Yasmin Reza’s Art never appealed to me during its previous stays in the West End, and that even tripping along to the Old Vic for this new revival marking the twentieth anniversary of the play was something of a reluctant stretch. But go I did, to see Matthew Warchus resurrect his original production in the theatre where he is now artistic director, reuniting his creative team with a new cast of Rufus Sewell, Paul Ritter and Tim Key. It’s tough to go into a show like Art with no preconceptions and whilst sometimes when I go in with low expectations, I end up being pleasantly surprised, this was not one of those occasions. A fellow blogger described it beforehand as French people arguing and he wasn’t wrong, with the added je ne sais quoi of it being upper-middle-aged white men talking about their upper-middle-class white men problems for 90 minutes, without an interval, to little substantive effect. For me."
1545,1545,Ought To Be Clowns,11/11/2012,Ian,A Winter’s Tale, Landor,"The first act is just glorious. This Sicilia is a dark, military world and this is obvious from the off with a magnificent multi-layered opener of goose-pimpling intensity which sets the scene perfectly. Pete Gallagher’s Leontes and Alastair Brookshaw’s visiting Polixines make a fine pair of kings, all good-natured joshing until Helen Power’s Ekaterina enters the scene to persuade Polixines to extend his visit whereupon the red mist of vicious jealousy descends on Leontes with devastating consequences for all concerned. Goodall’s swirling melodies and impassioned lyrics are ideally suited to this emotional whirlpool and all three leads excel, backed up by a large but impressive ensemble who bear witness to the tragic consequences of Leontes’ blinkered viewpoint. I found the second act a little more difficult though. The shift to the pastoral scenes of Bohemia, Polixines’ kingdom, is a challenge that every production of The Winter’s Tale has to face and this one lost something for me in the journey there (although not in Martin Thomas’ clever design which achieves a lot with great subtlety). Part of it comes from Stimson’s book which does little to initially establish Perdita and Florizel but it was also partly down to Goodall’s music taking a strange turn to the bland which meant Abigail Matthews and Fra Fee were largely fighting a losing battle in making me care about their relationship. Matters are not helped by retaining the character of Autolycus, here renamed Rob and played by a roguish Ciaran Joyce, who serves mainly as comic relief in delivering some of Goodall’s more whimsical numbers including an ode to lamb (as opposed to pasta…), time that could be spent developing the more central characters. There are a handful of strong tunes here though too, a lovely female duet and the stirring number led by Perdita as she pleads to Polixines to be reasonable makes the Bohemian scenes better as the show progresses. And fortunately the play returns to Sicilia before the end, making for a stronger finale of reunions, reconciliations and repentance to the more persuasive tune of this melancholy court. Helena Blackman shows off an impressive maturity as Paulina, her presence a steadying anchor for all around her even in the midst of another oddly comic song, and the production draws together its strands most effectively. Stimson’s recutting of the dynamic at the end is an interesting choice and one that director Andrew Keates could probably afford to push a little further in the final image of the show to sound a clearer emotional note."
1546,1546,Ought To Be Clowns,25/05/2016,mag9l,Flowers for Mrs Harris, Crucible,"Sheffield feels the right place for Flowers for Mrs Harris to come into bloom, its delicately understated charm and musicality making this a world away from the brash, cut-throat commercialism of West End musicals. That’s not to say I wouldn’t love to see this show come down to the capital, for it does deserve such wider attention, but rather to celebrate the creation and nurturing of musical theatre from all parts of the country, a recognition of a theatrical ecology that thrives far beyond the M25. Daniel Evans’ artistic directorship of Sheffield Theatres, which ends with this production, has been a key part of that over the last few years and it is pleasing to see that his presence in the overall picture will continue as he departs for Chichester Festival Theatre. As for now, we get a gorgeous piece of unmistakably British musical theatre that is as heart-warming and tear-jerking as they come, a tenderly sentimental exploration of far-fetched dreams and earthily real friendships. Based on a 1958 novella by Paul Gallico, Rachel Wagstaff’s book and Richard Taylor’s music and lyrics tell the almost mythical tale of Mrs Ada Harris, a widowed London charlady in her 50s, whose life has been dedicated to the service of others. One day, she espies a Christian Dior dress in the closet of a client and decides that she would like to own one for herself, setting about the gargantuan task of scrimping and saving until she can, incredibly, make her dream come true. And as we move from London to Paris, her generosity of heart continues to inspire those around her.  It’s beautifully, gorgeously, done. Clare Burt soars with an almost magical sense of dignified wonder, her Mrs Harris improving the lives of so many of those who come into contact with her in the cleverly constructed extravagance of Lez Brotherston’s set (though it was a neat kitchen cupboard that caught my eye). She’s supported by a stunning supporting cast who switch roles post-interval – Nicola Sloane’s dressmaker brimming with pride at being acknowledged, Laura Pitt-Pulford’s snooty actress, Mark Meadows as both the departed Mr Harris and a twinkle-eyed marquis, everyone just shines with loveliness. They’re helped by an interesting score from Taylor that eschews brassy showtunes for a more melodious conversational style, which draws the listener into the set-up of the (slightly too long) first act through to the glorious celebration of the second. And you’re struck by just how clever Evans has been here in this final programming choice, echoing the transformative power of musical theatre classics like My Fair Lady and Me and My Girl in a story that truly celebrates the beauty in the ordinary. "
1547,1547,Ought To Be Clowns,01/11/2018,Ian,ear for eye, Royal Court,"debbie tucker green’s new play play ear for eye is ferocious and uncompromising and challenging and quite often breath-taking. Tackling the current state of racism in both the UK and the US, a triptych of wildly diverse parts bind together green’s innate linguistic power with an acutely pointed experiential style and a determination to really make you listen. Played at two hours without an interval, green thus presents us with what it is to be black today. The first is a tangle of overlapping voices, mothers advising sons how to deal with contact with the police, victim of harassment, activists looking to galvanise the struggle. Scenes are repeated in different voices, viscerally contrasting those experiences (particularly when the hand gestures scene is replayed with BSL).  Then we switch to a tightly wound duologue (Lashana Lynch and Demetri Goritsas, both excellent) as a black student talks, discusses, argues with a white professor about the violence meted out by white men in school shooting and bombings etc. She’s adamant it is indicative of systemic, structural racism, he’s sure they’re all lone wolves, but the power dynamics here are astonishing as we’re swept right into the maelstrom of mansplaining mendacity as he battles to exert his authority. Finally, the third section is a filmed segment, white people reciting the horrific detail of some of the Jim Crow laws, seemingly the basis for segregation in the US. And lest we British get too complacent, it is followed by extracts from UK slave codes, tracing the historic links of these pernicious rules, literally codified into society and seemingly impossible to shake off. It is hard to take and that is pretty much green’s point (and why there’s no interval to slope off shamefully).  "
1548,1548,Ought To Be Clowns,20/08/2012,Ian,Hysteria, Richmond Theatre,"Terry Johnson’s 1993 play Hysteria garnered all sorts of awards for its original run at the Royal Court and this revival, from the Theatre Royal Bath, features Antony Sher in its leading role, so it is clearly a play that is held in some considerable regard. Set in the leafy Hampstead refuge where Sigmund Freud has sequestered himself as he battles cancer, his seclusion is interrupted by a series of visitors. Jessica, a mysterious young woman arrives, determined to have some of his time and seeking attention by stripping off her clothes, the subsequent arrivals of his elderly doctor Yahuda and then Salvador Dalí – Johnson was inspired by a real life meeting between the pair – leads to much slapstick comedy as Freud tries to hide the naked Jessica. But the real reasons for their visits are more serious and the play evolves into something much more complex.  Structurally though, it poses challenges as the mix of high-concept verbosity and low-rent humour is not always a comfortable one. Jessica’s presence, which sparks off the chain of farcical shenanigans – which, if you find the sight of a man in his underpants generally hilarious, you might like –subsequently becomes the vehicle for the playwright’s delving into the much more cerebral. The ethics of psychotherapy are interrogated as Freud’s own case histories come under the microscope, matters of Jewish identity explored as the Blitz rains down outside and the spectre of the Holocaust looms ever large, but the farce still remains, an uneasy bedfellow in the superstructure of the play. The comedy never advances the action, in fact the reverse is true: the play essentially stops to let these scenes play out, resulting in a first half which is close to 90 minutes. They never feel like a fully incorporated part of the writing."
1549,1549,Ought To Be Clowns,16/02/2020,Ian,The Visit or The Old Lady Comes to Call, National Theatre,"There’s no two ways about it – Tony Kushner’s new version of Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s 1956 The Visit or The Old Lady Comes to Call is a punishing evening on the buttocks. Thank the Lord (or the donors) for the relative comfort of the seating at the National Theatre but unless you’re a fan of Lesley Manville (and what right-thinking individual isn’t), it could well prove punishing on your patience too.  Manville really is superb. She’s Claire Zachanassian, the richest woman in the world who has returned to her dilapidated hometown with an intriguing proposition for the townsfolk. She’ll donate an incredible, life-changing amount of money for everyone if they’ll carry out a brutal act of vengeance on the man whose actions forced her to leave the place as a pregnant teenager. And she rises to the challenge, displaying a mesmerising stage presence that is startling in its power.  But there’s just so much stuff around her, well over three hours of it, and without Manville’s Claire at the heart of the action, you begin to feel closer to every minute of it. Kushner clearly doesn’t believe in the concept of a tight edit and as amusing florid as much of his language gets, in these quantities it’s just too much, it’s anti-consumerist message a sledgehammer trying to keep us awake with every bash."
1550,1550,Ought To Be Clowns,17/02/2010,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Rose Theatre Kingston,"She’s back!! I’m referring of course to Aunty Jean who popped down for the evening for some dinner and a little theatrical amusement. The play in question was A Midsummer Night’s Dream featuring a reunited Peter Hall directing and Judi Dench as Titania, 40 years on since their last collaboration in these two roles. “The wisest aunt” casually regaled me with her (not sad) tales of seeing Peter Hall’s redefining production of this self-same play and McKellen and Dench in Macbeth as we sipped some vile pinot grigio at the Rose Theatre in Kingston, anticipating the treats in store and giggling at the warning of the use of ‘haze’ in the performance. The conceit is that Dench is actually playing Elizabeth I, as she does in a brief wordless prologue where she opens a performance of a play, who then materialises as Titania in the same dress. It’s an interesting take which works almost entirely due to the warmth radiating from her performance. The scenes when she is bewitched are just delightful, her coos and chuckles with her paramour display all the ecstasy of a lust-fuelled passion simply through the strength of her verse-reading. She also displays some considerable stamina: at one point laying slumbering with her neck in a most awkward position for such a long time, and let us not forget she is 75 now, that I did worry for her joints: I don’t think I could have stayed that still for that long, at least without falling asleep!  But much like the recent RSC Twelfth Night, despite all the publicity, this isn’t a star vehicle, it is an ensemble piece and it is much to Judi Dench’s credit that her stellar turn complements and is complemented by the performances around her. Indeed it is Rachael Stirling who emerges as the star of this production, as Helena she proves just why she recently received a Olivier nomination, speaking with impassioned drama and a great warmth. She also gives a masterclass in reactive acting during the lovers’ quarrels and particularly whilst watching the rude mechanicals: a stunning performance and a true talent. The other lovers are good: Annabel Scholey’s Hermia is perky and Tam Williams and Ben Mansfield interact very well as the duelling Lysander and Demetrius, especially given that these are not particularly well-drawn characters. Elsewhere, Oliver Chris’ Bottom is brilliant, his swagger with the ass’s head at the end of the first act brought the house down and along with Leon Williams’ Flute plays possibly the funniest Pyramus and Thisbe death scene I’ve ever seen. The set by Elizabeth Bury initially looks a bit bleakly modern but as we enter the forest, it is enhanced to gorgeous effect by Peter Mumford’s lighting and a shadowy arboreal world is created which fitted the mood carefully. This is by no means a perfect production. Reece Ritchie’s frantic Puck is often too focused on the physical manifestation of his impishness to deliver his lines clearly enough, he just needs to slow down a bit. And whilst Charles Edwards’ dashing Oberon was excellent, his rueful regret at the way his follies have played out being particularly moving, one couldn’t help but wonder why they didn’t cast someone who looked a bit older to partner Dench. (Maybe this was meant to reflect Elizabeth’s penchant for surrounding herself with younger men?) In the end though, this is as classy as English theatre gets. A comfortable, familiar treat, there’s nothing controversial here nor should there be. A traditional, Elizabethan production in which the focus is squarely on good acting and strong verse-reading and a welcome opportunity to witness a truly great actress with absolute mastery of her craft. Couldn't agree more: a true focus on the text and how it was spoken. Just a shame Puck hadn't paid the same attention as the others. Glad you enjoyed it too. I do wonder how many people will trek over to Kingston to see it though, it was a very painfully long journey ome for me on a cold, wet night. I think the main problem with Puck is that he has so many well-known lines that it is almost a crime to not deliver them properly: I barely heard the ""girdle round about the earth"" line at all. The ushers are all volunteers!! The mobile phone thing happened to me as well – as I was switching mine off.  It really didn't make me feel welcome."
1551,1551,Ought To Be Clowns,16/04/2017,Ian,Miss Nightingale – the musical, Vaults,"It’s fascinating to be able to revisit shows along their developmental cycle. I first saw Miss Nightingale in its initial chamber-musical incarnation at the King’s Head back in 2011 and since then, it has become a fully-fledged piece which has toured the UK extensively. This residency at the Vaults marks the show’s fifth production and the first time I’ve been able to revisit and reassess Matthew Bugg’s actor-musician musical. Set in London in 1942, it relays two parallel and interconnected narratives – the metamorphosis of nurse Maggie Brown to fresh new cabaret star Miss Nightingale, and the illicit gay love affair between her Polish-Jewish émigré songwriter and the upper-class war hero-turned-nightclub-impresario who is behind their rise. As bombs continue to fall on London, contemporary attitudes toward homosexuality threaten to cause no less potent explosions.
The cabaret setting allows for Bugg to stretch his songwriting muscle with a range of bawdy numbers – ‘Suasage Song’, ‘Let Me Play On Your Pipe’, ‘The Pussy Song’ – which are delivered with the requisite glint in the eye from Tamar Broadbent. And his book songs also have a beautifully yearning sense of romance (‘Mister Nightingale’) and tenderness (‘Understudy’) about them, which makes it a most enjoyable show to listen to. Dramatically, it doesn’t always quite carry the same charge. Conor O’Kane’s nerdish but passionate George and Nicholas Coutu-Langmead’s starched but softening Frank connects well in their scenes, this is a show unafraid to be romantic instead of raunchy. But splitting the focus of the show between them and Miss Nightingale herself reduces its impact, particularly as Broadbent struggles to flesh out her character meaningfully in her straight scenes."
1552,1552,Ought To Be Clowns,16/01/2011,Ian,Twelfth Night, National Theatre,"To celebrate his 80th birthday, Sir Peter Hall returns to the National Theatre which he directed for 25 years, with a production of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night at the Cottesloe. It features a rather starry cast including his daughter Rebecca Hall and Simon Callow and given how well done last year’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Kingston was, this has been an eagerly anticipated production for me for a fair few months. This is a review of a preview, the penultimate one as it opens on Tuesday, but still a preview nonetheless though I stand by my comments here. This is just a production that is lacking, lacking in almost every department and there isn’t even a particular aspect that shines above the others that one could excuse weakness elsewhere for. It feels proficient rather than inspired and though performances may improve and the pacing can be tightened up, the whole approach to this production is unspectacular. Worse than that, it is often boring and the first half in particular is currently far too languid and dull as attested by a fair few walk-outs at the interval. Played in traditional dress (which put me in mind of The Three Musketeers more often than not) and keeping the wig department extremely busy, all the men wear their hair long which is fine in itself, but when Viola’s transformation is thus effected simply by putting on an outfit (Hall’s hair is then allowed to remain loose), it was just the first of many underwhelming moments in this tale of unrequited love and mistaken identities. Rebecca Hall brings a tender subtlety to her beautifully spoken performance which works in some respects but not others: her quietly bemused Cesario garnered many a chuckle when commenting on the madness going on around him, but this also results in a kind of reservedness to her portrayal. There’s not quite the requisite zest, to truly convince as both the object and subject of unrequited love, but I feel this is a general malaise of the production and specifically with her co-stars. Marton Csokas’ Orsino feels badly misjudged, listless and lethargic throughout, showing no real charm and bringing no life to Shakespeare’s words, indeed he brought little volume to them either at times. And Amanda Drew as Olivia is strangely subdued, even after she breaks free from her mourning dress into a dodgy bright orange number there’s no real spark, no charge to her pursuit of Cesario. Her verse speaking is lovely, but it was hard not to be underwhelmed knowing how good an actress she is. Elsewhere, Ben Mansfield as Sebastian, David Ryall’s Feste, even Simon Paisley Day’s Malvolio were all fine, but competent rather than revelatory, no-one really catches fire which is a real shame in this particular play which is so ensemble heavy. The only real energy came from the comic strand with Charles Edwards’ golden Labrador of an Andrew Aguecheek being an absolute delight and Finty Williams’ Maria really making the most of what is quite a small role with an effervescence that was just lacking elsewhere. Simon Callow’s Toby Belch is also strong, played exactly how one would expect Callow to play it but he has such a natural ease with the verse that is allowed to freely flow here with these characters that makes these scenes the highlight of the show, Samuel James’ Fabian being an additional little bright light. Opening the second half with Malvolio’s discovery of the letter is a wise choice given the energy they bring. The playing space has been opened up quite considerably, as big as I’ve ever seen a traditional end-on stage in the Cottesloe, but it isn’t then utilised to its best advantage. Anthony Ward’s design is non-specific and rather bland, bleached brick rear wall and pale timber floorboards, a terribly naff set of toy houses and a canopy which is occasionally lowered to create a sense of change in location but more often than not is just hanging from above, casting a huge shadow on the stage. There’s something almost perverse in the creation of so much space and yet frequently having characters speak on their own, Peter Mumford’s lighting does little to hide the vast expanse of empty space and despite having brought in a live band, there is very little music used throughout. As for the final song with its exhortations for the audience to join in the chorus of ‘Hey nonny no’, I simply cringed. The word that springs to mind when thinking about this production is, unfortunately, mediocre: it just brings nothing new or refreshing to this oft-performed play. One doesn’t go to a Peter Hall production expecting great innovation but one does expect a classic interpretation, alive to the very nature of the play. But in underplaying and in some cases denying the sexiness, the humour, the darkness, the musicality of Twelfth Night, he has reduced this play to an unthreatening, criminally dull three hours: utterly underwhelming. (NB: The highlight of the evening for me was discovering the joys of row T at the Cottesloe. Sold as restricted view for £10, our seats offered an unhampered view from the centre of the back row and given how small the theatre is and how far forward the stage comes in this production, they were excellent value.) I must have been at a different performance. I thought it was stunning. The weaknesses perceived in this review could equally be seen as some of the production's strengths: e.g. empty spaces and unfussy staging allowed our focus to remain on the text; individual performances that might have seemed underwhelming might have helped to create ensemble coherence, rather than individual glory; Orsino is not a very profound character in the first place (compared to Viola/Cesario) so there is arguably little point in trying to make him sound like he is;  and Viola's literal and physical ""transformation"" is for me one of the least important dramatic things about bringing this masterful work to life. I thought there were some lovely moments: e.g. Feste's silent brooding, whilst the anti-Malvolio plan was gleefully being hatched by the others… a masterful bit of direction / acting, and very thought-provoking. I'm with the author here, mediocre is exactly what we thought and so we left at the interval. It looked ugly, that slow-moving canopy was ridiculous, we felt no energy coming from the cast and your attempts to defend Csokas' Orsino is laughable, he's shit because the character is shit is no argument at all. no 2: are you parsley by any chance? hello no. 2, I didn't say the character is ""shit"", any more than I said that I thought the actor was ""shit"". I said you could justify making Viola more profound than Orsino, given the text. Forgive me for speculating, when readers like you know it all! You seem rather angry and willing to assume the very worst about (a) the director's and actors' efforts and (b) my motivations. But why bother going to the theatre in the first place to discover how others interpret a piece, if you know best? i've heard that there is a lost Shakespeare play happening not far from the NT over in Southwark about to start, is this something that you'll be reviewing? any idea where i can find the production details? It is nice to see alternative opinions to shows I've seen, especially when they are as well-reasoned and thoughful as yours (#1 that is!) I think we will just have to agree to disagree though, especially with Csokas' Orsino, but that is the beauty of opinions, we can all have our own. And I am glad that you enjoyed it so much. I shall indeed be reviewing Double Falsehood at the weekend. It is on at the Union Theatre http://www.uniontheatre.biz looks like it should be interesting though I need to read up on it a bit first, not 100% sure of the history behind it, how it relates to Cardenio and the issues with the accreditation to Shakespeare. Watch this space!"
1553,1553,Ought To Be Clowns,14/03/2012,Ian,Sweeney Todd, Adelphi,"Last year was undoubtedly a great one for Chichester Festival Theatre’s musicals – Singin’ in the Rain and Sweeney Todd both figured very highly in end of year lists and both were granted West End transfers after their sell-out runs. But there’s always a danger in revisiting shows one has loved, there’s no guarantee that the magic will be recaptured again especially in larger theatres. So I’ve currently avoided going back to Singin’ in the Rain in its new home in the Palace (though never say never) and hadn’t thought I’d go back to Sweeney Todd which has just started previews at the Adelphi. But when kindly offered a ticket, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to return to the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. My original review can be read here and in many ways, much of what I said still stands. It’s a highly atmospheric, effective production of Sondheim’s classic revenge tale which lives on its luxury lead casting in a transformed Michael Ball as the titular Todd and an incandescent Imelda Staunton as Mrs Lovett. Staunton truly is epic here, thoroughly attuned to the comedy especially in the one-upmanship of ‘A Little Priest’ but also movingly desperate as her inclinations remain unfulfilled and she is possibly better here than in Chichester. Michael Ball didn’t quite live up to the memory of his performance, missing some of the necessary malevolence, though he still sings the part well. But my overall feeling was one of a little disappointment. A part of it can be attributed to the whole ‘never as good as the first time’ thing which there’s no point denying, but I did find there to be issues with the production in its transfer as well. From the moment we first saw Anthony Ward’s set design, it was clear that it had a proscenium arch theatre in mind – the curved metal garret fits in perfectly into the Adelphi but it paid little mind to the large number of audience members on the sides at Chichester. But even here, it still didn’t feel quite right. The vast expanse of the stage is often very sparsely populated despite the considerable ensemble and more often than not, things are happening at the back of the stage, which combined with the hugeness of the theatre (the Dress Circle goes back to Row O) has a considerable distancing effect and the feeling that things are being missed. The height of the set also means that the back rows of each level are actually restricted view, though not sold as such, which undeniably adds to the estrangement. Matters are not helped by a first act which does take a very long time to get going, I’d be tempted to trim it by about 15 minutes myself, and which too often doesn’t utilise the potential offered by the ensemble. I remain unconvinced by the Anthony and Joanna storyline which not helped by still being anaemically played here, Lucy May Barker still failing to register any sense of character at all. And the train whistle of doom that sounds at random intervals began to really annoy me, as I found myself failing to really engage with the show. But though I ended up on something of a downer, I would still recommend Sweeney Todd in all honesty. It is always a pleasure to see musicals that stretch the public perception of the form in West End houses, so many of the most interesting musicals have been in fringe theatres where new audiences won’t always come across them. And the dark moodiness here combined with Imelda Staunton in the form of her life should make this a hot ticket for the months to come. (Just make sure you do as much research as possible into the sightlines from your seat.)"
1554,1554,Ought To Be Clowns,26/09/2008,Ian,Ivanov, Wyndhams,"The key to my enjoyment here was all about the humour that is threaded throughout the evening so that the dour tragedy that is something of a trademark is leavened with something else and introduces a wider palette of emotion so that the ‘tragedy’ becomes well, more tragic for being contrasted with something else on offer. So Ivanov, seeking escape from his TB-ridden wife whom he no longer loves, rocks up at the neighbours’ house on a regular basis despite owing them money and a daughter there who has designs on him. When discovered together, society turns it disapproving eye on him but it turns out there’s a far harsher critic in Ivanov himself. Branagh is simply superb as the title character, capturing so much of the ridiculousness of what he is like and what is going on but also acknowledging how serious the predicament is. The ensemble around Branagh is stuffed full of brilliantly observed performances: Gina McKee is heartbreaking as Anna, the woman who has sacrificed huge amounts to be with the man she loves despite his shortcomings, Andrea Riseborough’s Sasha traces a highly affecting journey from innocence to a much more worldly-wise viewpoint and there’s an excellent company of maudlin drunks and odd sorts played by the likes of Malcolm Sinclair, Kevin R McNally and Lorcan Cranitch."
1555,1555,Ought To Be Clowns,10/09/2015,mag9l,Matilda the Musical, Cambridge Theatre,"Despite naming it my show of the year in 2011 (or maybe because of that), I’ve not been back to see Matilda the Musical since it opened at the Cambridge Theatre four years ago. I had such the perfect emotional journey with the show that I just didn’t want to alter that experience by going back and risking it being something of a disappointment, especially with such impossibly high standards to live up to from that amazing original cast and Bertie Carvel’s iconic Mrs Trunchbull. Four years is long enough though I think, and when the opportunity to revisit the show presented itself, I accepted the offer with just a little trepidation. Those nerves were quickly dispelled, even as soon as entering the theatre to witness the infectious enthusiasm of an audience of all ages, and the reassuring sight of Rob Howell’s design with its multi-coloured letters strewn across the set. And as Laurie Perkins’ orchestra launched into the familiar strains of ‘Miracle’, my heart leapt and I wondered how I had left it this long. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I loved the show just as much all over again with goosebump moments hitting me from start to finish. I still maintain that the staging of ‘When I Grow Up’ is one of the best things I’ve ever seen in a theatre and it made me cry with such happiness I was glad for the darkened auditorium. The vibrancy of Peter Darling’s choreography remains an absolute delight too, the mixture of actual children and adults dressed as children a thrilling combination throughout. And even with a completely different cast, Matthew Warchus’ production still works wonders with Roald Dahl’s characters. Children’s Casting Director Jessica Ronane and her team have to be commended for their continued amazing efforts at unearthing such young talent – Lara McDonnell’s performance is deeply impressive for its willingness to show us as much of the little girl Matilda is as well as the extraordinary heroine and Remi Gooding is irrepressibly good fun as the recalcitrant Bruce."
1556,1556,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2019,Ian,Tobacco Road, VAULT Festival,"While we wait for the inevitable offical theatrical adaptation of Peaky Blinders, an unofficial one emerges in the form of Tobacco Road. Incognito Theatre’s play, directed by Roberta Zuric, has an impressive visual flair to it (choreography by Zak Nemorin) and is undoubtedly inventively staged, it just lacks originality. Delving into life as a gangster in the immediate aftermath of the Great War, the play pulls out theme after theme in an attempt to give voice to the kind of stories that don’t get enough airtime. But as another and then another is pulled out of the hat – it’s hard to be a woman, it’s hard to be a gay, it’s hard to be a drug addict – too little get the attention they deserve."
1557,1557,Ought To Be Clowns,09/09/2019,Ian,Torch Song Trilogy, Turbine Theatre,"I remain unconvinced that what London wants, needs or is ready for is yet another new theatre but regardless, the Turbine Theatre is here, lurking under the arches in the shadow of Battersea Power Station like a cross between the Menier Chocolate Factory and the Union Theatre. Its opening salvo is a production of Harvey Fierstein’s Torch Song Trilogy, directed by Drew McOnie in his straight play debut and in terms of appealing to – indeed finding – a new core audience (in lieu of the community of people who will actually live in this new development, heading for the gays makes for a wise choice.   A seminal classic from the 1980s gay theatre canon, this version is edited down from the 4+ hours of the original, as it follows the life of Jewish drag queen Arnold Beckoff as he navigates the late 70s and early 80s with their hints of social change for the lives of gay men in New York City.  And that it does relatively effectively. Matthew Needham is in fine form as Arnold, all forlorn flourish in his deep-rooted sadness. And as he moves from lovers to coupledom to [spoiler] parenthood, the world of Arnold’s family is richly depicted, Dino Fetscher as bisexual lover Ed and Jay Lycurgo as the young David both shine. "
1558,1558,Ought To Be Clowns,03/02/2014,Ian,The Domino Heart, Finborough,"‘Piece of my Heart’ Cara’s husband has been killed in a car crash and she is wracked with guilt for arguing with him just beforehand. Mortimer is a Reverend in his 70s whose fear of death is matched only by his fear of not having lived (and loved). And Leo is a brash corporate type whose only real pleasure comes from making money with the rest of life a pointless distraction to him. But as he takes his shirt off, we see that he has received a heart transplant and not only that, it is a domino heart, one which has been already rejected by a recipient and therefore has carried on down the chain.  ‘Don’t Go Breaking My Heart’ Edison uses monologue almost exclusively to really ram home this theme of isolation, something that results from the choices we make in their self-destructiveness. So Amanda Hale’s urgently compelling Cara takes the blame fully on herself for her husband’s death, anguish tearing her apart in a deeply moving performance. Lawrence Werber’s Mort is still haunted by the missed opportunity for romance in his younger years, a bluff geniality not quite hiding his pain. And Rob Cavazos’ Leo prowls urgently around his room, increasingly bitter at the world that spat him out, spitting back in its face when he can. ‘Anyone Who Has A Heart’ The format precludes the kind of inter-relation between the characters that one thinks might emerge and it is a bold choice that plays up the more wrenching aspects of the human experience even as the light at the end of the tunnel finally does appear towards the end. Director Jane Jeffery does allow barely visible spiderweb connections to be drawn though, echoes of thought and movement providing spine-tingling moments in amongst the fiercely intense acting. Cavazos’ bracing physicality is impossible to drag one’s eyes from but Hale (such a boon to see her in a modern piece for once) is just exceptional here, a real tour-de-force."
1559,1559,Ought To Be Clowns,07/10/2013,Ian,Ghosts, Almeida,"Like the dose of the clap on which it is centred, productions of Ibsen’s Ghosts appear with alarming regularity – indeed Stephen Unwin premiered his own new version for the Rose Kingston and English Touring Theatre just a couple of weeks ago – and for someone who has largely remained immune to Ibsen’s charms, the claims that this is one of the dramatic pinnacles of the theatrical canon have always bemused me somewhat. Unwin’s detailed period production laboured heavily under its respectful approach that ended up almost dull in its restraint but Richard Eyre’s interpretation, which he has adapted and directed himself for the Almeida, is fresh and raw and as appallingly exciting as this play could ever hope to be. Lesley Manville has rarely been better than as Helene Alving here, a woman caught up in the cocoon of protective lies she has told to protect her son from the knowledge that his father was a philandering ne’er-do-well who carried the pox, to protect her family’s reputation from the moralistic gaze of a fiercely hypocritical society, to protect herself from the inherent misery of the life that society has deemed appropriate for her. The minute that cocoon starts to unravel, so too does Manville, coils of hair break free from her coiffure and tightly bottled emotions start to spill forth. It’s a freedom of sorts with an exhilarating compulsive energy but it spirals out of her control, as she realises she can’t escape anything from the past, it is utterly heartbreaking. As she reaches for the arms of Will Keen’s excellent churchman, though his sanctimonious posturing is a huge part of the problem, the implacable rejection is the starting pistol for her descent. Keen unearths an effective comic side to Pastor Manders which counters his evangelical zeal excellently. Helene also ends up riding roughshod over Charlene McKenna’s Regina, the maid who discovers too late that her amorous intentions, and her ticket out of Dødge, are doomed – Manville turning her own baleful stare on the younger woman. For the centre of everything, rotten as it may be, is her relationship with her son, Jack Lowden’s ailing Oswald. He makes his fast-developing degeneration painfully convincing, forcing the deepest of confessions from his mother and offering up a truly upsetting climax – brilliant, brutal work from both Manville and Lowden. "
1560,1560,Ought To Be Clowns,24/08/2013,Ian,A Season in the Congo, Young Vic,"The curse of theatre addiction is that even when I know I don’t want to see something, I quite often end up going anyway, especially when it has been well recommended by friends and colleagues. So it was with the Young Vic’s A Season in the Congo, particularly galling as someone very kind indeed offered to queue for dayseats… Joe Wright’s theatrical debut as a director came earlier this year with Trelawny of the Wells at the Donmar, a production I wasn’t much enamoured with, but he kicks into another gear altogether with this 1966 play by Aimé Césaire about the life and death of Patrice Lumumba, one of the men who led the Democratic Republic of Congo to independence. It’s a vastly collaborative work, pulling together wide-ranging artistic elements into a hugely theatrical experience which is hugely ambitious and was clearly well-received, though I found it to be distracting and distancing. Choreographer (and co-director) Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui intersperses numerous dance sequences, musician Kabongo Tshisensa makes a Brechtian troubadour-like figure who passes comment throughout on the action in tribal dialect, puppets and masks are used to represent the white characters and colonial powers whose influences are very much in decline. They’re undoubtedly impressively done yet for me, all over-used, reducing their impact and padding out an already healthy run-time unnecessarily. Chiwetel Ejiofor’s Lumumba is a towering performance at the centre of the play, but one which lacks much nuance as his default mode here is a shouty feverishness, which made him less of a tragic figure than perhaps Césaire intended. In his final moments though, when he is toppled from the prime ministership, there’s a deeply affecting mood that resonates with desperate sadness. As his Brutus-like colleague, Daniel Kaluuya’s Colonel Mobutu has all the requisite glowering menace but again, suffers from a lack of complexity as the tangled world of politics is reduced to an overly simplified narrative."

1563,1563,Ought To Be Clowns,12/04/2016,mag9l,Scenes from 68* Years, Arcola,"The asterisk in the title is important. It denotes the number of years since the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 and so if the play were to be put on again next year, it would be entitled Scenes from 69* Years. It all adds to the sense of living history that permeates Hannah Khalil’s Scenes from 68* Years, a series of snapshots from life in Palestine throughout that time in all its complexity as to build one nation, another must be broken. It’s a deeply emotive subject but one which is approached with clear-eyed balance by Khalil. Her stories, collated from the experiences of friends and family, are presented as non-linear vignettes – a picnic interrupted by soldiers in 1992, a charity worker making an aid run in 2010, a boy playing a prank on his grandfather in 1978 and so on – but the perspectives they offer come from Palestinians and Israelis alike, giving details of how day-to-day life co-exists with headline-grabbing drama. The swirling multiple strands are well-marshalled by director Chris White, delving into a well of the blackest comedy – Peter Polycarpou’s patriarch realising the joke is on him is as punchy and powerful a moment as you’ll see on stage all year. And the playfully makeshift nature of Paul Burgess’ set reinforcing the impermanence of lives being lived on the brink, one soldier away from a rifle butt in the face or even eviction. Palestinian actress Maisa Abd Elhadi Skypes into a selection of scenes but otherwise the cohesiveness of the tightly-knit ensemble is hugely impressive as they flow seamlessly from one character to the next, delineated to a degree but not definitively so. For no matter whether its 1956 or 2016, canned peaches and children’s toys not being allowed through customs still rankles, and contrasting desires to escape the suffocation or return to the embrace of the motherland will always exist. And it is this human dimension that resonates strongest, whether in single scenes like the soldier nervously exploring a fetish or recurring ones, like the conflicting emotions provoked by a Jewish émigré’s soul-satisfying pleasure in being able to find a home in Jerusalem as explained to the young Arab man whose mother was evicted therefrom. "

They’d go on to win Tony Awards for shows like Ragtime but this work definitely has the feel of a writing team still finding their feet. An adaptation of the Michael Butterworth novel The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, this musical farce makes bold claims from its opening number ‘Something Funny’s Going On’ but sometimes you’re left wondering if its funny-haha or just funny-odd. It’s an unevenness that is underlined by MKEC Productions’ approach here at the Drayton Arms, director Marc Kelly reaching ambitiously to give us all the conventions of a farce, as it plays out here in a Monte Carlo hotel but on limited means, failing to conjure much luxury or laughter. Without the knowing wink to acknowledge the naffness, in a manner like Acorn Antiques say, the attention can’t help but be drawn to unwieldy yet wobbly door frames and barely disguised camp beds, which is a shame as this enthusiastic company deserve better."

1567,1567,Ought To Be Clowns,17/11/2014,Ian,God Bless The Child, Royal Court,"As with Vivienne Franzmann and Mogadishu, Molly Davies brings a wealth of teaching experience to her playwriting after many years in the job and in shows in the little details of its characters. The enthusiasm with which Ony Uhiara’s youthful Ms Newsome seizes on new teaching initiative Badger Do Best, the cautious eye on finances that Nikki Amuka-Bird’s head Ms Evitt maintains, the seen-it-all pragmatism of old-school teaching assistant Mrs Bradley, perfectly cast in Julie Hesmondhalgh. And as government-appointed educational Svengali, Amanda Abbington’s Sali Rayner has a chilling evangelical zeal. 
The stars of the show are Class 4N though, the guinea pigs for this new scheme which is as much about behaviour management and conflict resolution than actually helping them to learn. But as they try out such innovations as Thinking Toadstools, Badger Buddies and Listening Lilypads in preparation for an inspection visit from the Department for Education to release the next tranche of funding, a deliciously insubordinate streak kicks in in the form of Nancy Allsop’s Louie who sets about fermenting rebellion amongst her comrades in a remarkably assured performance. Two groups of young actors share the roles of 4N (I saw the Green Team) and in an ingenious twist from director Vicky Featherstone, the alternative group of actors (Orange Team) is headed up by a male Louis which will undoubtedly bring its own fresh dynamic to the play. (It also bafflingly has one fewer character in it, there’s no Aaron in the Orange Team – any clues why gratefully received!). It’s a shame the schedule for the different teams isn’t published as I’d happily go again to see how Bobby Smalldridge’s Louis differs in the role (or not, as the case may be)."
1568,1568,Ought To Be Clowns,06/09/2014,Ian,The Lion, St James Studio,"Less of a theatre show and more of a confessional cabaret, the positive noises growing around Benjamin Scheuer’s The Lion were such that my perennial fear of missing out on something special kicked in and so I grabbed a late cheap deal to see him in the studio space of the St James Theatre in Victoria. And sure enough, it is a perfectly formed gem, a million miles from conventional musical theatre but packing as big a punch as any 11 o’clock number you’ve ever heard. The Lion is an autobiographical tale of love and loss, family and music, maths exams and cancer, employing a suite of songs that he uses six guitars to play and which demonstrate a substantial gift for story-telling as well as song-writing, the narrative throughline that emerges is extraordinary. It’s also deceptively simple – the opening number of ‘Cookie Tin Banjo’ has a child-like glee but also contains the beginnings of a tumultuous relationship between father and son. This folk style, almost country-like, is where Scheuer shines and in tracing the major events of his life – the death of his father, the trials of falling in and out of love, a battle with cancer – it is where the moments of intimate emotional truth really hit home. As with most boys, there’s a rebellious streak in him and with one of the guitars being electric, a rockier edge provides texture to the score, especially during the boarding school years."
1569,1569,Ought To Be Clowns,23/02/2017,mag9l,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Young Vic,"Joe Hill-Gibbins’ idiosyncratic 2015 take on Measure for Measure filled the Young Vic with inflatable sex dolls so it should come as little surprise that for his A Midsummer Night’s Dream, he and designer Johannes Schütz have transformed the stage into a muddy paddock. With just a mirrored back wall to add to the set, the scene is thus set for an exploration of the “subconscious” of this most oft-seen (particularly in the year gone by) of Shakespeare’s plays.  There’s some great work, delving into the murkiness of the relationships here. Far from spirits “of no common rate”, these royal fairies feel like a real married couple in the throes of having to work things out yet again, Michael Gould’s Oberon’s manipulations as much as anguished as angry, and Anastasia Hille’s Titania relishing the removal of the ball and chain as she plays sex games with Bottom, roleplaying the attending fairies in a witty twist. The intensity of their connection repeats itself later in another clever connection.  And casting upwards in age for the lovers complicates them in a fascinating way, especially with their clear shared sexual history here. Anna Madeley thoroughly owns it as a Helena who knows exactly what she is after in claiming back Demetrius, whilst John Dagleish’s Lysander pushes the boundaries of consent as far as he can before acquiescing to “human modesty”. The woods have rarely felt so dark and once the night is done, Jemima Rooper’s Hermia is left near-catatonic by events and Oliver Alvin-Wilson’s Demetrius seems to have been sent mad.  But for all that it is intriguing and interesting, the production rarely struck me as compelling, it seems to bear the hallmarks of devised work a little too plainly. Melanie Pappenheim’s First Fairy is an ethereally conceived being who delivers her lines in a sing-song manner and twitches and flutters most affectedly throughout and on meeting, Lloyd Hutchinson’s Irish Puck mocks her and her acting style disdainfully. His sardonic approach is amusing, but sitting so far at odds from Pappenheim’s interpretation of fairykind, and in turn from how Oberon and Titania are presented, it feels like a disconnect.  So too the use of music. Latin chorales emphasise the ensemble feel (though smack more of rehearsal room exercises) but once Leo Bill’s Bottom is off the leash, he’s singing soft rock classics like Aerosmith and Maria McKee’s ‘Show Me Heaven’, too often this just feels like a world not cohering. That said, the Mechanicals are highly enjoyable; Bill makes for a dramatically different, guileless Bottom than I’ve ever seen before; and for the second night in a row, the opaqueness of some Shakespearean dialogue was roundly mocked, which tickled me pink. But like many a dream, this Dream feels a bit confused and too ephemeral to linger too long in the mind."
1570,1570,Ought To Be Clowns,22/02/2014,mag9l,Finian’s Rainbow, Union Theatre,"wanna laugh like a loon” Suspension of disbelief is par for the course with musical theatre, especially the type of obscure revivals that the Union Theatre specialises in, and Finian’s Rainbow is no exception in that respect. A leprechaun who is slowly turning into a human, a twinkle-eyed Irishman determined to grow a forest of gold, a mute girl who communicates solely through the medium of dance…this is unabashed hokum of the top order, but the sincerity of Phil Willmott’s sterling production makes it a genuine delight. For what it’s worth, the plot concerns the twinkle-eyed Irishman Finian McLonegan’s efforts to make his fortune in the Deep South having borrowed a crock of gold from a leprechaun and marry off his granddaughter Sharon in the process. The community of tobacco pickers where they end up welcome them and their money with open arms but a corrupt and racist senator has other plans for the land on which they toil, putting their future in peril. E.Y. Harburg and Fred Saidy’s book contains much more dry humour than you might expect though, jabs about immigration and bankers showing how little things have changed in many respects. A considerable cast of 23 fill the stage with great enthusiasm and a straight bat – no knowing post-modern approaches here – which forefronts the show’s shining strength, Burton Lane’s music accompanied by Harburg’s lyrics. Such classics as ‘How Are Things in Glocca Morra?’, ‘Old Devil Moon’ and ‘Look To The Rainbow’ are beautifully rendered by Richard Baker’s band, sung gloriously by the company and enhanced by the vibrant choreography of Thomas Michael Voss’ which even gives the older members of the cast a fair crack of the whip."
1571,1571,Ought To Be Clowns,29/08/2016,mag9l,Into the Woods, Menier Chocolate Factory,"Fiasco Theater’s production of Stephen Sondheim’s evergreen Into the Woods was a big success over in the US and its actor-muso ethos seems ideally suited for this transfer to the Menier Chocolate Factory. It’s also an approach that pays dividends with the material, Sondheim and James Lapine’s interrogation of the world of fairy tales and what happy ever after really means. Stripped back and doubled up, Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld’s fully actor-musician production makes a virtue of the communal spirit and really makes you notice how much of an ensemble show it really is. Not just in how each of the storybook characters get their chance to shine (or not, as the case may be) but in the relationships, of both family and friends, with which we surround ourselves, just to save us from those moments in the woods."

1573,1573,Ought To Be Clowns,08/07/2018,Ian,The Jungle, Playhouse,"Following on from an enormously successful run at the Young Vic last year, The Jungle has made the move to the Playhouse Theatre in one of the unlikeliest but most significant West End transfers in recent history. Joe Robertson and Joe Murphy’s play was born out of their experiences in setting up the Good Chance theatre in the Calais refugee camp that gives it its name and accompanied by an extraordinary (re)design of the space by Miriam Buether, becomes a genuinely unforgettable theatrical experience. Buether’s design recreates the Afghan restaurant that was part of the camp where audiences can sit at the table (which becomes a thrust stage) surrounded by the heady scent of warming spices and baking bread. It’s a useful reminder that even in the midst of a crisis state, life has to continue and food is an enduring common bond. And this anti-doom-and-gloom approach is symptomatic of The Jungle. No tragedy porn here, but rather a portrait of flawed humanity – people doing good, people screwing up, people just trying their damnedest in face of a shameful international emergency.  Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin’s production balances these two essential elements so well. There’s much humour laced through many scenes, a dry wit sliding around scenes that keep spirits as high as they can get. And there’s a clear-sighted frankness about the horror of the situation that was allowed to build up, and the difficulties that come in trying to help out with such a complex mass of issues. The trials of a series of British volunteers have an initial feel of comic relief but along with narrator Safi (an excellent Ammar Haj Ahmad), they prove a crucial entry point into our collective ignorance about the multi-faceted problems experienced by such a multinational grouping. This format means that so many of these experiences are able to be expressed here, naturally some are more fleeting than is ideal but it is a powerful starting point. And the lightness of touch that comes with the humour and with the use of music (composer John Pfumojena delivering beautiful work) means that the tone never dips into preachiness, one never loses sight of how compelling each individual story is, how vital each concern, how unforgivable a blanket response is. Alex Lawther’s gauche Sam with his dreams of urban planning, Ben Turner’s restauranteur and Pfumojena’s Dargur refugee stand out in a truly committed ensemble, but it is the whole thing that is truly magnificent and far from easily forgotten."
1574,1574,Ought To Be Clowns,29/11/2017,Ian,Bad Roads, Royal Court,"Was no fan of Natal’ya Vorozhbit’s Bad Roads I’m afraid. Plays about war in the Ukraine will perhaps predictably be brutal but the experience of watching it doesn’t have to be the same way. Vicky Featherstone’s trailblazing at the Royal Court gets her a long way but it’s hard not to feel the programming has been decidedly mixed and something of a challenge. Too much, for me, in this case."
1575,1575,Ought To Be Clowns,21/01/2015,Ian,Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, Playhouse,"The Broadway production of Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown was less than a stellar success so it is little surprise that it is a majorly reworked version of the show that has opened at the Playhouse Theatre four years later. But even after all the reconstruction and renovation that has been done to Jeffrey Lane’s book and David Yazbek’s score, it is hard to feel that director Bartlett Sher has really nailed it here either. For something based on a Pedro Almodóvar film, there’s a shocking uncertainty of tone, or more accurately a lack of any real sense of tone at all. The story in set in late 80s Madrid but there’s little concession to either this particular decade or country (though there is bafflingly one incongruously Hispanic accent). One could argue that this is a wise decision but the issue lies in that no overarching conceit of any substance has replaced it. So we’re trapped in this vaguely modern, vaguely Western set-up that just constantly errs towards the bland. Hints of surrealism (a dream-like female matador stalks the action, as does a Spanish troubadour) are left less unexploited or played too straight; Sher also uses devices like Brechtian captions to little effect; and the default mode of Yazbek’s score is maudlin balladeering which saps both energy and pace from what is essentially a farce. What saves the show, to a certain extent, is a cracking cast who enhance the material with their skill and hard work. Tamsin Greig reveals herself to be a more than competent musical theatre actress as leading lady Pepa (the mistress) and naturally shines in the more comic moments; Haydn Gwynne provides real gravitas in the show’s one genuinely affecting musical moment in ‘Invisible’ as well as nailing the unhinged mentality of Lucia (the ex-wife); and Seline Hizli also shines (as the ex-wife’s son’s fiancée)."

And it is the latter who have opted to tackle notorious 90s flop musical Moby Dick, a frankly batshit meta-adaptation of the Herman Melville novel by Hereward Kaye and Robert Longden. Moby Dick’s conceit is that it is a show-within-in-a-show, the students and staff of St Godley’s Academy for Girls putting on a performance in order to save their school, and what a frantically high-energy performance it is. So much so that it’s frightfully difficult to work out exactly what the hell is going on – a tongue-in-cheek synopsis of Moby Dick (the novel) is helpfully provided but there’s no guide to navigating the whirlpool of this production.  Directed by noted choreographer Andrew Wright, it amps up the self-referential campery to wearying levels – there isn’t a joke which isn’t done to death, a visual reference that isn’t hammered home repeatedly, it’s a bit like being asked ‘do you get it yet?’ over and over. Musically it is heavy-handed too, giving a sense of overload and making you wonder if being swallowed by a whale might not be the worst way to go."

IMOGENÉ: the improvised pop concert promises all of this and delivers more in a highly amusing hour of made-up pop songs, crowd-surfing antics and audience banter which is deceptively slight, smuggling in some on-the-point truths about some weighty themes. The show sets itself up as a rare chance to see an intimate concert of the megastar IMOGENÉ (once she’s got off the helicopter from Tokyo natch) and since she’s about to head into the studio with Mark Ronson, we gotta help her write some new songs. So dial down your inhibitions and toss your suggestions into the hat as there’s nothing quite like having a spangly leotard serenade you and lead you into some kind of new enlightened state of being. Queen feminist clown Imogen Palmer gets the atmosphere just right with her over-the-top stage presence, settling us all at ease even whilst getting all up in there. And she’s clearly skilled at drawing out the stories and details she can use to whip up into an album of feminist rock songs, downright filthy grindathons and chant-a-long stadium anthems, whilst nailing the light-hearted but serious intent of promoting nothing so simple as kindness."
1579,1579,Ought To Be Clowns,30/04/2011,Ian,Electra, Gate Theatre,"This version of Electra by Nick Payne which is currently playing at the Gate Theatre is brand new, but it does bear some resemblance to the production Elektra, which played, for free, at the Young Vic last summer. That version was by Anne Carson was a co-production with Headlong but is now being labelled the workshop production of this one, as it was also directed by Carrie Cracknell and featured the same creative team around her here, indeed one of the actresses involved has travelled too though Cath Whitefield has been promoted from the chorus to the title role. Based on Sophocles’ Ancient Greek myth, the story centres on Electra, seething with rage at the murder of her father Agamemnon at the hand of her mother Clytemnestra, who in turn was avenging his sacrifice of another of their daughters, Iphigenia, to appease the gods for a prevailing wind. Electra ships off her younger brother to safety but remains with her mother and new lover, silently plotting for the chance to take the ultimate revenge in the memory of her father and praying for a brother she has not seen for ten years. I enjoyed last year’s Elektra but I have to say I loved this one as it was recognisable to some extent in its use of movement and music and a few key scenes, but it is also full of new, inspired choices. Holly Waddington’s design situates the audience in single file along the lengths of the room allowing the action to play in traverse to great effect, which is created by Guy Hoare’s highly atmospheric lighting which conceals as much as it illuminates, no bad thing considering the violence contained within this vengeful family. Making the chorus a younger version of Electra also works exceptionally well, played here by Fern Deacon, often singing a set of haunting duets, composed by Tom Mills, with her older self. Best of all though is the opening sequence of a series of spotlighted images emerging from the darkness which illustrate the mental state of most of the main characters before the play proper begins. Cracknell inspires bruisingly intense performances from her cast, which just add to the claustrophobia in this already small space. Cath Whitefield is a tower of clenched, barely suppressed rage as the anguished Electra, her flashes of angry energy are genuinely disturbing and one can sense the struggle she has to deal with the return of her long-gone brother Orestes, played with blood-thirsty zeal by Alex Price. They are counterpointed well by Natasha Broomfield’s more composed Chrysothemis whose hidden pain is possibly more moving than Electra’s tantrums and they are united against their mother Clytemnestra , a slinkily manipulative Madeleine Potter who was sadly under-used."

And a motley crew they make up, punching hard with a raw energy that is variable and visceral and vocal and vibrant. From a National Lottery driven to dystopian extremes to the desperate measures people are driven to by the bedroom tax, from audience apathy and wilful blindness to rapacious capitalist greed depleting the world’s natural resources, the evening swirls around contemporary concerns with fervent passion which occasionally strikes home most effectively. Franzmann’s The Most Horrific works best here, fiercely indicting the way in which so much bad news is so easily dismissed by a desensitised audience. Ellams’ Reset Everything and Lustgarten’s The Finger of God explored a dark vein of comedy as ways to fix the bedroom tax (blow up your spare room) and the National Lottery (add ever-grisly punishments in with the prizes) were investigated by the resourceful multi-roling company of four – Faith Alabi, Ruairi Conaghan, Ruth Gibson and Conor MacNeill all sharing the limelight (with stage debutant Alabi emerging particularly impressively)."
1583,1583,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Dumbledore Is So Gay, VAULT Festival,"There’s something beautifully sweet about Dumbledore Is So Gay, a LGBT+ rom-com set in a world of magical realism that gives you hope that things can sometimes get better. Written by Robert Holtom (The Cluedo Club Killings) and directed by Tom Wright (My Dad’s Gap Year, which I now wish I’d seen), it is an adorably funny piece of theatre with a fair amount of potential. Age 12, Jack can’t stop getting a boner in French class every time he looks at his best friend Ollie but as his parents change the channel when Graham Norton comes on, he knows he can’t be honest about himself. As the years go by, key relationships develop but not always in the way he is expecting so at a crucial moment, he decides to whip out his time-turner and do it all over again, only better this time.  Holtom threads in a lot of issues concerning contemporary LGBT+ life – depression and teen suicide rates in the community, sexual consent in gay bars, appreciation for our elders and their struggles, not to mention the age-old topics of internalised homophobia, coming out to your parents and fancying the pants of your mate. There’s a lightness of touch though that prevents Dumbledore… from ever seeming too worthy and plenty of laughs worked into the script. There really is a lot of amusing detail packed into the writing and Holtom uses its construction extremely well. French teacher Madame Dubois deserves her own spin-off, possibly teamed up with Old Norman, and it is the way that these supplementary characters are fleshed out through each iteration of the story that really works. Tom Wright’s direction makes excellent use of Charlotte Dowding and Max Percy to play all the supporting characters in Jack’s life and both really impress, whether with grinding dance moves or playing a scene with two characters by themself. "
1584,1584,Ought To Be Clowns,23/06/2014,mag9l,Idomeneus, Gate Theatre,"There’s a wonderful synchronicity in the arrival of Roland Schimmelpfennig’s Idomeneus at the Gate Theatre at the same time that the divisive Mr Burns is in residence at the Almeida, both plays toy wonderfully with ideas of cultural narrative and how stories get passed down through the generations. And it is tempting to think that had this opened first – with its reference point being classicist-friendly Greek tragedy as opposed to the apparently alienating The Simpsons – the response to that latter play might have been a little different with the larger theme already established in the mind. Who knows though and in some respects, who cares. It really feels like there’s a current vein of theatre that is striking out on its own – it may leave critics scurrying away at intervals or declaring their worst nights ever but by the same token, one might argue that that is how these theatremakers feel whilst sitting through the latest lauded revival of a Noël Coward play (I may or may not have borrowed this idea from someone… ;-)). But at the Almeida, the Royal Court and now the Gate, you can find theatre that really is unafraid to be different – it’s not to say that it is automatically good but even the mere act of stretching what we know as theatre in the UK feels important. Back to the play at hand though. Schimmelpfennig’s Idomeneus – presented here in a translation by David Tushingham – evokes the oldest school of storytelling as its cast of five form a Greek chorus to tell us the tale of the King of Crete on his way home from the battle of Troy. But separating truth from fiction is more difficult than it seems, myth intertwines with history, competing narratives strive for supremacy, perhaps fruitlessly so as it seems the pre-destined fates of us all are quite literally in the hands of the gods. "
1585,1585,Ought To Be Clowns,04/11/2015,mag9l,The Glass Menagerie, Richmond,"And so to the second of three The Glass Menageries in a month for me. Ellen McDougall’s production for Headlong has already played extensive runs in Leeds and Liverpool before nipping down to Richmond and Warwick for a week each and I was glad of the opportunity to see this most intriguing of directors (Henry the Fifth, Idomeneus, Anna Karenina) take on Tennessee Williams’ classic memory play. With ‘a frustrated mother, a daughter lost in her imagination, and a son intent on rebellion’, all this family needs to tip it right over the edge is an inopportune visit from a gentleman caller. Whereas Samuel Hodges layered up the Wingfields’ existence with a scrapbook full of video references and visual cues, McDougall goes the opposite way in stripping the play to its bare bones, excavating existence through bodies alone with minimal props. Fly Davis’ design suspends the black box of Tom’s mind above water in which naturally only he can paddle, a space in which his memories play out or are perhaps trapped, like the characters themselves. A staircase at the rear leads only into darkness, there’s no real escape possible from the drudgery of life with all its anecdotes repeated ad nauseam.  And liberated from naturalism, the acting takes on a nightmarish quality. Greta Scacchi’s Amanda has rarely been this highly-strung, forever on the edge of an actual tizzy whether reminiscing about those jonquils or over-excitedly welcoming the long-awaited gentleman caller into supper. Tom Mothersdale’s Tom is an appealing narrator, dolefully watching over the audience as they enter and the action as it unfolds at his instigation, Erin Doherty’s painfully withdrawn Laura at times distressing to watch, pressing herself against the wall or the floor as if she could melt herself away. "
1586,1586,Ought To Be Clowns,07/12/2016,mag9l,She Loves Me, Menier,"The Menier’s festive musical is always to look forward to and this year’s is no exception – a revival of the classic She Loves Me, based on Miklós László’s play Parfumerie which has been remade more than once as films The Shop Around The Corner, In The Good Old Summertime, and You’ve Got Mail. Recently seen on Broadway in a superlative rendition that was the first ever show to be live-streamed there, Joe Masterhoff’s book pits warring Budapest shop employees Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash against each other, little knowing that they are corresponding anonymously through a lonely hearts column – will they get together in the end? What do you think? Matthew White’s production is as pretty as a picture, as a music box in fact, Paul Farnsworth’s luxe design emerging as an exceptional piece of work, using four mini revolves to great effect – the shop’s interior looks particularly stunning. And blessed with such cachet, and the strong possibility of a West End transfer, the venue once again attracts a top-notch cast. Mark Umbers and Scarlet Strallen alternately spar and swoon as the main lovers, real life couple Dominic Tighe and Katherine Kingsley play fellow amorous employees Ilona and Kodaly, even relatively minor roles like Ladislav get the likes of Alastair Brookshaw playing them. And with such quality, the show can’t help but shimmer like a bauble under the fairy lights. With Jerry Bock’s supremely tuneful score to hand, played gorgeously under Catherine Jayes’ musical direction, Strallen’s crystalline soprano and Umbers’ genial warmth make their love/hate struggle highly watchable. And the distribution of the good songs means everyone gets a chance to shine – Mr Tighe’s indecently rapturous presence, Cory English’s hilarious maître d’, Les Dennis’ avuncular shop owner. Kingsley would steal the show with her wry Ilona but Callum Howells’ delivery boy Arpad whisks it from under her nose with a lovable cheekiness.  But for all that She Loves Me is giddily enjoyable, it’s also another example of a slightly worrying trend towards conservatism. As with Half A Sixpence, the show leans heavily into the comfort of the nostalgic and whilst there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, it’s another major musical that presents us with an all-white cast. And if you’re of a mind to think ‘well, Budapest in the 1930s wouldn’t have black people in it’, Howells’ Arpad Laszlo is played with a broad Welsh accent, Kingsley’s Ilona Ritter is cockney(ish) so the ‘traditional’ argument just doesn’t wash. For it’s not about accuracy, musicals such as these aren’t anything like documentaries. What they are, or what they should aim to be IMHO, is a reflection of the societies in which they play. And in Britain in 2016, and in London in particular, that we can have shows like this, like Half A Sixpence, like Soho Cinders, which haven’t got a single person of colour in their casts feels wrong and a betrayal of the huge potential that theatre has to expand our minds. We need to do better, which is an odd note on which to end this review of a lovely show but if we don’t start these conversations now, when will we?"
1587,1587,Ought To Be Clowns,18/10/2016,mag9l,The Red Barn, National,"On booking for The Red Barn, you’re advised that “due to the tense nature of the play, there will be no re-admittance”. The play – written by David Hare from the 1968 novel La Main by Georges Simenon – is also described as a psychological thriller on the website. It all adds up to a certain degree of expectation about what kind of show it is one is going to see and even though this isn’t my first time at the rodeo, I’ve seen a few shows and know the danger of anticipation, it is often hard not to carry the weight of those expectations with you as you take your seat. Which is a roundabout way of saying that Robert Icke’s production of The Red Barn was not the play I thought it would be. And that my initial slightly cool reaction was as much a response to that as it was to the material itself. Set in the depths of a Connecticut winter, two couples make their way home from a party and when one of the men doesn’t make it back, it is the consequences of that that makes up the meat of the play. Specifically, it’s how the other man of the group reacts, both right then and from then on, that Simenon and Hare and Icke probe into. And with Mark Strong at the helm as this model of quiet desperation – a lawyer called Donald Dodd – it’s a subtly devastating portrayal of masculine inadequacy, quiet and measured in its approach and some tableaux even play out like still life paintings. Whether interacting with the unflinching pragmatism of his wife Ingrid or the strange allure of his friend’s widow Mona, played exceptionally by Hope Davis and Elizabeth Debicki respectively, deep emotional truths are stripped back layer by layer as we get closer to the ‘truth’ of what happened, not just on that fateful night but also leading up to it."
1588,1588,Ought To Be Clowns,20/11/2016,mag9l,Women Centre Stage: Power Play Festival – New Women,,"There was undoubtedly a lot of theatre during the Women Centre Stage: Power Play Festival but for me, the New Women session in the middle of the day was the highlight – three cracking pieces which variously looked to the past, the present and the future to thrilling effect. We started with a group new to me – The Hiccup Project – two Brighton based performers blurring the lines between dance, comedy, and theatre to create a most beguiling form of performance art. Somewhat confessional, somewhat quirky, altogether fun, Cristina Mackerron and Chess Dillon-Reams’ May-We-Go-Round was a delight and a canny piece of programming as it was unlike anything else in all 10 hours of the day, made me excited to see further work by them and if nothing else, reminded us all of the benefits of a good skip. Looking to the past, Winsome Pinnock’s Tituba embroiders a rich emotional life for the character who almost incidentally appears in Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. Inspired by Tituba, Reluctant Witch of Salem by Professor Elaine Breslaw, Pinnock’s Tituba puts her at the centre of her own story, her own slave narrative, and through eloquent words and elegantly primal movement, Cecilia Noble makes her a hugely compelling protagonist, a woman rewriting a history that has been otherwise been erased – one of the recurring themes of how women can and should be claiming centre stage."
1589,1589,Ought To Be Clowns,22/08/2007,Ian,Little Shop of Horrors, Ambassadors,"It is a very sweetly composed story, straddling that not-so-well-trodden boundary between sci-fi and romance. Seymour, a down-on-his-luck orphan just scraping by in grim urban Skid Row, finds a special plant which happens to appear during a solar eclipse and suddenly everything in his life starts to improve. The flower shop where he works becomes more successful, he sees a way to rescue the girl he loves from afar from a violent relationship, but as always, there’s a downside to all of this and in this case, it is that the plant is a living, carnivorous one with a particular yen for human blood. As I said, I didn’t get round to seeing this show in its previous venues since I wasn’t sure that it would be as good as I wanted it to be in my head as I do know the story rather well, having been involved in a high school production and I really do love the film (of the musical, that is). But fortunately, I was not disappointed by this production at all as the strong voices of Katie Kerr, Melitsa Nicola and Jenny Fitzpatrick as the doo-wop girl chorus kicked in with the title song and their energy lifted us through the show with great verve. Above all it is a funny show, mixing in real comedy in both the book and the lyrics with genuine pathos in the grim surroundings and domestic violence in Skid Row, with a great energy, a surprising ending and crucially for any musical, excellent songs from Alan Menken. They cover the aforementioned doo-wop of the girl group chorus and Motown, bluesy romps, rock’n’roll numbers and simple heartfelt ballads. Sheridan Smith captured the genuine humanity behind Audrey, elevating her from a caricature to a real woman with feelings and a heart she’s so careful to protect. Her singing voice is lovely too and often heart-breakingly sincere, especially in her dreams of a better life. Paul Keating’s Seymour is nicely earnest, playing the transformation from nerd to whiz-kid well and Alistair McGowan’s dentist is well performed too, getting the sadistic laughs in but not overpoweringly so and I love the fact he’s not too showy to cover lots of little roles in the second act too."
1590,1590,Ought To Be Clowns,22/10/2014,Ian,The Rivals, Arcola,"With a wicked glint in her eye and wryly pursed lips, an extravagantly dressed Gemma Jones ensures her Mrs Malaprop reaches the very pineapple of her comic potential and with no less captivating humour, Nicholas Le Prevost makes even the lewdest of Sir Anthony Absolute’s comments a hilarious part of his incorrigible charm. They have decided that her niece Lydia Languish and his son Captain Jack Absolute are an ideal match but young Lydia – an outrageous Jenny Rainsford who plays her on the edge of sanity to hugely entertaining effect – has her heart set on the romantic, and penniless, hero of her dreams. Naturally, this man – Ensign Beverley – is Jack in disguise (a raffish Iain Batchelor who matches Rainsford for derring-do and commitment), aiming to woo her by stealth but in dealing with Mrs Malaprop’s misspoken morals and Sir Anthony’s paternal preferences, they all tie themselves in terrible knots. And this being high season in Bath, everyone is in some sort of a tizzy and Cadell manages to clearly define the multiple plot strands and engage us fully in them all in a brilliant first half that just flies by with verve and vigour."
1591,1591,Ought To Be Clowns,16/11/2010,Ian,The Glass Menagerie, Young Vic,"Continuing the Young Vic’s 40th anniversary season, a new revival of Tennessee Williams’ classic The Glass Menagerie arrives in the main house directed by Joe Hill-Gibbins and featuring an exciting cast. One of his earliest plays and consequently one of his most autobiographical, it is set in 1937 in the city of St Louis, Missouri where the Wingfields live close to the poverty line. Mother Amanda dreams of her girlhood in the Deep South and the husband that left her, son Tom dreams of leaving his full factory job and pursuing his dreams and fragile daughter Laura is happy as she is in her own quiet world but as her mother is determined to secure a better future for the children, she pushes Tom to finding a suitable ‘gentleman caller’ for his sister with devastating effects. Opening with an introduction to the world of memory plays, for this is what The Glass Menagerie is, narrated by an older version of Tom, the action starts with a gorgeous little coup de theatre revealing the Wingfields’ apartment on the corner stage. As Dario Marianell’s music is played live on stage by Eliza McCarthy on the piano and Simon Allen on a range of instruments including music boxes and a table of water glasses which provide a beautifully evocative soundscape: Allen also provides live sound effects which are neatly done, especially on the staircase and James Farncombe’s evocative lighting shines across the stage, the play is atmospherically set somewhere between memory and reality, helped by the levels built into Jeremy Herbert’s set design. I have made no secret of my admiration for Deborah Findlay, I think she is one of our most under-rated actresses, equally at home in cutting modern pieces as she is costume dramas and she adds another dimension here as frustrated, uprooted and overbearing Southern belle Amanda. A beautifully layered performance, her wistful recollection of the jonquils from her youth is spine-tingling but it is paired with a practicality that makes you realise she knows her dreams are dreams and not reality and far from being overtly cruel, she is just unable to equip her children with the skills they need to survive this tough world and unaware of the effect she has on them. Happy in her safe closeted world with her crystalline companions that form the titular collection, Sinéad Matthews excels as the painfully nervous Laura, terrified at the prospect of interactions with others as her mother so longs for, her lack of confidence exacerbated by her physical limitations and a verbal tic which is sensitively portrayed but there’s a grace to her too which tugs at the heartstrings. So during the beautifully done final scene in the living room as her gentleman caller begins to awaken the woman in her, whisking her around a makeshift dancefloor before returning her to reality, the emotional investment in this loner with whom Williams’ own sister is most closely identified results in nigh on perfection. Kyle Soller as Jim, the man who comes to dinner, does well with a nice Matt Smith-like energy, tempering the shamelessness of his behaviour with a believable affability but it is Leo Bill who really impresses with a performance of great maturity and sensitivity. As the narrator of the story, of his memories, as well as an integral part, he plays the frustrations of a trapped repressed soul who is with his family in some respects but so far from them in others and the weight that he bears as a result of the decisions he has made haunts the speeches he makes to us. The connections between all the actors are substantial and incredibly strong given the show is still in preview and the voice work from all is good, everyone in tune with the easy rhythm of the playwright’s voice. I have long been resigned to the fact that I have a different sense of humour to most theatrical audiences and it was the same here with plenty of laughs coming throughout, sometimes in the most random of places. I think it really does make a difference if you know the plot though as what may seem comic is imbued with a great sadness when one knows the truth. And indeed I think it was this weight of expectation that resulted in me being the only one in the group to wiping tears away at the end. I do maintain though that this show features some of Williams’ most beautiful writing, exploring the complex family dynamics of his own life through the Wingfields, the impact of personal decisions on others and the cost of escape: Tom’s final speech, from which the quote at the top is taken, slays me every single time. With the introduction of reserved seating and proper reduced price previews, alongside its hip bar on The Cut, the team here on the South Bank is doing excellent work at improving the whole theatrical experience at their venue to match the exciting programming. And with this achingly beautiful production of a truly great play, I’d highly recommend a trip to the Young Vic. I endorse your recommendation to see the Glass Menagerie. I really enjoyed the production. One point however, the Young Vic is celebrating 40 years not 50. Thanks for pointing that out, must have got carried away. Glad you enjoyed the production too. Thanks for this review, you've completely convinced me to book tickets for it now!"
1592,1592,Ought To Be Clowns,03/11/2019,Ian,Soho Cinders, Charing Cross Theatre,"I have great affection for Stiles & Drewe’s musical Soho Cinders, from its concert beginnings to a starry Soho Theatre production to a warm revival at the Union Theatre, its escapist fun nature and tuneful score remain quietly appealing. And it is that last Union production that has been reconceived for a new run at the Charing Cross Theatre, featuring some of the same cast members and beefed up with newcomers from Six and Jamie. The show is a loose LGBT+ adaptation of the Cinderella story, updated to a contemporary London setting, albeit an improbably affordable and innocent pre-smartphone age. Robbie is a young man struggling to make ends meet with his Old Compton Street laundrette and consequently dallying with a sugar daddy, despite simultaneously hooking up with prospective mayoral candidate James Prince, who just happens to have a fiancée. It’s a daft plot but amiable, even if it doesn’t bear too much close scrutiny (clandestine meetings in Trafalgar Square?!). "
1593,1593,Ought To Be Clowns,11/10/2015,mag9l,Showstopper, Apollo,"The beauty of improvised musical show The Showstoppers is that you can go as many times as you want as they make it up fresh for every performance. So even though I saw two performances on their press day last week, I was more than happy to go again this Sunday evening, this time to experience the delights of Jim’s Soggy Bottom. "
1594,1594,Ought To Be Clowns,23/12/2011,Ian,Our Country’s Good, Radio 4,"Funnily enough, I have seen neither play before but have tickets to see both in the early months of next year: Our Country’s Good at the Rose, Kingston and The Recruiting Officer at the Donmar, and I hadn’t realised the connection between the two before starting the first play. Timberlake Wertenbaker’s Our Country’s Good is based on a novel by Thomas Keneally which tells the true story of Lieutenant Ralph Clark’s 1789 attempts to put on a production of George Farquhar’s play The Recruiting Officer using a cast of convicts in a penal colony in New South Wales. This radio production was then followed by the convicts’ version of The Recruiting Officer, using much of the same cast. I really enjoyed the play as it plays with ideas of the power of theatre especially as a tool for creating a sense of community and also in its potential to rehabilitate prisoners as the survival of the colonies in Australia were dependent on a population working together. The governing military men considered themselves a class apart and the clear divisions between those that believed in the ability of theatre as a rehabilitative, educational exercise and those that didn’t believe that the prisoners deserved anything other than the harshest treatment forms the crux of the drama as the rehearsals open up new opportunities, new visions and new challenges for the prisoners and guards alike."
1595,1595,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2013,Ian,I Know How I Feel About Eve, Hampstead Downstairs,"I do like a bit of Kirsty Bushell and have decided she is one of the many actresses that I will now go to see in everything she does. Which meant a trip to the Hampstead Downstairs for Colette Kane’s play I Know How I Feel About Eve, an unusual twist on a domestic tragedy which plays out rather interestingly across its short running time. Jo and Alex are an archetypal young professional couple but something has gone wrong, something that can’t be fixed until Jo finds Gloria and the rather exceptional service that her organisation provides. It’s a vague description and deliberately so, I wouldn’t want to reveal much more as the surprises of the play depend on it but it’s safe to say that though the plot stretches credulity in its somewhat surreal reaches, it forms an effective way in which to explore the trials and machinations of the issue that is plaguing Jo and Alex. And it is sensitively done, though a little simplistically heavy-handed at times as it strives to reach an overly neat conclusion when it could either have kept a stronger note of ambiguity or taken a little longer to get there. Lisa Spirling’s production is light on its feet – excellently cast with Bushell all brittle exterior as the hula-hopping barrister Jo and Christopher Harper softer as the easily distracted writer Alex – though the strains on their relationship are detailed a little too vociferously, the vicious banter between them a little too much though as Michele Austin’s Gloria arrives to put options on the table, the sniping decreases to a more bearable level as the main argument comes into play."
1596,1596,Ought To Be Clowns,23/01/2014,Ian,The Light Princess, National Theatre,
1597,1597,Ought To Be Clowns,21/11/2018,Ian,Heart of Darkness, Birmingham REP,"Are some stories just too problematically complex to tell in today’s society? Or is there value in trying to pick them apart, to get to the heart of them in an attempt to understand? imitating the dog clearly cleave to the latter point of view as they forensically dissect Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (“it’s of its time, and that time is racist”) in this hugely thought-provoking production which creates a film noir-inspired adaptation in front of us. Andrew Quick and Pete Brooks’ reworking is breath-taking in the formal invention of its scope, exploring the intersection of theatre and technology as well as thoroughly interrogating the text. So discussions about the inherent problems of the story smash up against striking effect-laden work on a green screen, spoken stage directions nestle next to a lip-synced Francis Ford Coppola. It’s a sensory overload. 
Which proves to be both a strength and something of a weakness for the show. It is just so clever and considered and ingeniously constructed that you can’t but be lost in wonder at the inventiveness of it all. But there’s also a point where its metatextual tricksiness feels a touch calculated, the act of storytelling too dominant over what is being presented, to allow its audience a moment for their own consideration, their own emotional response."
1598,1598,Ought To Be Clowns,05/06/2011,Ian,American Trade, RSC at Hampstead Theatre,"And so to complete the set… Having initially declared that I was fine with not seeing any of the RSC new commissions at the Hampstead Theatre when they were announced, I’ve now seen all three of them, Tarell Alvin McCraney’s American Trade following on from Little Eagles and Silence in what has been, to be completely honest, a rather underwhelming season. Billed as a contemporary Restoration comedy, this is an ultra-modern, breakneck 90 minutes of multi-coloured, multi-racial, multi-sexual shenanigans, which also happens to mark Jamie Lloyd’s RSC directorial debut. This was a preview performance on the evening of Saturday 4th June. Insofar as the plot is concerned, young New York hustler Pharus is offered a golden chance to escape his increasingly tricky situation when an unexpected offer from his unknown English Great-Aunt Marian to run a new modelling agency as part of her PR firm comes through. So he crosses the ocean and make a good impression but ends up finding he is best at what he knows and so the model agency becomes a cover for a prostitution racket. But his cousin Valentina, heir presumptive to the business, is not happy with the new arrival and the threat he poses, so she sets about trying to uncover his murky past whilst trying to work her PR spin on a children’s film star who has gone seriously off the rails. The whirl around Pharus and Valentina involves a whole raft of characters as they each try to secure their own position whilst trying to shaft the other and whilst there’s much that is funny about the weird and wacky sorts that appear, there’s something overly studious and contrived about the ‘diversity’ on display – the desire to capture the multi-culturalism of modern-day London taken to ridiculous extremes. And though the sexual games on play and boy there’s lots of them with no holds barred – Geoffrey Freshwater in a blue thong, Gruffydd Glyn in S+M gear and some mighty stilettos, Sheila Reid in a basque, Tunji Kasim in his Calvin Kleins for an unreasonable length of time, there’s really something for everyone here – are often raucous fun, there’s just too much of it which unbalances the play. So the rare moments of introspection, like when Marian sees Pharus for the first time and seeing the ghost of her nephew in his face or Sophie Russell’s statuesque Valentina trying to tell her lesbian lover how much she means to her, fail to convince or gel within the fast-paced structure. Soutra Gilmour’s graffiti-covered and day-glo coloured set with its multiple doors is the perfect playing space for this brash piece and McCraney displays some nice flashes of humour, especially in the constantly recurring role of Girl Wonder, a brilliant performance from Debbie Korley who variously pops up on Pharus’ journey as a dancer, flight attendant, TfL worker, hotel receptionist, always bolshy and always funny. Ultimately as a piece of entertainment, American Trade certainly delivers and often in the most unexpected of ways. And once again, it serves the purpose of showing off the Ensemble in a completely different light, oozing with modernity here and in several cases revealing more than can ever have been reasonably expected. But as a piece of new writing, it is hard to see how this passed muster as there is just so little substance to it: the promotional speak talks of how it challenges assumptions about racial and sexual identity but all it really challenges is who is making the decision about these new plays for the RSC. Think you're being far too lenient on it. Absolute trash and all concerned should be ashamed of themselves. No wonder it is only doing a limited run"
1599,1599,Ought To Be Clowns,22/08/2010,Ian,Deathtrap, Noël Coward Theatre,"It’s a funny thing the theatre: when Deathtrap was first announced, I had little interest in going to see it. I’m not particularly enamoured (even though I know it is probably heretical) of Simon Russell Beale, I’ve never seen Glee so the name Jonathan Groff meant nothing to me and even when Estelle Parson was announced, replacing Anna Massey, it was another name that meant nothing to me. So, cultural ignoramus that I apparently am, it took some persuasion to get me to go along to the first preview. But given that there is a very good deal on preview tickets (which is still available now), off I trotted to the Noël Coward Theatre. Deathtrap is a 1978 comedy thriller by Ira Levin about Sidney Bruhl, a has-been playwright who is now reduced to living off his wealthy wife in Connecticut so when he receives a fresh exciting new play, also entitled Deathtrap, from one of his former students, he decides it is good enough to kill for. I really can’t say more than that without ruining it, but safe to say that the plot is full of sinister twists and turns, reversals, double crosses, and possibly even triple crosses. This is a spoiler-free review but if you have no idea about the story then maybe you should read it after you’ve seen it in case I inadvertently give anything away. It is good but for a thriller, it takes a long time to become, well, thrilling. The first act is so full of talking and whilst Russell Beale throws out bon mot after witty one-liner (so much so it is hard to believe that the character has authored so many flops), it did begin to flag for me. Then, once the shenanigans begin, it bursts into life and the surprises and shocks come flying at you with an impressive verve. Maybe the ‘slow’ beginning is deliberate in order to maximise the impact of what is to follow but I would hope the pacing improves some before opening night. But then, in the second act it suffers the same problem, of being overly wordy, especially straight after the interval. Part of the issue is the constant self-referencing: the amazing play being tussled over is also called Deathtrap and the characters in the play are aware of the fact that what is happening to them would make a great play and there’s a lot of recapping of what has happened so the suspense that has built up dissipates somewhat. Whilst the device of the characters writing their own ending in front of us should be amazing, it doesn’t quite yet have the requisite ominous feeling that a thriller needs until we’re near the end. I can’t really comment on the performances as to do so would reveal too much, but safe to say fans of Simon Russell Beale won’t be disappointed as he has a sardonic comic character with nicely hidden depth suggested at throughout and had a good relationship with Claire Skinner as his nervy wife Myra. Jonathan Groff as the younger playwright Clifford makes an appealing West End debut, Terry Beaver does well in the minor part of Porter Milgrim, a New York lawyer, but I left a little bemused by Estelle Parsons as local psychic Helga. She was good, although there were some projection issues which combined with her thick accent meant I lost a fair few of her lines, but I was surprised to see her every exit get a round of applause, there was clearly a lot of affection for her. The set looks impressive, a wooden floored study in the Buhler’s cabin with a nice set of rafters and dressed well, full of armoury and weaponry and also a bizarrely furry staircase. It allows for the twists and turns to be played out most effectively, enhanced by Hugh Vanstone’s lighting and Simon Baker’s sound. If you do not know the story, then this will be great fun for you, as it doesn’t really outstay its welcome even if it drags occasionally (this was a first preview after all) but I do wonder how substantial it really is. The thriller element is good but not the most sophisticated and so if you know the twists already, I’m not sure how gripping it would be for you. I could be wrong, but this was an entertaining enough evening at the theatre anyway.   Did you hear the kid shout ""ew, disgusting"" at the clinch? Quite depressing that kind of behaviour in one so young and so unashamedly as well.Liked the play, didn't love it. Thought Skinner was a little weak and needs to work on her accent. I just now got to read this and I think you didn't give anything away. Amusingly enough J was making jokes about there being a ""bad shag on the stairs"" which we thought a very amusing pun. Aren't we juvenile? Anyway, enjoyable to read – I actually felt the tension becoming palpable during the act-opening dialogue bits and was actually relieved when they broke into ""the action"" as my nerves were totally on the edge! I found it distinctly average: not funny enough for a comedy, not thrilling enough for a thriller and whilst hamming it up is fine, too much of it was farcical (Parsons' accent was all over the place and far too unclear even from sixth row of the stalls)Can't see this one lasting. Highly entertaining bit of fluff – well worth price of admission….."
1600,1600,Ought To Be Clowns,20/11/2019,Ian,[BLANK], Donmar Warehouse,"On the face of it, [BLANK] has all the makings of an outright success. With Alice Birch writing and Maria Aberg, this Donmar Warehouse and Clean Break co-production is a powerful indictment of how the vicissitudes of our criminal justice system hit women, and their families, the hardest by far. And in terms of a text, it is undoubtedly an audacious undertaking, consisting of 100 scenes from which directors can craft their own narratives. Here though is where the production doesn’t quite click, Aberg trying her best to form some, any, kind of flow but the form just doesn’t allow for it.  Pushing hard at a wide range of issues – parental neglect, mental health problems, societal isolation, cheap drugs – which cycle hard into vicious circles that lap every aspect of the criminal justice system, this is brutal, often heart-breaking work. Thusitha Jayasundera and Zainab Hasan stand out in one of the few threads to recur as a mother tries to stick by her addict daughter."
1601,1601,Ought To Be Clowns,31/01/2012,Ian,Absent Friends, Harold Pinter Theatre,"One of his earlier works from 1974, Absent Friends sees Ayckbourn train his aim on death and the different ways people deal with it. Colin’s old friends are holding a Saturday afternoon tea party to comfort him after the unfortunate death of his fiancee but as they attempt to step gingerly around the topic, he is more than willing to talk about her, their short time together and show his photo collection to everyone. But what Colin is blithely unaware of is that the perfect lives that he imagines they are all living are a sham and behind the forced smiles over the sandwiches, lies a seething mass of jealousy, anger and frustration that is coming to the boil and it becomes apparent that it is not him whose really in need of tea and comfort. The moments of awkward comedy are where this Jeremy Herrin-directed production really excels, where time and time again as the party guests try to keep the conversation neutral, they put their foot in it by saying the wrong thing. So easily done and so recognisably human, these are played brilliantly by the cast, predominantly by Katherine Parkinson’s edgy host Diana and Elizabeth Berrington’s Marge whose appalled looks of horror are done perfectly as they accidently reference affairs and deaths and cannot resist offering to share in Colin’s stories and the grief they are expecting from him. And it is this feeling of being on the edge that is sustained well, once the first act has set up and warmed up (it took a while at this preview performance…) barely contained emotions on the verge of exploding. Steffan Rhodri’s philandering Paul can scarcely tolerate anyone in his house, especially harsh to his wife (Parkinson’s Diana – nice to see her get a bigger role than she had in Season’s Greetings) and his nervy salesman friend John, a jittery turn from David Armand, who can’t stop trying to push his wares. Kara Tointon delivers a highly amusing impact as the surly Evelyn, possessed of just a handful of lines – most of them ‘no’ – yet speaking volumes with a curled lip, piercing stare or flick of a fabulous hairdo and though she is John’s wife, it is her connection with Paul that is causing a certain amount of froideur in the house. And at the centre of it all is Reece Shearsmith’s chirpy Colin, an old friend who has pretty much fallen out of the loop and so his cheery optimism and determination to find the good in everything fails to see past the veneer of civility on his friends’ faces and ends up exposes the ugliness of feeling all around. Tom Scutt’s set and costume design is minutely observed, the 70s period detail carefully attained across the board, and the performances were generally commendable. So why didn’t it grab me? For me, it is the uncertainty of tone – we seem firmly in tragicomic territory, with the emphasis on the comedy coming from the excruciatingly awkward social unease which hit the mark intermittently for me. But as things get darker, the play hits on an emotional reserve which made me sit up and really engage with the plight of one of the characters. The way that was then casually tossed away with a bizarre diversion into the truly absurd completely shook me out of the moment, crucially failed to make me laugh and consequently left me disgruntled for the rest of the evening. It’s a matter of taste in the end, and once again I find Ayckbourn not to mine. I could just leave it and say each to their own, and if you end up enjoying this production of Absent Friends (as did large swathes of the audience) then I am genuinely happy for you, but I’m never one to let it lie truth be told. I don’t like the way the men are drawn here, suburban archetypes rather than realistic characters; the depiction of misery and regret ends up lacking bite because of the treatment and so the comedic highs are never really balanced by a darker side. But more significantly for me, it all just feels unexceptional as a piece of writing, it illuminated little for me and didn’t entertain me sufficiently to allow me to forgive that. Fully support the reviewer's comments – very well acted, there are some laughs, yet you leave feeling unsatisfied. It is somewhere between farce and thw Royle Family, but lacks the best of both. Overwhelming memory? Reece Sheersmith is Ronnie Corbett in Sorry. Best part of this was the pre and interval soundtrack, if you are of this era  – Rubettes, Bay City Rollers, Slade – there are better ways to pass a cold night (3 days in May at one end and Shrek at the other). Absolutely agree with your review. I stumbled out wondering what it was missing and how it was missing it – and your review nailed it. Agree with the above – and telling that the reviewers loved it to a man. The 1970s aesthetic obviously resonates strongly but blinds them to the sheer lack of sunstance to this piece and smacks of them trying to prop up a show that is struggling to find its audience."
1602,1602,Ought To Be Clowns,13/09/2015,mag9l,VOLTA Festival 2015, Arcola,"One can always rely on the Arcola to bring interesting writing to light and in the form of the VOLTA International Festival, Artistic Director Andrea Ferran has managed that four times over, bringing together new work by four celebrated international writers, translated into English for the first time – Christopher Chen, Jonas Hassen Khemiri, Ewald Palmetshofer and Roland Schimmelpfennig. With four directors, James Perkins designing and an ensemble covering all the shows, it proved to be a fascinating festival and one which deserves more attention than it received. Caught by San Francisco-based Christopher Chen twists wonderfully around notions of truth and fiction as three separate but interlinked scenes toy with how art plays with and changes under our perceptions. Cressida Brown’s direction cleverly plays up how we all find our own truth in everything, no matter how the subject is approached, preconceived notions shaping us even as they’re deconstructed and always, always making us think about what we’ve just seen. Chen takes no prisoners in the complexity of some of his thinking but it’s fascinating stuff indeed. Swedish writer Jonas Hassen Khemiri contributes I Call My Brothers, no less intense but a more internal experience as directed by Yael Shavit. In the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack on a Swedish city, Nabil Elouahabi’s Amor is holed up under suspicion – because he’s Muslim natch – and we follow him for 24 hours as he tries to deal with the situation. It’s a interesting study in Islamophobia in a country who many would consider to be proudly liberal and shows how national interests in the prevention of terrorism have overridden even the most basic of human rights. And as participants in his internal dialogue, Amber Aga, Rachid Sabitiri and Siubhan Harrison all keep things most lively. I had more problems with Ant Street by the German Roland Schimmelpfennig, directed here by Amelia Sears. The idea of magical realism is a hard one to pull off effectively IMHO and what starts off as quirkiness quickly became irritating as the Cuban Sanchez family received a long-awaited parcel of mundane objects that turn out to be much more than they seem. The almost fairytale-like quality is amplified by Sears’ direction which sees the actors, including a strong Ony Uhiara, play up the childlike innocence but I just found the overall effect wanting."
1603,1603,Ought To Be Clowns,11/02/2010,Ian,A Man of No Importance, Arts Theatre,"After a well-received run at the Union Theatre in Southwark, A Man of No Importance has transferred to the West End to the Arts Theatre with a limited run of just 3 weeks. Based on a film from 1995 starring Albert Finney, a cast of 17 and a band of 6 create an utterly charming, warm-hearted piece of musical theatre that will transport you right away from the freezing outside to a very happy place. We’re taken to the world of Alfie Byrne, a bus conductor in 1960s Dublin who lives with his sister, has a passion for amateur dramatics, in particular the works of Oscar Wilde, and is hiding a burning desire for his work colleague, Robbie the driver on his bus. His decision to put on a performance of the controversial ‘Salome’ causes ripples in this Catholic, working-class community that multiply and force Alfie onto a journey of discovery, both of the self and of his relationship to those around him. In the central role, Paul Clarkson is just excellent. As a repressed gay man who knows he can never possess that which he so desires, he is desperately moving, and his penchant for bringing light and culture into the everyday world of his bus customers and theatre group means that one cannot help but fall for him and instantly wish for a happy ending for him. Joanna Nevin as Lily, Alfie’s sister, turns in a masterfully comic, sharing the funniest song of the night in ‘Books’ but also displaying a huge depth of emotion in showing her frustration with her unmarried brother, the sense of wasted possibilities and finally allowing her love for her sibling to shine through and to accept him as he really is: the last of which moved me to tears. Her performance epitomises the understated class of this whole production, her character could easily have degenerated into a ‘Mrs Doyle from Father Ted’ cast-off but the affection that this cast clearly has for this play and their characters shines through. Paul Monaghan‘s gruff butcher Carney is another character that could easily be played as a caricature, but Monaghan captures it perfectly, always keeping him believable. Patrick Kelliher as Robbie, the object of Alfie’s affections and Róisín Sullivan as Adele, the girl chosen to play Salome in their play both also turn in sweet, open performances, and both with excellent solo songs, Kelliher’s ‘Streets of Dublin’ being a highlight for me. And the music composed by Stephen Flaherty really does deserve a special mention as well. It’s simple and unmistakeably Irish but without being twee, the lyrics by Lynn Ahrens are witty and thoughtful and above all, the songs are tuneful. Under Chris Peake’s musical direction, the band is bright and some of the actors even double up as musicians onstage as well. My only criticism would be in the production design, it betrays its fringe roots somewhat and could have done with a little sprucing up as befits a West End audience, but this a minor quibble. I can’t recommend this enough, so don’t miss out on this new opportunity to see this little gem. It may be small in outlook, especially compared to the other musicals on the West End stage, but its impact is genuinely huge and it can call itself at least the equal of anything else currently in London.
   Couldn't agree more. Such a sweet story, not too Ballykissangel stereotypical Irish either. Loved the relationship with his sister too.Just wonder if it'll get the audiences… I don't know, I don't think I've ever been in the Arts Theatre with a full house.I loved Joanna Nevin as the sister almost as much as Paul Clarkson, their relationship was so moving, I do sometimes think if straight people get how sensitively played that was… Is it wrong to say I would say preferred it if she had hammed it up Mrs Doyle style. It was in my head all evening! The songs didn't leave a huge mark on me other than ""Books"" which raised a smile. I'm now rather intrigued to see the film version now. Hehe, I thought she did a good enough job as being the most broadly comic character in there, I don't think I could have coped with a whole load of 'go on go on go on go on go on GO ON!!@"
1604,1604,Ought To Be Clowns,12/03/2014,mag9l,Unusual Unions, Royal Court,"From dressing rooms to stairwells, the space under the stage to meeting rooms with a view, it was a brilliant way of exploring a building which isn’t normally so open (Wilton’s Music Hall’s promenade version of Edmund fulfilled a similar purpose). And even if the subject matter seemed to veer off what one might have expected, given the sexual nature of Morgan’s play, it was still compelling stuff looking at the ways in which we connect (or not) with those around us.  Sibling relationships were clearly playing heavy on the mind of the writing team as three of the five (including the first two we saw) used that as a starting point. Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig’s The Golden Hours saw a brother and sister reunited, after contentious beginnings, after their mother’s death. David Yip and Sarah Lam were both strong with Lam being particularly heart-breaking, the torrents of emotion under her carefully constructed façade impossible to ignore at close quarters. Sarah Ridgeway delivered Rachel De-lehay’s My Twin on the staircase to the Upstairs theatre, a highly intimate monologue about her ever-so-slightly older twin brother and the hugely different ways in which they connect with their family. And Kieran Hurley’s Bruises put two brothers with hugely opposing views in direct conflict – Richard Rankin’s soldier squaring up to Brian Ferguson’s peace activist in one of the more intense moments. Rebecca Lenkiewicz’s Anhedonia had a dark tone too as a woman struggled to come to terms with the sexual abuse she is hiding and unsure how to deal with the builder she is confronted with, Rona Morison and Nathan Osgood dealing sensitively with a brutal subject. And wrapping up a prolific start to 2014, Tom Wells’ Phil in Space was predictably the best of all, a Victoria Wood-esque comic monologue from an older man with a potential ladyfriend, slimming club membership and plans to build a rocket."
1605,1605,Ought To Be Clowns,30/10/2020,Ian,Shift+Alt+Right,,"Theatre folk are nothing if not resourceful and adapting to the pandemic naturally demands creative thinking. But it takes something special to be at the vanguard of such a movement and that is where Adam Lenson and ALP Musicals find themselves as they lead new musical theatre into a brave new world. Written and composed byHilmi Jaidin and directed by Lenson, Shift+Alt+Right is a brand new digital musical that was created to exist online in a self-described hybrid model that blends live performance from a remote company of four and video work from a technological hub, with no two shows being exactly the same. I am loathe to say too much about the show as over its 50 minutes, it manages to pack a lot in and there’s an element of twisty surprise (although it was only once I had started this review that the point of the title actually clicked with me, d’oh!). What is great about Jaidin’s writing is how unafraid he is of going dark, touching on subjects that feel so powerfully resonant today. What I will say is that Max Alexander-Taylor is a revelation as Jay, a young man having a mare of a day and seeking refuge in an online world that seems to offer more than anything IRL. Joanna Clarke, Ashley Goh and Andrew Langtree support him well as three various important figures in his life and the cumulative effect of all this endeavour proves rather thought-provoking, especially in terms of what one has been led to expect when seeing a musical. A quick note too on the impressiveness and affordability of ALP’s approach. £5 is a brilliant price point and the option to buy solidarity tickets, for those experiencing financial instability, at the same time is something that feels much more realistic than, say, buying another ticket at Donmar prices, as commendable their scheme is."
1606,1606,Ought To Be Clowns,09/07/2013,Ian,The Big Ideas- PIIGS, Ireland,"The Irish incarnation of The Big Idea featured Protest by Deirdre Kinehan, with its parents at a school meeting debating the ethics of austerity and particularly the effects that cuts in education threaten to make in their school. It’s quite an intimate piece, its concerns perhaps a little inwards –looking but for me that is where its strengths lie, in dramatizing the kind of everyday situation that people under austerity are facing. It isn’t all headlines news and high-profile decisions, but rather the slowly tightening screw of small cut after small cut taking over almost every aspect of people’s lives. Following that was Kieran Hurley’s Belcoo, a less successful play for me, looking at the G8 protests, as fake shop fronts are erected in a Northern Ireland town and three people debate the ins and outs of plastic fruit. Again though, I found the verbatim pieces more fascinating than the dramatic writing itself, especially the Stephen Carswell section. There’s something truly educational about the staging of such brutally frank conversations about the financial crisis that works so much better than trying to dramatise it fictionally and it would have been good to see at least one play that was entirely based on this format."
1607,1607,Ought To Be Clowns,19/03/2011,Ian,8 Women, Southwark Playhouse,"8 Women might perhaps be better known in this country for its François Ozon film musical incarnation featuring a frankly incredible cast of French film actresses, but it started life as a comedy murder-mystery play by Robert Thomas written in 1958 and reworked in 1961. Donald Sturrock’s translation here at the Southwark Playhouse is largely faithful to the original text although Anglicising some of the more Gallic references, but moves the location to somewhere in the Home Counties and the time to 1980 from 1960. Oh, and unlike the other Catherine Deneuve musical film adaptation currently playing in town, there’s no songs! A businessman has been found murdered in his country house bed at Christmas-time and as there’s a major snowstorm outside leaving them housebound, the suspects are the 8 women in the household: his wife, 2 daughters, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, cook, chambermaid and his own sister. But someone is cutting the phone lines, puncturing the tyres of the car and generally sabotaging any efforts to get away so the women have to try to work out which one of them did it whilst each holding onto their own dark secrets and none of them are being totally honest. It is all rather good fun in a tongue-in-cheek, almost farcical way: the dark comedy is broadly played by most if not all of the women as it emerges that each had a motive as their secrets come to light and relationships are reassessed after revelation follows revelation. The eye of suspicion constantly shifts as jealousies, loyalties, resentments, desires and frustrations emerge Sasha Waddell’s Regan steals the show with her nervy pill-popping drama queen, panicking at every noise and disclosure, but Alice Anthony’s slutty Welsh maid and Bernice Stegers’ no-nonsense Goneril were also eminently watchable. For it to really work though, the ensemble needs to be tighter to make the comedy really fly and the dramatic twists to work: there were too many pauses born of uncertainty but these should be ironed out as the run progresses. Anna Bliss Scully’s set design is a little problematic though, going for the same configuration as The Rivals (running the length of the theatre except inverted) which creates a long thin strips of seating and indeed stage. This is fine in itself but there’s also a landing, a mini-stage with three doors placed awkwardly at the back of the seating area in the middle which is used quite frequently in Elgiva Field’s direction, not for huge amounts of time admittedly but requiring everyone to twist in their seats to see what is happening up there and to be frank, it gets annoying and uncomfortable. More crucially though, it hampers the clarity of the storytelling at a final vital point (I had to explain what happened to the lady next to me) as it is not immediately clear unless you’ve seen it. Having seen (and loved) Ozon’s film version many times, it was a little hard to separate the two and not compare them, especially as they are pretty faithful to one another, musical numbers and one Sapphic encounter notwithstanding, but there is fun to be had here. True, the energy sags a little in the second half and it is not the most sophisticated of comedies, though naming sisters Goneril and Regan is genius and there’s more than enough silly humour in here with some nicely farcical performances that keep the laughter coming as the thriller element plays out, keeping one guessing right until the final revelation. A gallant effort to find positives Ian however as far as I'm concerned Eight Women is possibly the worst piece of theatre I've ever seen.  I've seen better am dram productions then this poorly paced, awfully acted and terribly staged farce.  The whole thing seemed incredibly under rehearsed.  I lost count of the number of missed lines and awkward pauses.  This is only worth watching if you want to experience car crash theatre…funny for all the wrong reasons.  Thank god I only wasted £10 on it! Have to agree with anon. Poor acting, fluffed lines, missed cues and misplaced props."
1608,1608,Ought To Be Clowns,03/07/2011,Ian,Government Inspector, Young Vic,"David Harrower’s version of Gogol’s Russian comedy for the Young Vic is titled simply Government Inspector, losing the definitive article as did the Arcola’s Seagull, marking an odd potential trend for 2011. The inept Mayor of a small Russian town is driven into a frenzy with news of an impending visit from a government inspector but when a conman is mistaken for this visitor, the hypocrisy and corruption that the town’s bigwigs are desperate to hide is exposed. I can’t fairly pass judgement on anything I saw as I didn’t make it to the end. For the first time in about three years, I left at the interval: something I have resisted doing since starting to write reviews properly, although often against my better judgement. And in a week when an article elsewhere about not overdoing it at the theatre mentioned me by name, there was something ironic in the fact that I even arrived to this show since I was pretty sure I wouldn’t like it and several people had warned that they knew I would hate it: my default position is currently seeing as much as is humanly possible whilst (barely) holding down a job in order to expand the breadth of my theatrical experience rather than making considered decisions about what I’m inclined to like. From what I did see, Kyle Soller’s Khlestakov, all got up like a Dalston dandy (I swear I have seen his exact outfit and hairdo at East London warehouse parties over the past few weeks), suggested a powerfully kooky stage presence and Amanda Lawrence continued to prove her extraordinary gift for physical comedy. I couldn’t helped but be disappointed by Barratt’s corresponding lack of ease, underpowered both vocally and physically and one of the main reasons I didn’t return. The other was the simple fact that I didn’t find it funny. My antipathy towards farce is well-documented on here, despite a recent flirtation in Richmond that I did enjoy, but this felt closer to One Man Two Guvnors both in its daftness and in the audience’s determination to laugh at every single thing. That is always an alienating thing especially if you’re not laughing with them from the start, but it hit ridiculous levels in the opening scene here where I was convinced that I was missing something right in front of my very eyes as people were hysterical at Barratt’s every move whilst simply getting dressed. It was interesting to make a first visit to the Young Vic’s gallery seating, well worth a tenner with a sweeping view that isn’t too far away, but the simple fact is that I shouldn’t really have gone along to this. I wanted to form my own opinion, part of the reason why I have embraced so many of the theatrical opportunities offered up to me over the past two years, though there is an ever-persuasive argument that I need to start trusting my instincts, and those of trusted others, a bit more. I've had several experiences over the past couple of years like the one you describe here – alienation in the face of an audience's inexplicable hilarity.  These experiences are both uncomfortable and intellectually fascinating.  From time to time they even edge into the horrifying when I feel that the laughter of the crowd is making me complicit with a politics I find dodgy.  I'm thinking particularly of the couple of uses of blackface in farce I've seen in the last year and a half.  Even when the production seems to be making a subversive point with this device (as Nielson's Realism did), the audience's positive reaction *preceded* the subversion, and I was left feeling a bit queasy.  There was a similar moment last year in the admittedly very funny Posh – I began to wonder whether the laughter of the audience wasn't so much deriding the aristocratic excesses on stage as reveling in them, in the most literal, almost congratulatory way. At any rate, laughter at farce seems to me to be at least as much about ritual and the pleasure of formula as about spontaneity of humor, and that aspect of it fascinates me.  But if you don't engage with (or even know) the generic expectations (I often don't) it can be VERY alienating and sometimes troubling."
1609,1609,Ought To Be Clowns,17/05/2010,Ian,Henry VIII, Shakespeare’s Globe,"Not having seen Henry VIII before, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from the second play in the Kings and Rogues season at Shakespeare’s Globe (this was the second preview) and as delightfully coloured cod-pieces and a mightily impressive heaving bosom (bosoms?) emerged in the course of the first act, I suspected we could be in for a right rollicking good time. This play takes place in the middle of Henry’s reign and follows the rise and fall of four important people in his life, the Duke of Buckingham, his first wife Katherine of Aragon, the Lord Chancellor Cardinal Wolsey and Archbishop Cranmer. It mixes up elements of history, tragedy and romance and wraps it all up in the opulent pageantry of the era but it also allows us to see behind the scenes, the gossiping, the politicking and those moments when the mask slips and we see glimpses of the real people behind the public personae. It is full of stately pomp and circumstance and the set-pieces are visually stunning: Anne Bullen’s procession through the theatre at her coronation, Princess Elizabeth’s christening, even Katherine of Aragon’s trial, all are sumptuously mounted and there are some truly moving moments, especially at the moment of downfall of each of the above-mentioned players. But in truth, Henry VIII plays as a series of episodes rather than a long play and there’s surprisingly little interaction between many of the key characters. This could be to do with the much-debated true authorship of the play, it has been suggested that it was a collaboration between Shakespeare and another playwright John Fletcher, though my knowledge on this is limited to reading the programme notes so I couldn’t possibly come down on one side or the other. Either way, there is much unevenness in this play and as a result it is only fitfully engaging. Acting-wise, there’s a veritable treasure trove of little delights in amongst the key performances: Miranda Raison’s butter-wouldn’t-melt Anne Bullen filled me with excitement for her star turn in Anne Boleyn later in the season; Anthony Howell’s arrogant Buckingham turning beautifully eloquent as he approaches his death and the scene-stealingly good Amanda Lawrence as a worldly-wise lady-in-waiting to Bullen and also doubling as Henry’s Fool (although I could have done without the freaky puppet). In the main roles, Kate Duchêne as the put-aside queen, Katherine of Aragon, is just fabulous and possessed of a wonderfully strong dignity. Full of pious rage that her God-given (as she sees it at least) situation is being challenged by mere men, she carefully reminds us that she is also a foreigner in a English court, feeling isolated in so many ways. Ian MacNeice is powerfully dominant as the coldly, calculating Wolsey, scything through anyone and everyone in order to sate his ambition and then dealing with his sudden fall with a graceful equanimity. As the titular Henry VIII, Dominic Rowan has a tough job in playing a character about whom there are so many preconceptions but also curiously here is rarely the focal point of the play. His morally ambivalent behaviour makes him difficult to warm to, the final rescue of Cranmer feels incongruous given the fates of most other people in the play and the rejoicing at the celebration of Princess Elizabeth’s christening feels wrong to the historian in me. In a play which revolves around people’s lives being horrendously affected through their contact with royalty, the King is never made to look bad, a clear nod to the reality of the time in which it was written and the need to maintain royal patronage, but unless I’m missing something, to me it felt too close to being hagiographic. It is played firmly in old school Tudor mode: costumes are wonderful, beautifully opulent and suitably courtly. The stage is mostly bare, with red carpet marking out around the edge of the stage the corridors where so much happens. Yardlings can rest assured there’s no tricksy canopy here as in Macbeth, but there is a mini thrust stage which projects into the yard and stairs around it on which I really wouldn’t put your bags, as the actors do use them quite a bit. It looks good but it does mean that too many of the scenes are static, constrained by the corridor trick, and so the lack of flexibility in the use of space means that if your view is restricted at the beginning of a scene, it will be restricted until the end of it, I would have preferred there to be more flowing scenes. And musically I was disappointed: I was not a fan of the over-enthusiastic drumming, the background music playing in many of the scenes with the ladies was annoying and interfered with the audibility of the generally very strong verse reading and the weird sound effect that kept popping up in the scene shifts was just odd."
1610,1610,Ought To Be Clowns,19/09/2012,Ian,Lost In Yonkers – Watford Palace,,"Neil Simon’s play Lost in Yonkers starts in August 1942 and after their mother dies of cancer and their father has to take on a job away from home to pay off the debts for her treatment, young teenagers Jay and Arty Kurnitz find themselves deposited at the door of their grandmother’s flat on top of a sweet shop in the city of Yonkers. But there’s no warm family embrace waiting for them, Grandma Kurnitz barely spoke to her son and initially doesn’t even want to take in her grandchildren. She finally relents and so the boys stay there for a year, learning a whole new set of life lessons as she rules the roost with the harshest rod of steel and they get reacquainted with the aunts and uncles they hardly know. Trapped with no chance of escape, the trials and tribulations of Jay and Arty are highly amusingly played by Jos Slovick and the playful Keith Ramsay, the misfortune of their situation more than tempered by their teenage concerns and constant mini-battles against the strictness of their new life regime. Some light relief comes in the form of the presence of their childlike Aunt Bella, their dodgy Uncle Louie and the later arrival of Aunt Gert complete with random speech impediment and the boys find themselves fitting into an entirely new family dynamic and one which their presence subtly changes. But behind the bluff humour and the comic strokes, there also lies a tragedy of almost Chekhovian proportions, the way in which the family has been affected by the complete closing-down of its matriarch – Laura Howard’s Bella epitomising this perfectly with what has to be considered one of the outstanding performances of the year. Her learning difficulties mean that people rarely take her seriously, especially in her fractured family, but every utterance is rooted in her own truth. From the backtracking from a faux pas about the boys’ mother to the incendiary statement of her lifelong intents as she finally gathers enough courage, Bella is utterly without guile and Howard breathes an incredible naturalism into her which is just heart-breakingly effective, especially as she still has to ask for someone to comfort her, even at her lowest point. Grandma Kurnitz’s own story is also powerfully emotive, the incredible harshness of her character seemingly inexplicable despite her history as a Jewish person in Germany, but Bernice Stegers makes a compelling case for the sheer conviction of belief in the path she has taken. And the way in which we discover how her children have variously assimilated her determination to ensure their survival at all costs ultimately becomes quite moving, the impact that persecution has upon those that escape, here given extra poignancy due to the Jewishness of the family but a message that resonates universally."
1611,1611,Ought To Be Clowns,24/05/2017,Ian,Twelfth Night, Shakespeare’s Globe,"Emma Rice’s Summer of Love got off to a slightly sticky start at the Globe with a mystifying take on Romeo and Juliet from Daniel Kramer and as we move onto Twelfth Night, which she is directing herself, there’s a similarly uncompromising attitude in place. For the production reminded me nothing so much as a camp episode of Monarch of the Glen (sadly not Monarch of the Glum) and whilst it is often fun to watch, it’s not always the most effective treatment. Rice’s iconoclastic approach is there from the get-go – a prologue set onboard the SS Unity before its shipwreck sees the company dancing merrily to Sister Sledge. And once in this decidedly Celtic Illyria, Orsino has a Lionel Richie mullet, Andrew Aguecheek is a would-be b-boy, serenades are played on cassette decks…why we’re in 1979, as good a time as any to explore cross-dressing hijinks of gender exploration.  Too often though, the play jibes against the interpretation or rather, it doesn’t seem to gain anything from the setting, especially when wafts of contemporary dance pop up out of nowhere. The text has been bluntly cut and laughs are generally externally imposed – Toby Belch quoting Gloria Gaynor for instance, or all the Scottish country dancing – and the language left neglected, lines like Aguecheek’s ‘I was adored once too’ scarcely milked for comedy or pathos, the emotion of the final reunion is marred by incidental music and staging that pulls away any intimacy. There are bright spots – Carly Bawden makes for a wonderfully determined Maria and her singing is full of character, Joshua Lacey’s archetypal 80s hunk of an Orsino is fun, and Tony Jayawardena and Marc Antolin connect well as Belch and Aguecheek, both delivering strong physical performances. But the sexuality of the piece is absent, Anita-Joy Uwajeh’s Cesario just feels too timid, neither convincing of love for Orsino or in rebuffing Annette McLaughlin’s muted Olivia. Perhaps I was spoiled by seeing the Royal Exchange’s superb version of the play last week which found all sorts of sexy and strange, raucous and romantic magic. Here, even the introduction of cabaret star Le Gateau Chocolat as Feste doesn’t explode with all the fabulousness it should, the character barely incorporated to the action of the play at all. Not even Katy Owen’s spirited take on Malvolio is safe, a misjudged attempt at real depth in the final seconds snatched away by an incoming jig. It is an undoubtedly bold production but also an uncomfortable fit; perhaps then the fitting epitaph for Rice’s artistic directorship."
1612,1612,Ought To Be Clowns,23/05/2014,mag9l,The Testament of Mary, Barbican,"This whole blogging malarkey can get a little bit wearing when small things like real life, the day job and editing another website get in the way of going to the theatre most every night and then writing about it. Thus the temptation to eschew a ‘proper’ review for something a bit less demanding and more fun to put together get a little stronger and in the cases when I’m not on official reviewing duty – I’m becoming more inclined to just go with it – example #1, example #2. "
1613,1613,Ought To Be Clowns,20/04/2008,Ian,His Dark Materials, Theatre Royal Bath Young People’s Theatre,"Ostensibly children’s literature, Pullman’s writing is so complex and multi-layered that it can be equally enjoyed by adults and in some of the questions it raises, which are admirably not shirked here, it really does posit strong opinions on the role of the Church in society amidst a range of issues dealt with such frankness and maturity that it really is recommended reading for anyone. Leah Elston-Thompson, Caitlin Lees-Massey and Bethany Hocken share the role of Lyra and Jonathan Chorley and Theo Boyce that of Will as they age from 12 to adulthood with excellent performances all-round. The way in which the transitions from actor to actor was handled was particularly beautiful, making what could have been awkward seamless and organic. But whilst the leads are impressive, it is the actors who cover the role of the daemons who end up capturing my heart the most. In Lyra’s world, each character has their own soul mate who takes the form of an animal who is portrayed by a puppet and manipulated by actors who have to straddle that line between puppeteering and actual acting and here, Joseph Reynolds as the kindly Pantalaimon and Huw Allen’s vicious Golden Monkey were both simply excellent. Given how much I loved the National’s production of these plays, this had a lot to live up to and I pleased to say that it really did match up well. Working with the strengths they had here in the enthusiasm of such a huge corps which allowed for effective scenes with additional witches and a very moving procession of souls towards the end, this was a highly affecting and astonishingly accomplished interpretation which also highlights the strength of the Young People’s Theatre’s company and who knows, some potential stars of the future."
1614,1614,Ought To Be Clowns,11/03/2012,Ian,Copenhagen, Lyceum,"Last year it was the turn of David Hare to get a retrospective season in Sheffield celebrating his work, but 2012 sees the Crucible et al honouring Michael Frayn. The Old Vic’s revival of his farce Noises Off has been an immense success in London, but Frayn is also known for his weightier fare and that is what this season is focusing on, featuring productions of Benefactors, Democracy, and Copenhagen – in a remarkably short run that I was lucky to make. The play is a three-hander that is centred around the 1941 real-life meeting between Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr and his wife at their home in Nazi-occupied Copenhagen. Both were scientists involved in the field of nuclear physics but the content of their meeting remains a mystery, though the implication is that Heisenberg’s development of nuclear weapons for the Nazi regime may have been high on the agenda. Frayn expands and expounds on this in the most esoteric and complex of ways, folding in huge issues of philosophy, morality, history, memory, love and quantum physics. The characters meet in the afterlife, and each recount the meeting in a slightly different way, discussing and debating all the while and freewheeling in a non-linear structure to top things off. But in a similiar way to Stoppard in Arcadia, Frayn has a real gift for wrapping these complex topics in a most accessible form. Here the character of Margrethe, Bohr’s wife, is used as a bridge between the scientists and the audience, ensuring that we get a layman’s explanation and thus have a chance at beginning to understand just what is going on. That’s not to say that it is made easy. This is hard-going from the outset, layers upon layers of dense talk and huge amounts of knowledge and research imparted. And its form is often also challenging too, as it repeatedly shifts from past to present, first person to third, breaking the fourth wall and more, with lightning speed. It is testament to the skill of the actors, Henry Goodman as Bohr, Geoffrey Streatfeild as Heisenberg and Barbara Flynn as Margrethe, that they can even cope with this, never mind make it appealing to watch. I love Barbara Flynn’s natural grace and her easy persona here is brilliant and Streatfeild’s angst-ridden intensity fits in well against the more mature, though still tortured, Goodman."
1615,1615,Ought To Be Clowns,24/01/2011,Ian,Far From The Madding Crowd, ETT via Digital Theatre,"A couple of weeks ago, Digital Theatre ran a January sale promotion which meant that you could get their plays for well under a fiver, which reminded me I had previously downloaded English Touring Theatre’s production of Thomas Hardy’s Far From The Madding Crowd but never quite got round to watching it. I’ve previously reviewed The Comedy Of Errors which was highly enjoyable and so I thought Digital Theatre was worth another try, especially since I’d paid for this one! This particular production was recorded at Guildford’s Yvonne Arnaud theatre on November 15th 2008 Having inherited her father’s farm, a spirited and feisty young woman – Bathsheba Everdene, finds herself playing mistress in a man’s world as she is determined to do things her way and her impetuous nature sometimes gets the better of her. She is pursued by three would-be lovers: the constant shepherd, Gabriel Oak; the obsessive landowner, William Boldwood and the reckless Sergeant Troy and as this is Hardy, real tragedy is never far round the corner. As the central Bathsheba, Rebecca O’Mara was really rather good, though I think I probably sympathised with her more as she succumbed to the attentions of a hunk in uniform! Laura Elphinstone provided sterling support as her friend Liddy. And as her suitors, Adam Croasdell made a smoulderingly dashing Sergeant Troy, Stephen Billington brought a great stern quality and pulled off some mightily impressive sideburns as neighbouring farmer William Boldwood but it is Phil Cheadle’s quietly dependable Gabriel Oak who really impresses, bringing a wry humour and subtly suggesting the deep passions that lie beneath his impassive demeanour. It was quite good fun to watch but I am not 100% convinced of how successful a transfer it was from stage to film. It was evidently well-staged in having some scenes run concurrently on different sides of the stage, sometimes allowing starts and finishes to bleed into each other and also using multiple levels which injected a great deal of pace into the story, making it an unexpectedly strong adaptation. But the way in which it has been filmed, with endless cross-fades and very quick transitions, meant that it was sometimes confusing and one was often left wishing that the wider picture could be seen, embracing the stage as a whole rather than constantly cutting from one side to the other. I suppose at the heart of this lies the dilemma in filming live theatre, are you trying to recreate the experience of sitting in a theatre and watching the action in front of you or are you trying to create a new piece of art. The filming of David Tennant’s Hamlet was probably the most effective recent version of the latter for me, but this falls somewhere uncomfortably in the middle, managing neither one wholly successfully. The edits at the beginning are proficiently executed but the use of overhead cameras to bring a new perspective added nothing for me and too often I felt the desire to do something ‘interesting’ with the edit actually detracted from the production, I don’t think we got to see the entirety of a single one of the choreographed routines in its simplicity. Even something as basic as the considerable noise coming from the actors clumping around on the wooden set just made it feel like an ill-thought through enterprise."
1616,1616,Ought To Be Clowns,02/10/2013,Ian,The Empty Quarter, Hampstead Downstairs,"Alexandra Wood’s The Empty Quarter may find itself the victim of slightly unfortunate timing – a play about tough working conditions in the oil-rich Gulf States would lead many, who have seen recent headlines, to thoughts of the horrendous plight of migrant workers in Qatar. That the play is actually about a much higher grade of worker in Dubai, housed in palatial flats and raking in a healthy tax-free income, may initially throw you, but the story it tells of the strictures of life on the Arabian Peninsula has its own compelling drama. From the outset, it is clear that mid-twenties couple Greg and Holly haven’t quite taken to Dubai like the proverbial duck to water. What seemed attractive in the brochures seems unreal and hollow in the flesh, the comparative social isolation is particularly hard for Holly who isn’t working and an ill-advised jaunt into the desert resulted in something like second-degree burns. But when Greg takes matters into his own hands and quits his job, they discover that the rules are entirely different out here and that they’re in for the long haul whether they like it or not. Wood’s play hits on a shocking reality about taking on these kinds of contracts and it is enough to give pause to anyone thinking of doing the same. But she also delves into the more universally applicable truths about the challenges of emigration and how it plays out differently in a couple. Gunnar Cauthery’s Greg is constantly on edge, trying to do the right thing yet struggling with missing his life back home, whereas Jodie McNee’s Holly is just struggling, cut adrift and thrust into a world of nothing but exercise classes and shopping.  The star performance comes from Geraldine Alexander though, as Gemma the wife of Greg’s boss. A resident of Dubai for nearly 25 years, she’s watched countless colleagues come and go on the short contracts that tempt them out in the first place, desperately trying to make friends with their wives in the meantime and not always succeeding. Her brittle, busybody demeanour is a whirlwind of activity, her constant presence a bugbear for Greg and Holly yet Alexander roots her in total honesty, demanding our empathy if not our sympathy for the life she has been party to for so long."
1617,1617,Ought To Be Clowns,31/03/2019,Ian,Cry Havoc, Park Theatre,"I wanted to love Cry Havoc but it didn’t quite do it for me. Set in present-day Cairo, Egyptian Mohammed is being comforted by his lover Nicholas, a British academic after being imprisoned and tortured by the authorities for his sexuality. Their relationship is of course a secret but as Mohammed’s family and community turn against him, Nick is determined to ‘save’ him. But it isn’t just as simple as upping sticks to the UK and playwright Tom Coash attempts to portray the worlds of difference between gay life in these two spheres. Nick is the embodiment of Western liberalism and Mohammed is the firebrand revolutionary who wants to provoke change from within. With such a cultural divide between them, does love stand a chance?  It’s a powerfully emotive subject and with James El-Sharawy and Marc Antolin, Pamela Schermann’s production finds a compelling pair of lead performances. But the writing really doesn’t come up to scratch to give them the depth of character to make them credible as people with actual human emotion. Too often they’re lumbered with positions to argue rather than passions to feel. "
1618,1618,Ought To Be Clowns,22/06/2015,mag9l,Luna Gale, Hampstead,"There’s a moment towards the end of Rebecca Gilman’s 2014 play Luna Gale, directed by Michael Attenborough at the Hampstead, that is just breath-taking. Put-upon social worker Caroline finds herself pressured into praying in her office with a visiting pastor and her religious boss and as the minister lays his hand on her shoulder and offers a deeply seductive account of God’s love, Sharon Small’s deeply conflicted Caroline seems to teeter on the edge of something monumental in an extraordinarily charged moment of drama. I’d describe it as a shocking moment but that reveals my own prejudices, a distrust of fundamentalist-tinged religion and a sense that such movements prey on easy targets, but in turn that reflects a larger point that Gilman makes in her play. Caroline is dealing with the case of 2 year old Luna Gale, born to teenage meth addicts and though rehousing the child with her grandmother seems the easy option, when she reveals she is deeply religious during a case meeting, Caroline’s instinctive reaction is to roll her eyes and offer a dry remark. An Iowa-based social worker of 25 years’ experience and most of those horrendously overworked, she’s developed a shorthand for dealing with the vast number of cases she has to deal with, all featuring vulnerable children in desperate need of care. But what seems like common sense, the following of her gut feelings, isn’t always within the rules and with a state-appointed manager overseeing all the cases in the office due to a colleague’s meltdown and government cuts laying waste to support mechanisms, Caroline finds herself having to tread carefully indeed to ensure the best resolution for Luna, as she sees it.  And that’s where Gilman’s play is strongest, in the compassionate obduracy of a 50-something woman determined to do the right thing but unable to see that she’s not always making the right decisions. Small is excellent in showing these flaws, the quick move to judgement – as much as necessity as short-cut when she’s dealing with 90+ cases simultaneously – but never letting us fail to see how deeply, how painfully she feels. We also see her dealing with another case of an older girl transitioning out of foster care into college, a counterpointing experience but ultimately no less entangled. "
1619,1619,Ought To Be Clowns,22/09/2013,Ian,Secret Theatre Show 1 and Secret Theatre Show 2, Lyric Hammersmith,"How long can you keep a secret? How long should you keep a secret? As it turns out, critics were tweeting the title of the Lyric Hammersmith’s ‘Secret Theatre Show 2’ as soon as they could get their phones on in the interval, unleashing a flurry of outraged blogs and tweets which argued both sides of the toss – it was either like Christmas being ruined or one of the least important parts of the whole experience. That experience is Secret Theatre, an ambitious 8 month programme launched by the Lyric’s Sean Holmes which has pulled together an ensemble of 20 creatives who will produce 7 shows over the period. But the key is that the titles are kept from us, no programmes are for sale on arrival and so technically you take your place in the auditorium, which is mid-renovation, not knowing what the curtain will rise upon. A quick scoot around the internet will reveal the titles of Secret Theatre Show 1 and Secret Theatre Show 2 which have now opened but in the spirit of the whole affair – after all as we leave, we are urged “Shhh. Keep the secret…” – this review won’t spill the beans too much. We live in a spoiler-saturated society now when it comes to much of our popular culture and so whilst it may not be to everyone’s taste, the unique thrill of knowing nothing in advance is one to savour. It also leads to the intriguing question of when recognition of what play is being performed will come, indeed if at all for it could be a piece of new writing, experienced theatregoers should be fine but new audiences have the opportunity to possibly experience some of the greatest writing of last century as if it were a brand new play and that is what is genuinely exciting about this enterprise. Having seen both Show 1 and Show 2 now, it is fascinating to see how the ensemble has been working together, under Holmes’ direction, to create a defined aesthetic for this company. Hyemi Shin’s designs focus on stripped back space and high clean lines, early indications are that food will play an important part as props, and the maintenance of the diverse natural accents of the cast provides a welcome shot in the arm, clearly marking realism as the enemy and establishing the vivid theatricality with which these plays will be approached. It’s a bold approach and one with variable returns here, and it will be interesting to see if this is an aesthetic that they pursue across the season or whether they will continue to innovate and surprise – I rather hope it will be the latter. A few details to help govern your choice if you’re undecided about taking the risk yet don’t want to know too much. Show 1 is much the shorter, a new version of a classic which has been partly devised by the company too and which is a raucous reinvention of animal onesies, PJ Harvey on the soundtrack and some nifty gender-swapping – Billy Seymour and Katherine Pearce do strong work but the hugely exciting Charlotte Josephine is the stand-out here. The source material suits the symbolic imagination that suffuses this production but it is full of concepts and imagery that isn’t always fully realised. "
1620,1620,Ought To Be Clowns,20/07/2015,mag9l,I Love You, You’re Perfect,"Just a quickie for this, a late-hours performance late in the run in a vilely hot tiny auditorium perched atop no-one’s favourite West End theatre. I hadn’t been Above the Arts before and I remain unconvinced that it is an essential addition to our theatres, especially in this heat. Fortunately, Kirk Jameson’s production of Jimmy Roberts and Joe DiPietro’s off-Broadway stalwart I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change was good enough to almost take my mind off it. With old Avenue Q friends Julie Atherton and Simon Lipkin joined by Gina Beck and Samuel Holmes, this is about as good as musical theatre casting gets, especially for a fringe production and the quality of this quartet smoothed over most of the weaknesses of the show. A revue-ish song cycle type of thing, it whips through a set of loosely connected vignettes about the various trials and tribulations between a man and a woman. And it really is paper thin material, it is to cast and creatives’ collective credit that it becomes such a good showcase for their considerable skills. Atherton’s comic charm is beautifully served here, so too her soulfully expressive eyes; Beck’s powerful presence nails ‘Always A Bridesmaid’ plus her Jewish widow picking up men at funerals ain’t too shabby either; Holmes hits a home run with his nerdish set of guys; and Lipkin – swoon – remains an unpredictable delight, thoroughly watchable whatever he does."
1621,1621,Ought To Be Clowns,08/02/2018,Ian,Think of England, VAULT Festival,"It’s 1942 and Bette and Vera have scored themselves a nice commission from the War Office to tour the country hosting tea dances to boost morale of the brave men and boys fighting the Nazis. But whilst they’re hanging the bunting and handing out barley sweets, it emerges that there’s more on offer here than just dance cards and as a group of three war-weary Canadian airmen turn up for the night, unexpected emotions threaten to bubble over. Madeline Gould’s Think of England is beautifully written and in its opening two-thirds has an absolutely gorgeous feel to it. Tilly Branson’s production has a lightly immersive nature (don’t sit on the front row if you’re shy…) which sees us as active participants sequestered in this air raid shelter with the cast. And as we’re introduced to the cast, there’s a sensitive exploration of the massive impact of the war on a personal level – the relative freedom afforded to the women who can now work, the abject terror faced by boys tasked with the enormity of fighting an actual war when they’re scarcely adults.  
None of the flirtatious nature of the evening is shirked either, as the comfort offered by close companionship in times of such danger becomes palpable right in front of our eyes. Indeed, there’s even a dance lesson midway through to instruct those willing in the seductive ways of the jive. But though much has changed in these pressured times, some things remain sadly the same as the play takes a darker turn in its final act as scandal is threatened, sexual hypocrisies exposed, the boundaries of society revealed to not have advanced that far after all. Gould and Leila Sykes are a vivacious pair as Vera and Bette, so warm and inviting as genial hosts and bracing in their emotional honesty and vulnerability respectively.  And they’re matched with strong work from Matthew Biddulph, Pip Brignall and a beautifully nuanced Stefan Menaul as the transatlantic visitors who have each reacted to their wartime duty in significantly different ways, resulting in the tinderbox of tension that emerges here. I could have perhaps lost ten minutes from the final section to keep its intensity at its fiercest but this is impressive work from Anonymous is a Woman and a highlight of the VAULT so far for me. Running time: 1 hour 45 minutes (without interval)

1622,1622,Ought To Be Clowns,01/06/2017,Ian,Ordinary Days, London Theatre Workshop,"I saw Adam Gwon’s 2008 musical Ordinary Days downstairs at the Trafalgar Studios back in 2011 with a grand cast that included Julie Atherton, Alexia Khadime and Daniel Boys and enjoyed it a fair bit, so news of a new production by Streetlights, People! at the transplanted London Theatre Workshop (now in the City) was glad tidings indeed. Directed by Jen Coles on the simplest of sets, decorated with a Manhattan skyline by Samantha Cates, the show’s relatable charms shine through once again. The four-hander is a deceptively simple show – a quartet of 20-something New Yorkers are spiritually lost, swept up in what should be the romance of the city but finding that adulting isn’t quite as easy as all that. Jason is sacrificing everything for the woman he loves but Claire’s previously broken heart just won’t heal properly; grad student Deb has lost months of valuable thesis research but when struggling artist Warren finds it, she stubbornly resists any attempt at connection that he makes. So far so rom-com but Gwon’s trick is to spike his narratives with a quirkily idiosyncratic dose of real life. So the meet-cute at the Met is ruined by Deb’s dislike for art galleries and her generally caustic manner, vividly encapsulated in Nora Perone’s delightfully scornful performance. And something more moving thus comes out of the slow-burning friendship that emerges with Neil Cameron’s appealingly nerdish Warren, acknowledging that it can be that much harder to make friends in a city and that it can be worthwhile. Set against them, Claire and Jason’s relationship drama is a little more bittersweet as doubt creeps into their happiness, Kirby Hughes (so good that she gave me goosebumps within 10 seconds of starting to sing) and Alistair Frederick both sparkling as they each figure out exactly what it is they’re fighting for. Director Coles keeps the action moving pacily around the space, evoking something of the claustrophobic unfriendliness of metropolitan hustle and bustle and musical director Rowland Braché leads intelligently from the piano. "

1624,1624,Ought To Be Clowns,15/08/2013,Ian,A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Broadway Studios,"Tucked away down the narrowest of alleyways on Tooting High Street is one of the most boisterous Shakespearean adaptations you could hope for, full of your mom jokes, nipple tweaks, disco dancing, handcuffs and Googlemaps. Tooting Arts Club’s production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, performed here by a most hard-working ensemble of 8, is also full of great humour and accessible warmth, director Bill Buckhurst modernising and revitalising this lightest of comedies into something quirkily adorable. Buckhurst has made some great choices. Having the quartet of lovers as teenage schoolkids makes good sense of their headlong rush into the forest and the fierce intensity of their burning loins, and making the fairies a bunch of slightly past-it club kids having a bad comedown and merely toying with the intruders into their domain is inspired. Titania’s blissed-out idolatry of Bottom suddenly becomes recognisable as any bad choice one might have made on the dancefloor; Puck’s hyperactive 1000 watt personality just like ‘that guy’ you meet and find impossible to shake off. And it is under the enchantment that the production delivers its finest moment, in one of the funniest versions of the lovers’ fight that you could ever hope to see. The petty squabbling between Waleed Akhtar’s Lysander and Declan Perring’s Demetrius over Racheal Ofori’s mystified Helena is a joy to behold, but it is with the introduction of the fiercely scrapping Hermia, Kathryn Perkins with a delightful lack of abandon, that elevates it into an excellent piece of physical comedy. The ducal court scenes don’t have quite the same effect, not quite fitting into this interpretation so easily, Hippolyta and Theseus’ relationship is frustratingly vague, but the Rude Mechanicals are huge amounts of fun. Waleed Elgadi (also Theseus and Oberon) is best as Peter Quince, a divine if precious director, Christopher Knott’s Bottom is a bumptious delight and if the performance of Pyramus and Thisbe isn’t quite as funny as one might hope, it is only because the prologue that comes before is simply hilarious."
1625,1625,Ought To Be Clowns,05/05/2013,Ian,The Ghost Hunter, Old Red Lion,"Theatre of the Damned’s self-avowed undertaking is to explore horror and suspense on stage, a challenging mission as demonstrated by last year’s The Horror! The Horror! which only fitfully worked for me but one worth pursuing as this expanded version of The Ghost Hunter, written by Stewart Pringle, proves to be a highly proficient foray into the realm of suspense. And taking over the Old Red Lion theatre pub in Angel, it transforms the space most effectively.  Alice Saville’s design is simplicity itself, but it shouldn’t be under-estimated how effective stripping the walls of the intimate theatre right back to black, with just a strip of frayed pub carpet up centre on which a table and chair sit, pint of Abbot Ale pride of place. And from these well-worn surroundings, Tom Richards’ Victorian-garbed raconteur Richard Barraclough quickly pulls us into the world of York’s twisting narrow streets like the Shambles and regales us with tales of pale abandoned orphans and other spooky goings-on. But Pringle soon confounds expectations as it turns out we’re in a world of cod-Victoriana, Barraclough is actually a modern-day ghost tour conductor and what ensues over this 60-minute monologue is less of a ghost story itself but rather an exploration of how and why ghost tourism has sprung up in places like York and on a more intimate level, why we like to tell ghost stories so much. So whether you’re a believer or not in things that go bump in the night, it’s a thoroughly enthralling piece of drama. "
1626,1626,Ought To Be Clowns,16/04/2018,Ian,Instructions for Correct Assembly, Royal Court,"Instructions for Thomas Eccleshare’s Instructions for Correct Assembly Step 1 Take a Verity Bargate Award-winning (for Pastoral) playwright and give him his Royal Court debut with a gently futuristic play about families and failures and robot surrogates. Step 2 Find a director with real previous in quirky stagings at the Royal Court (Goats, Who Cares, Teh Internet is Serious Business) and a designer up for the challenge of maintaining the ingenious and striking look of current main house productions with its middle-class modernity. Step 3 Up the ante by introducing illusionist Paul Kieve into the mix to put together some properly mind-boggling trickery and have a crack stage management team under Kate Aisling Jones’ leadership support actor Brian Vernel in accomplishing said illusions. Step 4 Pull together a top-notch cast including the always good Mark Bonnar (returning to the stage after six years) and the wonderful Jane Horrocks.
  And the result is something that is really quite intriguing, if ultimately a little thin on the thematic areas it covers. The aesthetic is stunning – Cai Dyfan’s design, under the boldness and intricacy of Jack Knowles’ lighting, is a study in the complexity of human nature, the layers that can be peeled back, the images we wish to project to the outside world. Eccleshare probes at something interesting too, in the way he presents Harry and Max, the parents who react to the death of their drug-addicted son by ordering a robot fascimile that they can, they hope, program into the ideal replacement. Things inevitably don’t go to plan but you can’t help but wish we had more detail to flesh out these people. But maybe that’s the point. Vicki Manderson’s movement is used in scene changes to suggest that there’s something robotic about society as a whole, a glitch in the programming that means that this lack of humanity is systemic. The result may be that we’re not as moved as we feel we ought to be, though there’s much dark wit here, but maybe we’re the problem.  "
1627,1627,Ought To Be Clowns,19/07/2014,mag9l,Amadeus, Chichester Festival Theatre,"Whilst the mere mention of Amadeus, for most people, will instantly call to mind something like  so it is hard not to be just a little disappointed that the late lamented Falco doesn’t make an appearance somewhere in Jonathan Church’s production of Peter Shaffer’s play Amadeus at the newly renovated Chichester Festival Theatre. Instead, it is a more prosaic look at life in the eighteenth century Viennese court where resident composer Antonio Salieri has his nose well and truly put out of joint by the arrival of a young upstart by the name of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is told in flashback through the eyes of the embittered Salieri and it is here that the play is instantly hobbled. I rather like Rupert Everett but his monotonous delivery of the substantial amount of narration means that there’s no variation to the character at all – villain or no, he’s still allowed to be interested but instead he’s chained to an immutable interpretation here that stultifies much of the production."
1628,1628,Ought To Be Clowns,11/05/2016,mag9l,DiaoChan – The Rise of the Courtesan, Above the Arts,"DiaoChan – The Rise of the Courtesan offers a rare opportunity for London audiences to delve into Chinese classic theatre, with Ross Ericson’s free adaptation coming from part of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature and among the oldest novels in the world. So it aims to be an epic piece of storytelling but this Red Dragonfly/Grist To The Mill production, also directed by Ericson, actually works best in its more human, intimate moments. As the Han Dynasty comes to a violent end, ambitious general DongZhuo seizes power in 189AD by installing a mere boy on the imperial throne and rules by default as chancellor, protected by his adopted son, the great warrior LüBu. Among the few who oppose him is the government minister WangYun but it takes the enterprising nous of a singing girl in his household named Diaochan to come up with a plot to defeat their enemies and simultaneously secure her rising position in society, breaking out of the usual limited historical roles for women of courtesan and concubine. And Michelle Yim as DiaoChan gives us a charismatic leading performance, full of wry wit and skilful observation at how best to advance her position. This she does by tying her would-be suitors into knots with their own words, whether the handsome but verbally lumbering LüBu (a lovely turn from Arthur Lee) or the older, sharper but too easily manipulated DongZhou (a nicely long-suffering Angelo Paragoso). And the unexpected twist of Siu-see Hung as DongZhou’s mother is initially disarming but ultimately successful in heightening the domestic tragedy. But there’s an unevenness to the rest of the production that doesn’t always support this central trio. Ericson infuses a nice deal of humour and bawdiness into his storytelling but is less successful when he strains for poetic resonance in sporadic ventures into verse and soliloquys, the set design of movable screens is well-conceived but less well executed (good costumes though), and the performance level isn’t always consistent, which given the small cast and the amount of Machiavellian double-dealing going on is pretty much necessary.  That said, DiaoChan – The Rise of the Courtesan is still a fascinating look into an underexplored (in this country at least) tradition of storytelling and a welcome boost to the British East-Asian theatre scene."
1629,1629,Ought To Be Clowns,12/10/2010,Ian,Enlightenment, Hampstead Theatre,"    This was very attractively designed, as you say, but I found the play frustrating on many levels. Lia's constant guilt-and-granola monologues made it difficult to connect with her as a mother trying to cope with not knowing whether her son was alive or dead, and the play as whole was neither particularly emotionally or intellectually satisfying.  There are some very interesting things later on in the season though. Yes, too intellectual rather than emotional, but achieving neither one really. The season does look interesting, but I do wonder about the number of writers directing their own plays. Love the idea of their studio though. Has there been a big increase in smoking on stage? Seems like it or maybe it's more prominent by the lack of smoking elsewhere."
1630,1630,Ought To Be Clowns,25/10/2009,Ian,The Turn Of The Screw, Coliseum,"Britten’s opera, The Turn of the Screw, is based on the novella by Henry James and is about an idealistic but inexperienced governess sent to care for two children, Flora and Miles, at an English estate. Returning to the Coliseum for six performances after a successful 2007 run, this production maintains three of its original cast, and a conductor, Sir Charles Mackerras, who last conducted this opera in 1956! Essentially, this is a Victorian ghost story, albeit one which much ambiguity and the suggestion of a harrowing past of child abuse. At first, the governess is charmed by her charges and comforted by the companionability of the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose. Soon, however, ominous things begin to happen, and the governess encounters what seem to be the ghosts of two former employees: the last governess Mrs. Jessel and Peter Quint the former master’s valet. There is a hint that something unsavory happened between the children and these domestics, but this has not ended, despite their deaths, leading the current governess to pursue the truth, regardless of the consequences. Britten’s spooky score was performed with diamond precision by the chamber orchestra, the air of tension never far away, and a number of excellent solos were impressive. Rebecca Evans as the governess was superb, her voice being equally strong no matter where on the register she wa singing, and she brought real emotion to her every word. Elsewhere, I was particularly fond of Ann Murray’s Mrs Grose, her starched performance perfectly suiting the role of the disbelieving housekeeper. And Nazan Fikret and Charlie Manton as the two children more than held their own against these seasoned professionals, and I have to mention Manton’s extremely impressive piano playing miming which from my seat looked extremely convincing. The staging is very sparse, brilliantly evocative of a Victorian horror story from the start (never has a rocking-horse seemed so creepy) and transitions between scenes were excellently executed by a number of a silent maids and butlers and an ingenious system of a series of sliding panels which never seemed intrusive. The lighting was also particlarly effective in creating the requisite haunted mood of this archetypal English stately home and in creating a real sense of intimacy on a massive stage."
1631,1631,Ought To Be Clowns,24/10/2014,Ian,Uncle Vanya, St James,"Proving herself once, twice, three times a lady Chekhov adapter, Anya Reiss now finds herself in the slightly odd position where (I think) she’s had more of her adaptations produced than her original writing – it’s certainly one way of casting off the mantle of ‘saviour of new writing’ with which she has often been blessed/cursed. I didn’t catch her well-received take on Spring Awakening for Headlong earlier this year but it is reimagining the work of Chekhov that has really fired her mojo – recent versions of The Seagull and Three Sisters are now followed by an equally modern Uncle Vanya for the St James Theatre. And whilst I’d love to say these adaptation are going from strength to strength, for me it is much more a case of diminishing returns. Moving The Seagull to a contemporary Isle of Man chimed well but Three Sisters suffered a little (well, a lot) in the shift to a modern British embassy and so too does Uncle Vanya here, relocated to a Lincolnshire farm in the modern day. The sense of crippling stagnation, of an entire way of life on the precipice is present but none of the deep emotion or eternal tragedy of the characters that should elevate its concerns to the universal. Russell Bolam’s production is partly at fault here – a baffling array of regional accents (of varying quality) pepper the farm which given that this group are bound either by family or the land just doesn’t work, what earthly reason does Amanda Boxer’s Marina have for being from Somerset (at least I think she was…) aside from er, COMEDYRURALACCENT!!! Throw in an opening half that is overly static, some ‘hilarious’ drunk acting and a raft of modern references to iPads, farmers markets and diazepam and it all just sits on the stage rather than genuinely living."
1632,1632,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2010,Ian,Serenading Louie, Donmar Warehouse,"Serenading Louie by American writer Lanford Wilson is the latest play to hit the Donmar Warehouse. Set in 1970s Chicago, it’s a tale of two college friends who are now in their 30s, struggling to maintain their dreams in the face of marriages and jobs that haven’t necessarily lived up to their expectations. As one would expect from the Donmar, the acting is first-rate. I particularly loved Geraldine Somerville’s sparky Mary, possessed of the best lines in the show (careful if you attend a dinner party with her!) the most poignant of all being the one at the top of the review, the delivery of which is almost worth the entry price alone. And Jason O’Mara as her husband Alex was a minefield of emotion just bubbling under in a tightly restrained performance which also impressed. Jason Butler Harner and Charlotte Emerson have less interesting (and more annoying) parts but both did well. But despite the best efforts of the actors, I just didn’t like the play. The initially interesting set-up of both couples’ homes being played in the same room soon wore thin, even with the very effective lighting around the edge of the stage. And once the tense atmospheres of the two relationships had been set up in the opening, admittedly very effective, scenes, we seemed to flounder. An overlong scene between the two guys sapped the energy and the women weren’t given an equivalent scene which seemed very uncharitable of the playwright. In lieu of much actually happening in the play, it is full of dramatic tricks. There’s overlapping dialogue, there’s scenes where characters talk despite not really being there and one of the recurring themes of the year reared its ugly head again, characters talking to the audience (the other one, male nudity, was not represented here although O’Hara does appear briefly in his boxers). All of these things annoyed me. The set, although well dressed and pleasingly authentic looking, is oddly designed in that it finishes at the height of the stalls, so that even in the intimate space of the Donmar, sitting in the circle leaves you feeling quite isolated from the action. The fact that I was most excited by the lemon juice in a squeezy plastic lemon is rather telling, it also tells you who does the shopping in my house as I thought they’d long since disappeared but apparently you can still get them. For me, Serenading Louie is all just a bit ‘so what’, emotional paralysis alone is not enough to sustain a play…one to avoid I think. Harner often crafts annoying and underwhelming performances on this side of the pond as well, but this play would be a tough sell anywhere."
1633,1633,Ought To Be Clowns,05/03/2018,Ian,The Best Man, Playhouse,"With American politics being the shitshow that it currently is, the temptation to lampoon Trump at every and any opportunity is one that many theatre directors have been unable to resist. A wilier creative mind might regard this as too on the nose (and already overdone) and find an alternative way to critique our transatlantic cousins, at least an avalanche of Brexit plays puts the boot on the other foot. And that is what Simon Evans’ revival of Gore Vidal’s 1960 play The Best Man has done. After touring the UK last year, it arrives at the Playhouse Theatre with a slight sense of stateliness about it but also alive to how just how much of what was written nearly 60 years ago has to say about today’s political establishment. With a cast that includes Martin Sheen and Maureen Lipman, plus a cracking performance from Philip Cumbus, there’s something interesting here that rises above some slightly dated writing and aspects of a political system long left behind. The play circles around a battle to secure the Democratic Party presidential nomination. On the one hand there’s a party loyalist complete with government experience and on the other, there’s an up-and-coming senator riding a wave of populist support. And in a Philadelphia hotel ahead of a key convention, they each fight to gain the upper hand and the approval of former President Hockstader (a lively turn from Jack Shepherd) who has positioned himself as kingmaker. Shaw is his customary smooth self as William Russell, an intellectual with a past and Jeff Fahey is lots of fun as his rival Joseph Cantwell, a hothead who also (possibly) has a past. And it is interesting to note the common threads about how to spin a ‘good’ politician – regular Joe-ness over cleverness, wives pretty enough to take a good picture but who will never steal focus, pressing the flesh with exactly the right kind of pressure groups (thankfully there’s no NRA here…). In the elegant surroundings of designer Michael Taylor’s hotel suite, the gamesmanship we get to witness proves engaging, especially as we edge closer to dirty tricks and straight-up corruption. Maureen Lipman’s elder stateswoman is a dry delight as she dictates what she – and by extension the women of the USA – will accept. Phil Cumbus’ gives good Dick as wheeler-dealing campaign manager Dick Jensen."
1634,1634,Ought To Be Clowns,09/10/2016,mag9l,Confessional, Southwark Playhouse,"I can’t deny it, when I first heard the staging for Tennessee Williams’ Confessional was ‘semi-immersive’, I rolled my eyes for it has become a much-abused term by arts marketeers. But on arriving at Southwark Playhouse, being encouraged to go into the Little straightaway and thus experiencing Justin Williams’ design, I was blown away. For the theatre has been transformed into a working bar, Monk’s Place, complete with pork scratchings and the kind of seating found in any traditional pub. The pre-show entertainment sets the mood perfectly, actors milling round making the kind of small talk you might call banter, for that is so much of the essence of the play. Eschewing conventional dramatic structure, Confessional is less about plot than about people. Specifically, the punters of this seaside boozer as they count down the minutes to closing time, sharing stories with us, arguing the toss with each other, trying – and failing – to come to terms with the cards life has dealt them. Jack Silver’s production for Tramp transplants the play wholesale to contemporary Southend-on-Sea and though some are wary of ever changing Williams’ original context (qv the recent A Streetcar Named Desire), it can sometimes seem counter-productive to impose too much literalism on his writing. For its poetry and symbolism can be timeless when allowed, the existential angst of these characters all the more affecting when not tethered to too much extraneous detail, whether in 1950s SoCal or 2010s SoS.  For me, this is most evident in Lizzie Stanton’s blistering performance as Leona (a mobile home-dwelling beautician, there’s those details…) whose elemental rage is as close to a central figure as we get. Mourning the anniversary of the death of her brother, picking fights with all and sundry, hers is a fierce flame that dares you to look away as she prowls the bar. Gavin Brocker’s cocky Bill and Rob Ostlere’s sly Steve also stand out, as does the melancholy of landlord Monk, a beautifully understated Raymond Bethley."
1635,1635,Ought To Be Clowns,20/01/2012,Ian,The Trial of Ubu, Hampstead,"One always knows that when Katie Mitchell’s name appears in connection with a play, then it is bound to be something just a little bit different as she has proved herself to be one of our most original, and consequently divisive, directors. Her latest foray into the theatre is with Simon Stephens’ satirical new play The Trial of Ubu which is just starting at the Hampstead Theatre. Mitchell has recently collaborated with both: Stephens’ play Wastwater left me more than a little bemused at the Royal Court but her installation piece small hours which played as part of the Hampstead Downstairs season last year was quietly, disturbingly excellent. The Trial of Ubu is quite something else though. Dark, disconcerting and challenging, it really is unlike anything else in London at the moment. I saw it without knowing anything about it, or indeed about the play itself to be honest, aside from having a vague recollection of having heard a mention of Père Ubu once upon a time. And it is obviously up to you how forewarned you want to be about the show, just be aware that what will follow will necessarily contain a few spoilers. Things start off rather randomly with a puppet show, think Punch and Judy crossed with Spitting Image, which presents as grotesque farce, the nefarious violent doings of King Ubu during his bloody rise to power and torrid reign which is actually a new version of Alfred Jarry’s absurdist work Ubu Roi by Stephens. A section of the stage wall then opens up and two interpreters take their seat at the ringside of the International Criminal Tribune in The Hague at the trial of a brutal dictator who stands accused of crimes against humanity and multiple violations of international humanitarian law. That dictator is Ubu, Stephens having taken the fictional character and placed him in a modern-day context to draw strong, if non-specific parallels with the likes of Slobodan Milošević and Charles Taylor who both faced trial for genocide. In a bold stroke, we don’t witness Ubu’s trial directly, but rather experience it through these two interpreters who are stretched to the limit as the court is in the Netherlands, the defendant speaks Russian, defence counsel speaks French and the prosecutor is German. And by removing ‘character’ from the equation as these two women translate all the dialogue from their poky little room, the unflinching emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of international law and questions the legitimacy that it actually possesses, especially outwith the cultural specificity where the crime was committed. We also get to see the increasingly traumatic impact of the trial and its subject matter on the interpreters – played skilfully by Kate Duchêne and Nikki Amuka-Bird (a late replacement for Hattie Morahan) – as the case drags on and how their mutually dependent relationship develops whilst they continue to capture neutrally every nuance from every language. They’re both extremely good, dealing well with the huge challenge of verbosity, but Duchêne is genuinely outstanding – her wordless breakdown near the end, almost hidden from view, is just heartbreaking These scenes are alleviated by brief interludes in which we see opposing counsel debate the merits of their legal battling, and also Ubu and his jailer in snippets of conversation. The latter of these is the most disturbing as Paul McLeary’s dictator, for so long unseen, is most disconcerting to look at, the most obvious visual cue being Heath Ledger’s Joker. This effectively calls back to the puppet show of the beginning but also heightens the comic tragedy of self-aggrandising rulers, so often tolerated by the international community until it is too late. And overall, there’s actually little of the overtly ‘Mitchell’ touch that seems to rub people up the wrong way, myself included on occasion, the fluid passage of time – the trial lasts for over 430 days – is well suggested by flashes of fast-forward movement, but it cannot be denied that Mitchell’s approach here is a devastatingly effective way of portraying a trial. Normally when I write reviews, I try to steer clear of reading anything else about the play so that I can capture my own response, free from the unwitting plagiarism that always seems to happen. With The Trial of Ubu though, I ended up doing a lot of reading, about Jarry and interviews with both Stephens and Mitchell, and I’m glad that I did because it definitely enriched my understanding, and thus the experience of the play. It isn’t necessarily the easiest watch, but it is genuinely unique – Mitchell may still struggle to get the respect she deserves in this country – and utterly thought-provoking – Stephens posing questions that get to the very heart of what our morality is based upon. This was one of the most mind-numbingly awful experiences I've had in 45 years of going to the theatre. The 75 minutes felt as long as the 432 days of the trial. Dire… steer well clear. Aw, I'm sorry you disliked it so much. Mitchell really is a polarising figure isn't she."
1636,1636,Ought To Be Clowns,12/10/2017,Ian,Beginning, National Theatre,"There’s something about the sweet spot as the embers of a house party start to die out – people lingering behind usually there for a reason (as in the prettiest boy I ever did kiss), conversations that delve right into the deep stuff. And so it is for Laura and Danny in David Eldridge’s new play Beginning – it’s 2.40am and he’s the last one left at the housewarming do at her new pad in Crouch End. But it’s not quite as simple as that (it never is – that boy moved to LA). Both firmly middle-aged, the weight of Laura and Danny’s potential encounter is revealed to be ever more significant as they edge towards a truth that there might be more than just a quickie on the cards, that the spark of a connection they both might be feeling could be the beginning of something more and not just a reaction to the intense loneliness they’re both feeling in this modern world. They’ve just got to get to that point. Eldridge’s writing is at its best in the earlier part of Polly Findlay’s emotionally bracing production. As inhabited by the marvellous pairing of Justine Mitchell and Sam Troughton, the painstaking process of attempted drunken seduction is hilarious to watch, the various ways Mitchell’s Laura subtly (and not so subtly – such dancing!) tries to put the moves on Danny a real joy and proof positive, as if it were needed, that Bros should definitely be left in the 80s. As the wine and beer continues to flow, the mood soon turns to one of emotional unburdening. Troughton is superb as the figure of fragile modern masculinity that is Danny, twisted up in self-doubt about his ability to be a ‘man’ but Eldridge doesn’t quite show the same commitment to fleshing out a complex portrayal of women. So Mitchell has the much tougher job of selling Laura’s over-riding desire to start a family and it is to her unending credit that she is entirely credible throughout, from predatory wine-sipping to literal soul-baring. The slow burn of this burgeoning relationship played out in real time proves hard to resist."
1637,1637,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2011,Ian,Rocket To The Moon, National Theatre,"Set in the waiting room of a dentist’s office in the oppressive heat of a New York City summer, Rocket To The Moon focuses on the midlife crisis of Ben Stark, an unhappily married dentist who encouraged by his father-in-law, a man dealing with his own frustrations in life, to pursue his own dreams. This leads him to have an affair with his new dental assistant, the luminous Cleo Singer, which starts off as a bit of fun but soon turns into something much more profound in the latest show to open at the Lyttelton. As Stark, the handsome (and finally released from Coney Island) Joseph Millson is excellent, his nervous smile betraying his emotions all-too-easily as he struggles to balance his moral position with his desire to follow his heart and even as he tumbles for Cleo, he still maintains a certain integrity to the character which is most involving. And making her theatrical debut after a well-received television career, I was quite impressed by Keeley Hawes in the rather thankless role of his highly-strung wife. She managed to bring some humanity to this woman Belle suggesting that she is as much a victim as Ben, even if Odets doesn’t allow her character that much development beyond that of the exceedingly demanding, a heartbreaking moment as she closes the door on her husband encapsulating her performance beautifully. But though it is Hawes’ debut, it is Jessica Raine as Cleo who emerges as the star of the show. I’ve followed Raine for a couple of years now and she is an actress who really excites me and she does not disappoint here in creating a character who seems as ditzy as anything as we first meet her but she slowly reveals the layers to this rather complex young woman looking for a better life so that the emotional climax makes perfect sense. I also enjoyed Nicholas Woodeson’s frustrated showman Mr Prince and Ben’s 2 colleagues, a ruminative turn from Sebastian Armesto and a quietly powerful yet moving performance from Peter Sullivan. Anthony Ward’s set design is nicely realised, with a long corridor stretching back deep down the left hand side meaning that the ripple of anticipation, as a character walks up to get to the main room, slowly moves from left to right in the audience as the people sat on the left see them well before people sat on the right hand side. And credit should go to Rebecca Elson’s costumes which looked just right and gave Hawes’ in particular some lovely dresses and nifty millinery. Rocket to the Moon is something of a slow-burner but well worth it in the end, as Odets’ portrait of an individual struggling to reconcile personal responsibility and ambition, to rise above his circumstances is powerfully moving and excellently portrayed in Angus Jackson’s production here. The only thing that concerned me was how very little the four ensemble members got to do throughout the show!"
1638,1638,Ought To Be Clowns,12/04/2019,Ian,A German Life, Bridge Theatre,"Just a quickie for this, even though Dame Maggie Smith clearly deserves more respect for her return to the London stage after 12 years away. A German Life takes the form of a 100 minute monologue that takes the breath away, not only in the technical skill and stamina for someone over the age of 80 but in the size and sensitivity of the subject matter at hand, Smith plays Brunhilde Pomsel, a regular German woman whose work as a secretary took her through many employers, one of whom just happened to be the Nazi minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. As she reflects back on her life, there’s an appalling compelling account of everyday life in the midst of the rise of such a virulently extreme ideology as Nazism.  It’s a triumph of quietly ruminative acting – there are moments of silence when you don’t know if it is Smith or Pomsel who doesn’t quite know what to say next and it is to Smith and director Jonathan Kent’s credit that it simply doesn’t matter a jot which it is. She may not leave her chair in Anna Fleischle’s domestic design but you never once lose the grip of her attention. And there’s something painfully aching about the way in Hampton’s script, adapted from Pomsel’s testimony in a documentary of the same name, slides around the awful, unpalatable truths of what she lived through. The Jewish friends that disappeared versus the rise in her salary, the thrill of voting versus the reality of rallies. To hear her talk about the concentration camps and equivocating about just how much she knew of what went on there is a masterclass in amibguity."

1641,1641,Ought To Be Clowns,08/10/2018,Ian,Citizens of Nowhere?, Southbank Centre,"There’s a delicious sort of pleasure that comes from being able to eavesdrop on a conversation on the table next to you, isn’t there. Or is it just me…? Fortunately it’s not, as that is the whole set-up of Ming Ho’s Citizens of Nowhere?, part of the China Changing Festival at the Southbank Centre. Sat at cafe tables in the foyer of Queen Elizabeth Hall, armed with headphones, we get to listen in on the British-Chinese Lo family on the table just over there. Edinburgh-based Linda has come down to London to visit with two of her kids. Jun Chi is getting married and Jane’s making waves in the local Conservative party but she’s got some pretty big news of her own to break as well. And in the way of most families, their conversation gets waylaid by the resurfacing of old history as a way of exploring current tensions, overlaid by a wide range of intersecting contemporary issues about life in the UK right now.  It’s an interesting way of staging what is essentially an audio drama and one which is highly engaging in David Jiang’s production. Even as the hustle and bustle of the Southbank Centre continues around us, there’s a curious sense of intimacy that comes from being the only ones to be able to hear these voices. It is fascinating too, to see how people react to a public space being taken over like this – the guy who pulled up a chair, the ones who stopped to just watch, the ones who went to book tickets for the next show to find it was sold out… And it helps that Ho’s play is a nuanced and compelling look at the evolution of identity, first generation experience against second generation, smashing together moments of personal crisis with the political crisis looming over us all. Jun Chi is marrying a Dutch woman so Brexit is weighing heavily on his mind; he’s an actor too, who can’t seem to get castings for any part that isn’t a stereotypical cameo. Siu Hun Li plays this perfectly, with just a hint of chippy Scot to him as he castigates his sister for losing her accent.   Jane’s political aspirations lead her to announce her own impending nuptials and the fact that her last name will go from Lo to Hargreaves has no bearing at all on the Hertfordshire voters she hopes will propel her into Westminster, honest. Jennifer Lim finds real conviction in playing off the political differences with her sibling, even as she details an incident of racial abuse with a quietly bemused tone which perhaps indicates she can’t quite fully subscribe to Toryism.  Between them is Pik-Sen Lim’s spirited Linda: retired, divorced, with four grown-up children who all live somewhere else, and a nagging sense of wanting to feel like she belongs somewhere. Born in Hong Kong, her parents brought her to the UK as a young girl, to Norfolk of all places, and the motherland is now like a siren call. There’s something achingly sad about this sense of feeling adrift and Lim’s performance catches it like smoke drifting and dissipating in the air, someone feeling terribly unmoored. "

1643,1643,Ought To Be Clowns,25/05/2018,Ian,Mayfly, Orange Tree,"Short and sweet, Mayfly continues the Orange Tree’s strong recent record of showcasing new writing by supporting debut writer Joe White with this glistening production by Guy Jones. A low-key trip through rural English life impacted by tragedy, its ephemeral nature shows much promise. In a tiny Shropshire community where village life is withering away, a family are further struggling to deal with the one-year anniversary of a particular tragedy. Grief has pole-axed mother, father, and daughter in different ways and it takes the arrival of a stranger who interacts with each to hint at light at the end of this tunnel."
1644,1644,Ought To Be Clowns,11/04/2013,Ian,Once, Phoenix,"“Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice” Unusually for a West End musical, Once gently pulses rather than powerhouses its way into the affections, beating very much to its own unique rhythm with a sublimely sensitive story of the power of music and the pain of untimely love. From the working bar on stage that welcomes the audience into the auditorium of the Phoenix with a makeshift ceilidh to the presence of quality names like Enda Walsh and John Tiffany, it is immediately clear that this is no ordinary film-to-stage transfer. Augmented and adapted by Walsh, the book covers the brief but intense journey of a guy and a girl, named Guy and Girl, who connect strongly but find that what they can sing to each other, they cannot say once the music has stopped. He’s a busking vacuum cleaner repairman missing his girlfriend in New York, she’s an unhappily married Czech mother searching for purpose and when she spots his potential, starts up a project to get him to record a demo but their feelings soon threaten to pull them onto the cusp of new possibility.  Declan Bennett and Zrinka Cvitešić exude the kind of chemistry most couples would dream of as the central pair – his taciturn intensity well-suited to Guy’s brooding demeanour and her headlong energy adorable yet dangerously reckless as Girl’s passion leaves her torn. A late scene of unspoken emotion is just beautiful, almost unbearably sad as one urges them to throw caution to the wind, cast their all-too-recognisable awkwardness to one side yet their romance remains as it always has, an anti-romance. The bittersweet tone is frequently tempered by a Celtic wit though, most often in the bar scenes and most notably in a cracking response to Guy’s declaration that he’s about to sing to one of his own songs, in a show that no only feels but looks and sounds just right.  The burnished mirror of Bob Crowley’s semi-circular pub set both adds a depth to the design but also an extra dimension to see additional details of the onstage action that might otherwise be hidden; Steven Hoggett’s movement has a magical, almost dream-like quality that characterises so much of the feeling in this world; and the actor-musicians that populate the stage with their supporting characters demonstrate huge skill on a wide range of instruments – mandolin, cello, cajon, banjo, uke, violin, bodhrán and more beside are used to bring Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová’s score to sonorous life. The music fits more into the Irish troubadouring tradition of people like David Gray and Damien Rice and though it has moments where it is perilously close to becoming bland, there are many more where it shimmers gorgeously. The Oscar-winning ‘Falling Slowly’ sets the template perfectly, a heartfelt duet that builds and builds as more and more musicians chip in from the side to give a beautifully layered musical treat. Bennett’s Guy rips through ‘Leave’ with passionate verve and Cvitešić’s Girl imbues ‘The Hill’ with a lifetime of longing but it is the ensemble numbers that genuinely touch the soul – a hushed a capella rendition of ‘Gold’ is just spine-tingling and the final reprise of ‘Falling Slowly’ is a enchanting demonstration of the power and the beauty in the communal."
1645,1645,Ought To Be Clowns,14/01/2010,Ian,The Rivals, Southwark Playhouse,"Taking up residence at the Southwark Playhouse is this new production of Richard Sheridan’s The Rivals, mixing music and dance with a very high calibre cast to create a fresh new look at this well-known comedy. Set in eighteenth century Bath, it follows the efforts of the meddlesome Mrs Malaprop to marry off her niece Lydia Languish, who has romantic designs of her own, but with an array of suitors, some of whom are not all who they seem, the scene is set for a plethora of romantic capers.
I loved the opening: the cast trickle onto the stage and chat away to the audience as if we’re all here for a ball, then up strikes the music and there’s a wickedly subversive choice of songs for an opening dance number which set the tone for this mischievous little production. There’s a real convivial atmosphere throughout, with plenty of fourth-wall-breaking going on (be warned if you’re on the front row!) and the cast play up to the intimacy of the venue with a strong conversational style. It’s led by a trio of high-profile female performances. The stunningly beautiful Charity Wakefield as a playful Lydia is spritely good fun and charmingly engaging and Ella Smith as Julia does well with the lightest of touches on some very wordy scenes and showing off a melodious voice and some flute-playing thrown in for good measure. But it is Celia Imrie as Mrs Malaprop who is the star of the show: this being my first viewing of The Rivals, I can hardly imagine anyone else doing better in the role, it seems tailor-made for her. She endows her with such warmth and humour that one tended to find oneself laughing with and not really at her, and it is genuinely distressing to see her discover the truth about who has written the letters mocking her. Imrie seizes every opportunity to display her comic chops too, the incredible misjudged verbosity is always well-delivered, the constant shooing away of the recorder-playing heralds was a nice touch and her seductive swaying is just a sight to behold. Among the boys, Harry Hadden-Paton as the dashing Captain Absolute and Tom McDonald as the ever-anguished Faulkland give great value for money, as does Robin Soans as the irascible Sir Anthony Absolute, but they are all somewhat upstaged by Christopher Logan’s Mr Acres who owns the second half with a brilliant comic performance that left me frequently helpless with laughter. There’s also great support amongst the serving classes: Jenni Maitland’s manipulative maid being a flirtatious delight, and Oliver Hollis and Sam Swainsbury as members of the Absolute household radiated a genial affability (even practically sitting in my lap at one point!) and displaying impressive multi-instrumental skills, including the recorder which amused me to no end. The staging is simple, a Georgian living room evoked with some hanging windows and furniture, but the costumes looked striking and nicely opulent. It is great to see a theatre such as the Southwark Playhouse punching well above their weight with some superb casting, giving us the opportunity to see such talent as Dame-in-waiting Celia Imrie at such close quarters. And all told, this is a delightful, extremely funny production of a play which may be familiar to many, but is presented here with a freshness and inventiveness that should please most everyone. Agree with your comments about the play, but the seating is terible: uncomfortable, unreserved, too many squashed on. Not good enough I loved this show, but wanted more of the music and dancing, I loved the Beyonce medley at the beginning!"
1646,1646,Ought To Be Clowns,18/03/2017,mag9l,Roman Tragedies, Toneelgroep Amsterdam at the Barbican,"8 years ago, I’d barely started to blog, I didn’t know who Ivo van Hove was, Andrew Haydon didn’t know who I was, it was an altogether simpler time. And I’d be hard pressed to tell you exactly what it was that made me click on the Barbican’s website to book for a 6 hour long Shakespearean epic in Dutch but I’m glad I did, for it genuinely changed the world for me (in terms of my theatrical life anyway, who knew I’d start going to Amsterdam regularly for theatre!). I ranked the show as the best of the year for me back then in 2009 and I have to say I still think it is the greatest piece of theatre I’ve ever seen. So going back for seconds was always going to be a risk but it was also something I knew I’d never be able to resist. Not least because in the intervening period, van Hove has become one of the most famous, and arguably influential, directors around. His take on A View From The Bridge was the breakthrough moment but for me, it has been his work with Toneelgroep Amsterdam that has consistently been the most revelatory – Kings of War and Scenes from a Marriage both at the Barbican, Long Day’s Journey into Night and the breathtaking Maria Stuart at the gorgeous Stadsschouwburg. But I digress. Roman Tragedies conflates Coriolanus, Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra into a single free-flowing drama, with short pauses inserted rather than lengthy intervals, designed to allow the audience to move around the theatre to watch the show from different places, even from on the stage itself. Together with long-term design collaborator Jan Versweyveld, van Hove has proved masterful at challenging traditional uses of theatrical spaces and as we’re encouraged to take pics and livetweet, there’s something wonderfully subversive about it all (perhaps it’s the knowledge that it is pissing David Hare off so much…). And lest you think this is all just a gimmick, the adaptation by Alexander Schreuder, Bart Van den Eynde, and Jan Peter Gerrits from Tom Kleijn’s translation is fiercely intelligent as ancient history blurs into contemporary politics, the exploration of ever-shifting power dynamics and the performative hollowness of politics feel like it could have been ripped from today’s front pages (well, perhaps not the Evening Standard’s…). Intuitive cross-gender casting (Marieke Heebink’s fierce Cassius, Maria Kraakman’s possible hope for the future in Octavius Caesar) puts masculinity-in-crisis under the spotlight and the very nature of democracy being questioned could not be more pertinent if it tried. That it still feels so relevant is all the more surprising considering that this adaptation is now more than 10 years old, but it is still so radical (to UK theatre audiences at least) a take on Shakespeare that it can’t help but feel vibrant and vital."
1647,1647,Ought To Be Clowns,10/10/2017,Ian,Young Frankenstein, Garrick,"It’s alive…barely. Mel Brooks’ Young Frankenstein staggers into the West End after some more time on the operating table since its 2007 Broadway opening (2 new songs are among the changes made) and a short run in Newcastle to tighten the bolts. But for a piece of new musical theatre, it is so desperately old-fashioned that you half expect Russ Abbot and Bella Emberg to pop up and do a turn. Given that Brooks is now over 90 and that the film on which it is based dates from 1974, it is perhaps little surprise that it feels dated. But also given director/choreographer Susan Stroman’s close collaborative relationship with him, the opportunity to be necessarily brutal about what works and what doesn’t feels to have been lost, lightning really hasn’t struck twice for the creators of The Producers.  So Transylvania becomes a generic version of Mitteleuropa where four time Olivier nominees are reduced to embarrassing yodelling damsel stereotypes, legends (don’t @ me) like Lesley Joseph are criminally underused as one-note supporting characters, there isn’t a single joke which isn’t milked until it stopped being funny 10 minutes ago, and the best musical number – in this new musical remember – is an extended dance break to Irving Berlin’s ‘Puttin’ On The Ritz’. It’s a really good routine actually, Shuler Hensley’s Creature nailing the joy that good musical theatre can bring, but it only exacerbates how disposable most of Brooks’ score is. There are spots of respite mainly due to the tireless performance level – Hadley Fraser as Frederick Frankenstein (‘it’s pronounced Fronkensteen!) is unflagging as the grandson of Victor who can’t escape his family’s legacy try as he might, and Dianne Pilkington as his heiress fiancée nails a rare musical highlight in ‘Please Don’t Touch Me’."

1650,1650,Ought To Be Clowns,20/03/2017,mag9l,Love in Idleness, Menier Chocolate Factory,"Overlord of all that is authentic in British theatre, Trevor Nunn is now further redefining authenticity by presenting us with a Terence Rattigan premiere, cobbled together from two pre-existing versions of the same play. Love in Idleness was originally known as Less Than Kind (which itself was seen at the Jermyn Street back in 2011) but was rewritten at the behest of its stars, a commercially minded decision which proved fatal to Rattigan’s reputation. And rather than choose one or the other, Nunn has fashioned something new (but assumably still authentic), named for the later version. Sadly, that sense of compromise lingers strongly here. Fans of Rattigan were utterly spoiled by pitch-perfect interpretations of After the Dance and Flare Path (also by Nunn) at the beginning of this decade and again last year with an excoriating The Deep Blue Sea, so knowing the emotional force with which he can devastate us can only leave you disappointed at the tonally strange and inconsequential comedy of sorts with which we’re presented here. Only the long-awaited return of the marvellous Eve Best to the London stage imbues the evening with the quality it scarcely deserves. The plot is a trifle – set towards the end of the Second World War, precocious 18 year old Michael Brown returns from evacuation to Canada appalled to find his mother Olivia contentedly shacked up with a government minister. Never mind the fact that she’s a widow and he’s unhappily married, the newly politically aware kid is determined to break the match. But though I did enjoy Less Than Kind on first viewing, Love in Idleness gets stranded in the shallower waters in which it paddles, ditching any substantive sense of the wartime setting (beyond newsreel footage played in scene changes) and late-arriving farcical shenanigans further disturbing the potential for emotional profundity."
1651,1651,Ought To Be Clowns,29/03/2016,mag9l,Right Now (À Présent), Bush,"As any fule kno, purple underwear had its cultural apotheosis in Back to the Future but there’s a scene in Catherine-Anne Toupin’s Right Now (À Présent) that threatens to wrest that title from Michael J Fox and anoint the delicious Maureen Beattie in his place. But lingerie aside, there’s much more in play in this fascinatingly twisty piece of writing from this Québécois playwright, a transfer from Theatre Royal Bath’s Ustinov Studio which has already toyed extensively with our perceptions in The Father and The Mother which have also been exported down the M4 in recent months. Here, it’s Alice who has tumbled down the theatrical rabbit-hole into a world of increasing strangeness. Installed in a swanky new apartment with doctor husband Ben, life ought to be swell but there’s clearly something awry – their physical intimacy is severely stilted, a child’s toy left on the floor provokes the tensest of exchanges, her sleeping patterns are wrecked and he’s working all the hours God sends. All the while, a baby’s cries haunt the room… So the arrival of orchid-bearing Juliette from across the hallway, along with son François and husband Gilles and their promises of drinks and dinner parties ought to release the pressure valve – after all everybody needs good neighbours. What it actually does though, is tip Alice’s world off-kilter. Slowly at first but then wrenching it right off its axis in a storm of psychosexual intrigue, Bacchanalian excess and emotional turbulence. The dislocation that she, and we the audience, feel may be less pronounced than the aforementioned works of Zeller but that actually makes it more chilling. Toupin’s writing – expertly translated by Chris Campbell – revels in the complexity of its strangeness, its absurdity almost, as it calls into question pretty much everything that it sets before us.  Lindsey Campbell is excellent as Alice, unnerved at first by the intrusions into her seemingly hermetic existence but then abandoning herself (or is it her self) to the attentions thrust upon her. Maureen Beattie offers up a gloriously comic creation as the domineeringly inquisitive Juliette, supported by a suavely seductive Guy Williams as Gilles who thoroughly insinuate themselves into the domestic and romantic lives of Alice and Sean Biggerstaff’s Ben. And as their man-child of a son François, Dyfan Dwyfor delivers a sensational performance in tracking his considerable evolution from the unexpected to the even more unexpected.  Michael Boyd’s direction keeps a firm enough hand on the tiller to ensure we’re never too lost and Madeleine Girling’s set expertly evokes both the fanciness and the fluidity of the situation, aided by the intelligent undulations of Oliver Fenwick’s lighting. And as it becomes more surreal, the darkness it suggests becomes ever more disturbing, the laughter it provokes catching in the mouth as sharp as a freshly squeezed lime. Inspired, bracing stuff.  "
1652,1652,Ought To Be Clowns,29/12/2014,Ian,Maria Stuart, Stadschouwburg Amsterdam,"That it is Ivo van Hove directing Maria Stuart certainly didn’t hurt either and sure enough, the mastery of his theatrical vision is fully in evidence once again. Schiller’s regal drama sets up two opposing queens, the protestant Elizabeth I and her Catholic cousin Mary Queen of Scots, as their deadly rivalry comes to a head but for all their disagreements and differences, van Hove shows us how they are as much the same as different, two sides of the same coin trapped by the political machinations of men. So Jan Versweyveld’s gloomily officious set is both dungeon and palace, both women as much a prisoner as the other even though it is Elizabeth who has Mary in chains (the sonic bursts in the flashes of darkness that herald the arrival of a monarch are beautifully done). And Wojciech Dziedzic’s costumes places everyone in dark suits so the courtiers who swarm around the queens pushing their own political ambitions become both anonymous and synonymous with the male-dominated society. And this is what the women are forced to deal with in attempting to resolve their respective situations. As she debates signing Mary’s death warrant, Nietvelt’s Elizabeth must deal with a court that would see her married at all costs, whether to Maarten Heijmans’ marvellously thrusting Aubespine (the overt sexuality of choreography is stunning here) or to Kesting’s imperious and inscrutable Leicester who thinks nothing of nuzzling his queen in order to get his way. Equally, Halina Reijn’s Mary is forced to play the men’s games. The discovery that Matteo Simoni’s fervent Mortimer is secretly on her side is accompanied with sexual demand and thus as one of the few tools left at her disposal, she must use her sexuality. But what Reijn skilfully shows is that Mary is a woman coming to terms with her destiny and determined, pleased even, to be able to build to an operatic climax. The choice to have her finally step into a regal gown is devastatingly powerful in her final scene, Katelijne Damen’s lady’s maid Kennedy just superb here too, and the execution is staged with all the breath-taking, sense-enhancing verve we now expect – a truly iconic piece of theatrecraft. And then as the play turns to Elizabeth in its final moments, there’s a marvellous, severe harshness. Nietvelt too is finally adorned with the finery with which we normally associate this monarch but it serves to eliminate humanity – the brusqueness with which she deals with anyone who can attest to her decision is appalling, a stiff reprise of the earlier dance is appalling as we see the frame of her dress like a protective barrier stopping anyone getting up close and personal ever again. Nietvelt nails the ambivalence of this victory of sorts and it is an extraordinary way to finish an extraordinary production."
1653,1653,Ought To Be Clowns,09/04/2015,mag9l,After Electra, Tricycle,"On the one hand, it’s rather flipping marvellous to see a play that places multiple older female characters at its heart, continuing the stirring efforts of Indhu Rubasingham’s artistic directorship at the Tricycle Theatre to continue to broaden the scope of the stories it tells, far beyond the white male dominance we often see on our stages. And its themes of individual expression versus maternal love fit neatly into an emerging trend that we’ve seen in contemporary plays I’ve really loved like Love Love Love and The Last of the Haussmans. On the other hand, I’m not too sure that I really liked April De Angelis’ After Electra, a Theatre Royal Plymouth production directed here by Prince Caspian himself Samuel West. It has a sparky beginning as uncompromising artist Virgie decides to celebrate her 81st birthday with family and friends by declaring that she’s going to take her own life while she’s still compos mentis enough for it to be her decision. Notions of what longer life expectancy really means and how that impacts on familial relationships suggest something intriguing lurking in Michael Taylor’s handsomely appointed set. The first half plays out with a near-sitcom-like sense of humour as the procession of guests – Virgie’s gloomy daughter Haydn, the pretentious couple of old friends, her chalk’n’cheese sister and her schlub of a son – all find out about the suicidal plan and react in their own, mostly selfish, ways. But trying to off herself doesn’t quite come off as she planned and the second half takes a darker turn as the very thing she feared takes over Virgie’s life and the resentments and turmoil of their shared past family life come back to the surface in vicious ways."
1654,1654,Ought To Be Clowns,06/12/2011,Ian,Haunted Child, Royal Court,"Joe Penhall’s first work for the stage since 2007, Haunted Child, makes for a much different kind of festive show at the Royal Court than last year’s raucous Get Santa! and given his reputation, for plays like Blue/Orange, I was quite looking forward to this. But when the blurb on the back of the playtext starts quoting the play itself, you know there’s trouble ahead. “After attending an innocuous motivational course involving esoteric philosophy, Douglas mysteriously abandons his wife and son to ‘live in a specific, preordained way according to the tenets of a spiritual leader’.” Big words to cover up what is essentially a rather basic set-up. Young Thomas is wetting the bed and acting up with his mother Julie as his father Douglas has gone AWOL. When Douglas suddenly resurfaces, the relief felt soon turns to dread as it becomes apparent that he has joined a ‘group’, the nature of which we slowly learn more about as he tries to impose his completely altered mindset onto his wife and child. And that’s about it. There’s a lot of talk about the effect of adults’ behaviour on their children which is nothing new, and not enough exploration into what pushed Douglas into such extreme behaviour and the seductive allure of organised cult-like groupings. This was a preview performance so the usual caveats apply but I doubt that I would have enjoyed this play at any stage in the run if I’m brutally honest. Little colour is added into the characters to make them engaging and so once the premise has been established, the play just goes round and round the same points without providing much of revelatory interest. Ben Daniels’ brainwashed, bedraggled and bare-footed Douglas has a desperate quality which is never quite mined enough, his repetition of the mantras of a ‘better kind of life’ hinting at the nefarious practices of his new friends, but the reasons why any of this is happening are just too elusive. Jack Boulter, one of two boys covering the role of Thomas, handles the role with a tentative poise, this young person thrust awkwardly into the world of adult reality far too soon and he conveys a mightily touching relationship with Daniels, desperate to be loved by his father and willing to play along with, and seemingly forgive, anything he does or says – no matter how disturbing. Against them is a quietly intense performance from Sophie Okonedo as Julia, whose relationship with her son is tested as his understandably frustrated line of questioning gets no easy answers, and whose marriage is clearly under severe threat. But because Penhall has chosen to have Douglas’ disappearance come out of the blue – which I suppose is how many of these things, if we’re talking about mental breaks, happen in real life, without warning – the decision to thus not explain it means the audience, along with Julia, is left wafting around for any kernel of a clue. An attempt to give Julia something of a troubled mindset as Douglas tries to win her over sticks out like a sore thumb – would friends and family not have rallied around her? – and quite frankly, her toleration of her husband’s proposed course of action just does not ring true. So, Haunted Child was not a good experience for me. At no point did I find any member of this family interesting or care enough to want to find out their fates, and it made for a dull evening in the theatre for me. It seemed to be a popular opinion as there were seven walkouts on my row alone after the interval. I would struggle to tell you what I thought Penhall was trying to achieve with this play, what he was trying to say. Maybe others will see more in this rather nihilistic view than I did and I shall look forward to seeing what other bloggers and critics have to say about it. Thank God you've finished your review –  now I can tell all the rabid ""But you didn't say to the end"" people to read this one instead of mine! Still, I'm SO glad I left. The trouble with this play is that it is difficult to be certain what it is trying to tell us. It seems to want to tackle too many things within a two hour period. It was the cast that persuaded me to stay till the end even if I found Okonedo's Julie far too patient and forgiving. Overall this play is implausible. Well it is hard to blog a show having left at the interval, that's why I've sat through so much I would rather have left."
1655,1655,Ought To Be Clowns,28/02/2015,mag9l,Multitudes, Tricycle,"It’s hard to imagine a time, in the near future at least, when multiculturalism in the UK won’t be a hot button issue – if nothing else, what would certain elements of the press be pitifully obsessed with instead? So naturally, John Hollingworth’s play Multitudes – his first – feels well timed, how could it not – Jihadi John and schoolgirl recruits for Islamic State dominate the front pages, the shockwaves of Charlie Hebdo are still rippling around with inflammatory polls further stirring the pot and the nefarious impact of UKIP on British politics remains impossible to escape, Trying to make sense of these multiple strands is a job and a half for even the most seasoned of commentators and it’s not immediately apparent that Hollingworth is the man for the job as he layers all this and more into his play. But once Indhu Rubasingham’s production finds its feet in the swirl of the melting pot and one becomes accustomed to its rhythms, Multitudes’ noisy energy makes sense. Hollingworth doesn’t set out to give us answers, such as they could possibly exist, but rather gives a portrayal of of the messiness of race debates in British society. This he does by intertwining the trials of an extended Bradford family. Tory councillor Kash wants to become an MP but a new war of terror )and its accompanying political rhetoric) has stoked anti-Muslim sentiment and his daughter Qadira is part of an increasingly vocal anti-war peace camp who want to disrupt the Conservative Party conference. On top of that, Kash’s white partner has converted to Islam which in turn has provoked her mother, a Tory grandee in her own right, to go public with her own anti-immigrant bigotry. With supporting character two-a-penny too, there’s a lot to take in."
1656,1656,Ought To Be Clowns,11/01/2020,Ian,Antigone, New Diorama,"There’s a pleasing trend toward giving voice to the under-represented through revisiting familiar narratives (cf Six, & Juliet; Teenage Dick) and Holy What’s new production of Antigone makes for a fine addition to that canon. Lulu Raczka’s adaptation of Sophocles’ Greek classic resites the story as an ongoing  interaction between the two sisters Antigone and Ismene and proves all the more compelling for it. The result is a restless psychological study that forefronts sisterhood, teenage emotion and the impact that trauma has on those left behind. Set in the elegant but eerie space of Lizzie Leech’s metatheatrical design, Tig and Issy play a series of games to try and distract themselves from the fact that their Uncle Creon has locked them in while their brothers Eteocles and Polynices wage civil war against each other. But games only go so far…  Dressed in t-shirts and party dresses, Annabel Baldwin and Rachel Hosker both give greatly ebullient spirit to Antigone and Ismene respectively, trying to remain ensconced in a coccoon of imagined nights out in bar with men who buy them beer. They both know they can’t go outside, detested as the ruling class is by the ordinary Thebans, which only makes Antigone’s crucial decision to tend to the body of the fallen Polynices all the more fatalistic."
1657,1657,Ought To Be Clowns,27/05/2014,mag9l,John Ferguson, Finborough,"There is often the sense that selective quoting from the Bible can assert pretty much any viewpoint and so it turns out in St John Ervine’s John Ferguson, receiving its first airing in the UK for nearly 100 years with this production at the Finborough Theatre, directed by Emma Faulkner. Set in the 1880s in the unforgiving Ulster farmland of County Down, it centres on the Ferguson family and the trials they are forced to ensure when threatened with foreclosure by their grasping neighbour and tenant-holder, the dastardly Henry Witherow. Ageing paterfamilias John is unwell and thus unable to work the land that gives them their living, finding succour instead from burying his head in a well-worn copy of the Bible. And in a reversal of roles, his son Andrew is induced to return from his training to join the ministry in order to run the farm. But he is ill-suited to the job at hand, they’re behind with payments and the promised cheque from John’s brother in America has failed to materialise. The only collateral they seem to possess comes in the form of daughter Hannah’s hand.  And thus the moral dilemma of the play is formed. All the family’s problems could be solved if Hannah married a man she doesn’t love – the earnest if dull James Caesar – but Witherow has his beady eye on her too and an ill-advised walk in the dark sets in chain a series of events which threatens to swallow up the whole family whole, and which no amount of psalm quoting can hold at bay. The role of faith in the play initially feels very much of its time but as it progresses and as John allows himself to guided so thoroughly, even blindly, it becomes increasingly pertinent. Ciaran McIntyre is convicning as a man desperate to find purpose in even the most horrific of events and he is well matched by Veronica Quilligan as his much more pragmatic wife who sees everything crumbling. Zoe Rainey’s Hannah is a vivid presence, chafing at her lack of agency in this world, and yet grateful for the interventions of her taciturn brother, a grimly satisfying turn from Alan Turkington. Faulkner encourages a strong emotional honesty from her actors which does much to cover the occasional longueurs in the dialogue and raise the stakes of this melodrama."
1658,1658,Ought To Be Clowns,04/12/2011,Ian,Aladdin, Lyric Hammersmith,"The Hackney Empire currently has the reputation of the must-see pantomime in London but the Lyric Hammersmith has been crafting its own little niche in the market and I’d happily wager that with Aladdin this year they have truly come up with the goods and I doubt that this panto will be bettered this year. Co-writers Steve Marmion, Joel Horwood and Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, returning from last year’s Dick Whittington along with much of the same crew and cast, continue to reinvigorate the form by working in a fresh contemporary vibe whilst never losing sight of what makes a panto work. There’s nothing old-fashioned about this trip to Ha-Maa-Smiitt (say it with an East Asian accent…) where the dastardly Abanazar is plotting to take over the kingdom, whilst unassuming, sweet-nicking Aladdin daydreams of a better life with the Princess Karen until he is thrust into action to save the day. The script is punchy with a few neat topical references and absolutely chock-ablock with jokes which work on all levels (I was relieved to see the kids in front us perplexed as to why we were laughing so much as Widow Twanky departed on a washing machine) I was laughing out loud throughout the entire show, especially with the physical humour. But it is also a visual treat: Tom Scutt’s costume and set design is sunny and bright, Mark Smith has come up with some interesting choreography and with the magic carpet sequence, there is pure awe-inspiring theatrical magic at work. It would be unfair to say more about it but rest assured it is worth the ticket price alone. One of the major strengths of this creative team is their understanding of how to make each element of the show feel as vital as the other and this is never more evident than in the use of music. The way in which the songs – many of them recent chart hits – have been rewritten makes them feel an integral part of the production. Sometimes it is only a little lyrical tweaking, working in references to Hammersmith for example; sometimes it is a wholesale change, as in the genius version of Mr Boombastic that is Mr Abanazar or the way in which U Can’t Touch This is delivered, but it is always clever and essential – just look at how the contrasting viewpoints of Price Tag and Billionaire are counterpointed as Princess Karen and Aladdin sing about their respective dreams. (Oddly enough though, at least two of the songs in here were included in the Hackney Empire’s Cinderella as well.) The returning cast members are obviously relishing being back in each other’s company: Steven Webb’s appealing Wishy-Washy – Aladdin’s brother but here a blue monkey, what else – is a ball of refreshing energy who can pull off a nifty dance routine or 3, Simon Kunz is a delightful villain as Abanazar and Shaun Prendergast pulls off another exceptional dame as Widow Twanky, rattling out joke after joke with warmth and affection – it’s a delight to watch them. Among the others, Nigel Betts is hilarious as the animal-loving Emperor and the wise Genie, Sophia Nomvete shows off an incredible voice and bags of character as the Spirit of the Ring and Dominique Moore’s Princess Karen is sweetly done. And there’s a palpable sense of camaraderie amongst the whole group that adds a lovely frisson of excitement as one is (as are the cast I imagine) never quite sure where the next joke is going to come from. Not everything works quite as perfectly. Hammed Animashaun’s Aladdin is so laidback as to be on the verge of disinterest, I felt he could have done much more to try and connect with the audience. He is not helped by being lumbered with a call and response bit that fell flat for being frankly rather unintelligible no matter how many times we did it, but Animashaun showed little interest in trying to whip up enthusiasm for it. Webb’s Wishy Washy also has an overly complicated response to try and help him remember his name but he does a lot more to work with the audience impressively."
1659,1659,Ought To Be Clowns,27/03/2014,mag9l,The Events, Artsdepot,"David Greig’s The Events turned out to be quite the success in 2013, deeply affecting audiences from the Edinburgh Fringe through to the Guardian critics who voted it their show of the year. So it is perhaps unsurprising to see Actors Touring Company resurrecting their production for a new tour in 2014 but what is more impressive is the reach that this piece of theatre has managed to achieve in so relatively short a space of time. A Norwegian production has just opened, a German translation has played Vienna and will go to Dammen, and this particular tour will revisit the Young Vic, amongst other places, before heading over to the USA. So clearly, something is working in this quietly dramatic response to the atrocities committed by Anders Breivik when he slaughtered 77 Norwegians in the summer of 2011. With director Ramin Gray, Greig explores how a similar but fictional tragedy reverberates throughout a community – the differing individual responses from victims and those more tangentially affected, the communal reaction as a whole, even the experiences of the killer himself, as a liberal priest searches for answers as to why she survived the attack that left so many of her fellow choir-members dead.  First time round, I did enjoy the show, although ‘enjoy’ is completely the wrong word, but found it be something I felt rather than truly understood. It is undoubtedly highly charged with emotion but the very nature of its format means it is fragmented, fraught, sometimes difficult to follow. So the opportunity to see it for a second time, after also having read the play a couple of times, was one I was glad to be able to take, and it did a lot to enrich the experience. Like the messiness left behind in a crisis, The Events is dense, complex, confused and compelling – angry at what has happened, unsure of how to move forward."
1660,1660,Ought To Be Clowns,20/03/2010,Ian,The White Guard, National,"The White Guard is a look at the price that is paid by people during wartime: both on the grand political scale, but also on the personal and family lives. Set in the Ukraine in 1918, we follow the Turbin family as they struggle to maintain their lives in a Kiev ravaged by the just-ended First World War, yet flung headlong into the Russian Civil War which ensued immediately after. The Turbin’s apartment is presided over by the luminous Lena, around whom a coterie of assorted characters gravitate, as the tumultuous sequence of events and invaders threaten to irrevocably change to everyone’s way of life. Events are indeed somewhat confusing, but by viewing them through the prism of the Turbin household, there’s a real sense of the disorientation that must have been felt at such a time. Without the modern 24 hour stream of news, every piece of information that comes through the door is so much more valuable in trying to work through the uncertainty and confusion. Yet through this time of turmoil, the camaraderie between this group of people is as strong as ever, as they laugh, sing, eat and drink much vodka, seeking solace in their love for each other and for their country. Between Bulgakov’s writing and Upton’s translation, a great success has been achieved in creating a raft of rounded characters with real warmth and to whom we grow quite attached. Incontrovertibly Russian and genuinely funny, I could happily have joined their dinner table and necked a few shots of vodka with them. As the lone female (of note) Justine Mitchell’s Lena is the beating heart of this play, but there are delicious performances to be found throughout, ranging from Conleth Hill’s comic and strangely alluring Leonid, Pip Carter’s nerdish but beautifully affecting Larion, and my sneaking favourite Paul Higgins(the wonderful sweary Jamie from The Thick of It). There’s actually a surprisingly large cast, which results an additional series of cameos, the best of which is Anthony Calf’s The Hetman, a puppet leader much more concerned with saving his own skin than his country. Funny, moving, wistful and engaging throughout, I really enjoyed this play and highly recommend it: it’s also visually stunning, if sets and scene changes took curtain calls, I’d’ve given a standing ovation! After the high standard set by London Assurance, The White Guard maintains the absolutely cracking start to this new season at the National Theatre, and I’m now looking forward even more to the rest of the plays set to open shortly. The sets are quite frankly amazing. The opening drawing room alone is worth the ticket price, well dressed and effectively enhanced with beautifully observed little details like snow falling, visible through a back window and a great depth looking through the doors into a stairwell. Later on comes others, the best of which is a starkly empty huge palace room, but the joy is in the transitions: inventive and so much fun! Another accurate and considered review Ian, great stuff.  You also nailed The Gods Weep for the utter crap it is; keep it up. Did you have a good seat? I'm trying to figure out why this show is so divisive – some are enthralled, some bored. Very strange. Current theory: closeness lends enchantment."
1661,1661,Ought To Be Clowns,25/02/2019,Ian,Scream Phone, VAULT Festival,"Funny story – I didn’t get to see Swipe Right Theatre’s last show 2 Become 1 because when I got to the theatre, they’d cancelled the performance and neglected to tell me. But I’m not (that) bitter (honest) and so I was glad to be able to see their follow up musical Scream Phone as part of this year’s VAULT programme. And I’m mighty glad I did because theirs is an 80s referencing, horror movie-spoofing, tongue-in-cheek kind of humour that is right up my boulevard and it is on fine form here. It’s 1989, Queen Bee Melody is hosting a sleepover for her pals: she;s got her new Dream Phone at the ready, the pizza’s coming and Richard* the foreign exchange student is in town – all the ingredients for a real good time right? Well yes, a real good time indeed. Scream Phone is sprinkled liberally with pop classics which have been wittily rewritten and brilliantly staged. Madonna would kill for a tune like ‘What a Big Ball’ and its splits, so too the Eurythmics with the raw sexuality of ‘Some Pots (Are Made of Clay) which was a seminal influence on the film Ghost which came out in 1990 after all and so had to have copied these guys here, right?!  Swipe Right’s is a deliciously silly sense of humour. Alexandra Lewis’ nerdish Stacey and Natasha Granger’s Regina George-esque Melody are both great value for money but Kerrie Thomason’s performance is a minor-key work of comic genius, she has the kind of stage presence you cannot drag your eyes from and more often than not, she had me in stitches. "
1662,1662,Ought To Be Clowns,04/10/2018,Ian,Cock, Minerva,"Sometimes you look back at a cast you’ve seen and think wow, I’m glad I booked for that. The original Royal Court production of Mike Bartlett’s Cock – revived here at Chichester’s Minerva – had a cast that included no less than Katherine Parkinson, Andrew Scott and Ben Whishaw enclosed in the claustrophobic intimacy of Miriam Buether’s brilliant design. So no pressure for director Kate Hewitt to live up to, honest… And it is pressure that she lives up to, mainly because Bartlett’s play remains as fresh as a daisy (chain) nearly 10 years after it was written. Its exploration of fluid sexuality feels ripped out of the frothing mouth of clickbait-muffin Piers Morgan, its rejection of conventional sexual identity labels still a key issue for many, the complication of the dating world in the 21st century as sharply pertinent as ever.
  This is personified in Luke Thallon’s John. After being shacked up with a guy for seven years, a chance encounter on his commute leads him into his first sexual relationship with a woman. Is he no longer gay? Is he now bisexual? Can he decide which of his lovers – Matthew Needham’s M or Isabella Laughland’s F – he wants to stay with? Will society let him make the decision he wants to or force him into something more conventional. Hewitt clearly has a keen sense of the adversarial nature of Bartlett’s knife-sharp writing and with Georgia Lowe’s design opening out the Minerva into the round, relishes in its gladiatorial nature. Guy Hoare’s lighting counts out the rounds as it flashes between scenes but the contact here remains linguistic, who needs physical contact when words can cut this deep?"
1663,1663,Ought To Be Clowns,08/03/2020,Ian,(Wo)men Rule Broadway [West End Edition], VAULT Festival,"There’s no arguing that the musical theatre songbook is skewed in favour of men and with theatre’s enduring love of a revival, that means the opportunities for women to express the fullness of their selves onstage have always been limited (hell, even as I write this a man has been announced to play Mother Superier in the Edinburgh run of Sister Act…).  This is the world US performers Genevieve Flati and Kelly Rogers are trying to reshape just a little with their show (Wo)men Rule Broadway [West End Edition], making its international debut here at the VAULT Festival. More than just a gender-reversed concert, Flati and Rogers compere the evening with a running commentary of how and why these songs have been chosen, exploring and explaining the boundaries being broken here.     It’s a neat way of contextualising the show, reinforcing the message that will be painfully clear to some and yank the rest out of their oblivious stupor. Something seemingly as simple as women getting to express camaraderie (Katie Hartland leading the company in a sparkling ‘Brotherhood of Man’ from How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying) or creative ambition (Hannah Cheetham’s ‘Hard to be the Bard’ from Something Rotten)."
1664,1664,Ought To Be Clowns,10/01/2015,Ian,Play of Thrones, Union,"Director and adaptor Phil Willmott has made something of a point of mixing things up when it comes to Shakespeare at the Union. He’s revived the rarely seen King John, unearthed the controversial Double Falsehood, cast a female Lear and there’s no exception with Play of Thrones. Taking George R R Martin’s inspiration of The Wars of the Roses as a starting point, Willmott has fashioned a free adaptation of the three Henry VI plays, using Part Three as the spine for a story of epic sweep of warring kings, bloody betrayals and fierce ambition that wouldn’t be out of place in Westeros. So we see the Houses of Lancaster and York tussle again for England’s crown as the kingdom is fatally destabilised by the death of Henry V and the accession of his infant son, Henry VI. The rival dynasties scheme away making politically advantageous marriages, starting surreptitious strategic affairs, setting up any number of brutal murders, even invoking otherworldly spirits to ensure that they win the game. So far so Song of Ice and Fire and there is fun to be had in spotting familiar character traits – Ygritte’s warrior spirit, Cersei’s cold manipulations, Joffrey’s immature obnoxiousness, Tyrion’s tactical nous. 
But it’s best not to get too hung up on the Game of Thrones connection as they are their own beasts (plus there are no dragons, or White Walkers here) and the only heaving bosom in sight belongs to the Duke of Suffolk’s pecs (Gavin Kerr, in fine form). His sly machinations are a highlight of a first half that has to introduce a voiceover to clarify some of the historical complexity but this awkwardness slips away after the interval as Michael Keane’s truly disturbing soon-to-be Richard III slinks into view with all the instruments of torture needed to clamber his way to the top of the pile. A nifty bit of text modification promotes the royal claim of Penelope Day’s Duchess of York and allows for a fearsome rivalry with Emma Kelly’s brilliantly ruthless Margaret of Anjou (wife to Henry VI, lover to Suffolk) and Abigail Carter-Simpson’s Joan La Pucelle completes an impressive (particularly for Shakespeare) set of female characters. And some bracing honesty from Willmott in the programme notes explains a cost-saving approach to design, the simplicity of which opens out the first half and becomes noisily effective in the battle-strewn second."
1665,1665,Ought To Be Clowns,27/09/2012,Ian,Legally Blonde The Musical, New Wimbledon,"Legally Blonde The Musical turned out to be something of a surprise: a show that I grew to really love over my three visits during its West End run (review#1, review#2, review#3), whilst making a bona fide star out of its leading lady Sheridan Smith. I may not have been blown away by it on first viewing, but it worked its way into my heart and its soundtrack is one that I listen to quite often even now. Capitalising on its finish in London, a national tour of the show has taken up shop in the New Wimbledon Theatre, giving Londoners another chance to dip into the world of Elle Woods, if they’re willing to go to zone 3 that is. Revisiting something that was so enjoyed though can have its pitfalls, as comparisons are invariably drawn. Some of it is about the realities of seeing a touring version of a show – the set will never be as impressive as in a West End house, but the design here really does come up short on a couple of occasions and the sound quality was shocking in parts. Elsewhere, some performances left me disappointed especially as the casting decisions don’t always seem to have hit the mark. It feels a little churlish to criticise Faye Brookes for not being Sheridan Smith, but her Elle doesn’t capture the loveability that is needed to keep the show swinging through its slower parts and to keep the audience invested. Gareth Gates takes on the thankless role of Warner very much against type and I’m not sure I bought him as the heartbreaker. Both sounded excellent though."
1666,1666,Ought To Be Clowns,08/09/2016,mag9l,The Plough and the Stars, National,"Gruelling Irish dramas seem to pop up with some regularity at the National and Sean O’Casey’s The Plough and the Stars is just the latest to test my patience. The play is considered O’Casey’s masterpiece but given that I didn’t last past the interval of Juno and the Paycock here a few years ago, I didn’t enter the Lyttelton with the highest of expectations. And nor did it meet them. Howard Davies and Jeremy Herrin’s revival may possess poignant resonance in marking the centenary of the crucial event it builds up to – the Easter Rising of 1916 – but it also feels like it takes a century to get round to it. A large ensemble populate the tenement building at the heart of the community featured here and they all get their chance to have their considerable say."
1667,1667,Ought To Be Clowns,09/03/2016,mag9l,End of the Rainbow, Churchill Bromley,"The enduring legacy of Judy Garland may be considered the preserve of gay men of a certain age but but what Peter Quilter’s End of the Rainbow, a play with songs rather than an all-out musical, reminds us is that hers was a tragedy in which all of our increasingly celebrity-obsessed society is complicit. The play is set in the months leading up to her death in 1969, as desperate to pay off her debtors, her new young fiancé and manager Mickey Deans signed her up for a five week run of cabaret shows at The Talk of the Town though as became clear to see, Garland’s struggles made it a very difficult time. With the press against her, willing her on to ever more scandalous deeds, friends deserting her as her drug dependencies also pushed away four husbands, and a career that was nosediving as a result of all this drama, Deans was banking on this being the comeback of all comebacks. But Quilter shows us through a number of scenes, that the extremities of her behaviour impossibly strained the relationships in her life, even with her devoted Brighton-based pianist Anthony, her body and mind warped by endless years of being a part of the fame game and unable to deal with being chewed up and spat out by the Hollywood machine. Paul Taylor Mills and Mercury Theatre, Colchester’s touring production of End of the Rainbow, in association with The Belgrade Theatre, is blessed with a fiercely strong performance from Lisa Maxwell as Garland, an almost disturbing and distressing portrayal of a woman ravaged by addiction, desperate for love and willing to make do with attention. Her slight frame trembles and quivers, even in the lighter moments of her sharp-edged one-liners, and in her determination to get her own way, whether to get the pills or to get off them in one of her more lucid moments, Maxwell is utterly committed and highly watchable. She’s also a skilled performer, delivering impassioned versions of the songs that Garland made her own – among them ‘The Trolley Song’, ‘Come Rain or Come Shine’, an extraordinary ‘The Man Who Got Away’ – Tom Turner’s musical direction full of brassy ballsiness and tender heart too. And as the men in her life, Sam Attwater gives a good account of Deans, making us believe he could well have loved her as well as seeing his meal ticket in her as he struggles to keep a lid on the pill bottles. And Gary Wilmot is entertaining as the gay pianist who worships her, would do anything for her, if only she would say yes. Daniel Buckroyd’s direction keeps the play moving with a great sense of pace, aided by the smooth transitions of David Shields’ design, from the dated grandeur of the hotel suite to the gaudy glitz onstage at the club. And as Maxwell inhabits Garland for one last time in the stirring rendition of ‘Somewhere Over The Rainbow’, it is impossible not be moved. If she doesn’t quite scale the heights that Tracie Bennett reached in the same role six years ago, it is only because that was a once-in-a-lifetime performance. This is a welcome return for End of the Rainbow. "
1668,1668,Ought To Be Clowns,13/06/2010,Ian,The Panel, Women,"The Panel is the only play in the season which does not feature a woman on stage. It stars all five male members of the ensemble in an interview panel situation, they’ve just spent three days interviewing a woman-only shortlist for a job and need to appoint, but with various deadlines fast approaching and a range of individual agendas at play, it is not a clear-cut decision. I wasn’t a fan of the gender politics on display here. It felt a little reductive, suggesting no progress in the corporate world, ultimately tarring all men with the same brush and certainly I didn’t feel as if it had anything new to say. It did raise the interesting point though that only one of the women who was interviewed would have made the sift if it hadn’t have been a women-only shortlist, raising the question about the effectiveness of positive discrimination, something Ann Widdecombe’s interjections in the verbatim section focuses on: it has to be on merit, she says. Simon Chandler’s ponderous David and Tom Mannion’s thoroughly old-school Maurice were the funniest characters, but all the men did well in trying to give life to these rather stereotypical sexist businessmen. Aware of political correctness and the need to appear onboard with it, Oliver Chris’ moderator Chris in particular was hyper-aware of this “We can’t give her feedback that says she didn’t get it because she was too good!”."
1669,1669,Ought To Be Clowns,18/05/2015,mag9l,Sense of an Ending, Theatre503,"Cecilia Carey’s set design for Sense of an Ending at Theatre503 is surely one of the best of the year so far – deceptively simple to behold but wonderfully inventive and empathetic to the story it houses. Multi-coloured panels in a false wall initially suggest the evocative beauty of stained glass but as the play progresses, they are sculpted by Joshua Pharo’s lighting into conduits into the past, compelling reminders of the present and suggestions of the future looming over the characters of Ken Urban’s Rwanda-set play. All three time periods are important but it is the past that is most significant. It’s 1999 and two Hutu nuns stand accused of aiding and/or abetting a massacre in their church in the 1994 genocide that decimated this African country’s population. An American journalist, haunted by his own demons, arrives at the prison they’re being held at to throw attention on their case but in a nation where the healing process has scarcely begun, notions of truth and reconciliation are hard to come by as conflicting accounts cast doubt on their presumed innocence.  There’s a dark, sinuous power to Jonathan O’Boyle’s production which never lets us forget that in times of turmoil, the truth rarely comes in the stark black and white that the hopelessly naïve journalist craves, and that an academic understanding of the issues is no replacement for the deep-seated reality of ethnic conflict. Urban’s writing gives us both, eventually, Ben Onwukwe’s writer has to unravel a fair bit of expositionary dialogue but the pay-off comes in two devastatingly effective scenes of uncompromising starkness. First, a survivor of the massacre recounts his tale in all its appalling brutality – abandoned by the international community, turned on by his own countrymen, it’s a necessarily hard but vitally important piece of storytelling by Kevin Golding that leaves us reeling. And then late on, the question of forgiveness raises its head and due to the brilliant performances of Lynette Clarke and Akiya Henry as the emotionally complex sisters, the final moments have an enormous and illustrative power that lingers long in the mind. "
1670,1670,Ought To Be Clowns,09/12/2011,Ian,You Me Bum Bum Train 2011, plus news about extension,"Are things ever as good as the first time? Well, it is usually different to say the least and so it was with the latest incarnation of You Me Bum Bum Train which has taken up residence in a disused office block on New Oxford Street for the next few weeks. I was able to ride the Train last year due to a completely random piece of booking on the Barbican website whilst snowed in at my parents’ house, I knew nothing of the show and it was pure chance that I happened to pick up tickets for what was apparently the fastest-ever selling show for the Barbican. That first experience was absolutely sensational, completely unlike anything I had ever done before and it initially thrilled and terrified me in equal measure before the sense of sheer wonderment set in at what I had been through. The Train is a site-specific, interactive, personal journey that you take on your own through a series of experiences, encounters and adventures, populated by literally hundreds of volunteers, which range from the surreal to the exhilarating to the challenging to the everyday. Taken together over a non-stop 40 minute period, they form an unparalleled adventure which has to be one of the most liberating things you will ever do. Participants are honour-bound not to reveal the details of the show in order not to detract from the mystery that surrounds it – a tough job for a reviewer! – and ultimately that forms part of the beauty of entering this world – the unexpectedness of it all is what makes it so much fun. For me as a second-time-round guy, I have to say I absolutely relished the opportunity to re-enter the world of co-creators and directors Kate Bond and Morgan Lloyd’s endlessly fascinating imaginations – they’ve been doing this for 8 years now – and the amount of fore-knowledge that I had, in terms of the types of things I’d had to do last time round, meant that I was a lot more relaxed about the whole shebang. I managed to work myself into a bit of a state with nerves first time round and it took me a little time to get settled into it all, which in a 40 minute show has a fair impact, so it was good to be able to tumble head-first through the rabbit-hole and not be near-paralysed with fear. (It also meant I also got the delicious little red-herring-flavoured nod to last year that is in the stairwell by the first waiting room.) That said, the irony is is that there’s nothing to be afraid of at all. Yes, it is an interactive show and so the more you put into it yourself, the more rewarding the experience becomes for you, but the environment which is created throughout is so supportive and warm that there’s no need for inhibitions here and so much to be gained by just letting go. Even if, especially if, you think this is not the type of show for you, I would urge you to be a bit daring and take the chance as it really is thoroughly enjoyable and revelatory in the way that it pushes you to do things you never thought were possible (and I’m not exaggerating, once again I found myself doing things I’d never dreamed of – and so did some of the people I interacted with, I’d wager!) Tickets were predictably like gold-dust and vamooshed in mere minutes, but you have a second chance to take part as a ticket lottery for dates in January will open next week – details below. I was a little worried that I wouldn’t enjoy myself as much as last time but my fears were genuinely unfounded as it remained to be one of the most inventive, breath-taking and awesome theatrical experiences I have ever had the privilege to take part in: I cannot urge you enough to take a punt on You Me Bum Bum Train – if only so that I have someone else to talk to about it. (In that respect, hanging around the bar afterwards is great fun as it means you can share your experiences with other participants, so I’d recommend getting a drink or two and comparing notes!)  
You Me Bum Bum Train Extension Dates: the ride continues… After the massively high demand for the original run of this year’s production of You Me Bum Bum Train (80,000 applications for 1,000 tickets), the team behind the show are pleased to announce an extension into the New Year on selected dates from 5th-15th January. Recognising the difficulties that the ticketing website had first time round, a different system will be utilised to allocate places – a ticket lottery. From Monday 12th December, a form will be available from the Run Riot website where you will be asked to fill out an email address and the date you wish to ride the train. The lottery will be open for five days, after which people will be randomly selected by a computer and asked to select the time they want/is available. Entrants may only enter the lottery the once to ensure as fair and equal a distribution as possible."
1671,1671,Ought To Be Clowns,29/10/2017,Ian,Imagine This, Union,"The West End production of Imagine This lasted for barely a month in 2008, so it usually one of the first shows named when it comes to lists of notorious flops. Which might explain, at least partly, why it has taken nearly a decade for anyone to go near the show again, that honour going to first-time director Harry Blumenau who is now mounting the musical at the Union Theatre, in a well-cast production seeking to reassess that reputation. For me, as a first-timer to the show, it didn’t feel hard to see why it didn’t succeed. Glenn Berenbeim’s grimly stoic book is set in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 where a group of actors are trying to lift spirits by staging a play. And not just any play, it’s the story of the siege of Masada, a historical act of Jewish resistance and thereby flicking the v-sign to the Nazis. But Berenbeim attempts to gild the lily by throwing a would-be epic romance which ultimately cheapens the narrative fatally. There’s a chilling power to the resonance that emerges between the ‘Hail Caesars’ of the play and the ‘Heil Hitlers’ of real life that keeps interrupting, but Berenbeim allows no time for the development of his characters before they are submerged into the world of the play-within-the-play, a balance that never gets corrected throughout the show. And Shuki Levy’s score doesn’t do enough to differentiate between the two worlds either, despite the many influences it could have drawn on, opting instead for a monotonous flow of generic bland balladry.  So against all this, Blumenau and his company have a real battle on their hands. And at times, they succeed in showing what a show it could be. The soaring full-cast harmonies on tracks like ‘Imagine This’ are stunning, and Justin Williams’ design captures the poor theatre aesthetic perfectly. And the likes of Nick Wyschna as director Daniel, Lauren James Ray as his daughter Rebecca and Shaun McCourt’s resistance fighter Adam deliver emotionally committed performances."
1672,1672,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2015,mag9l,Portia Coughlan, Old Red Lion,"Quite how Marina Carr’s Portia Coughlan hasn’t been seen here since its 1996 debut seems scarcely credible, such is the power of Bronagh Logan’s revival for Aria Entertainment at the Old Red Lion. Caught in the hinterland between rural Irish family drama and something altogether more ghostly, it is a ferociously punchy play, akin to dropping rock after rock into the still water of the nearby bog, watching more and more ripples clash against each other and wrecking the calm. Portia is turning 30 but she’s already hitting the whiskey before 10am, such is her disillusionment with life as wife to a dull husband and mother of three. She tries to find succour at the bottom of any number of bottles and in numerous affairs with the men of the village but she’s irrevocably haunted by the death of her twin brother some 15 years past and try as she might, she can’t resist the siren call that seems to be calling her to him. Though the title character is very much at the centre of the play, and Susan Stanley’s fiercely captivating performance is full of unruly spirit and barefoot abandon, Carr’s story is about the community as a whole and the structure of the play reflects this, deploying a little narrative tricksiness to show how incestuously close all these friends and neighbours are with all their shared secrets and lies, which naturally spill forth to explain something of Portia’s disenchantment with life. Veronica Quilligan and James Holmes form a cracking double act as friends of the family, Anne Kent’s wheelchair-bound harridan is marvellously monstrous and as the men dancing to Portia’s beat, Conan Sweeny’s wisecracking barman, Alan Devally’s devilishly handsome lover and Ben Mulhern’s too-tolerant husband all cultivate the sense of wanting, needing, more than she could ever give them."
1673,1673,Ought To Be Clowns,16/06/2013,Ian,The School for Scandal, Park Theatre,       
1674,1674,Ought To Be Clowns,10/04/2010,Ian,The Pirates of Penzance, Wilton’s Music Hall,"So just a few days after seeing the touring production of Pirates in Brighton, another production appears in London: for such a fan of this show as I am, heaven! This particular Pirates of Penzance is a transfer of the all-male Union Theatre production from last year which has been remounted at the atmospheric Wilton’s Music Hall in the East End, one of my favourite venues in London. And in a blatant attempt to make me fall yet further in love with the idea, preview ticket prices were set at £10, less than half the regular ticket-price. To be honest, it did take me a little time to adjust to the different production: having seen (and completely loved) a highly professional version by an opera company so recently, this presents an interesting alternative take which was no less professional. What it perhaps lacks in the vocal side of things, it more than makes up for with a much greater sense of the comic potential contained within Gilbert & Sullivan’s work. And what makes this such an effective take on this show is that despite the conceit of an all-male cast, it actually has very little impact on the production itself. It is played as straight as a die, no (well, hardly any) camping it up or tipping the wink and so this becomes a refreshing new look at a musical already full of natural wit and genuine comedy, rather than being painfully self-aware and post-modern. Accompanied by Chris Mundy’s excellent piano playing, the ensemble of 18 create a rich sound that fills this old-time music hall which feels like the perfect venue for G+S. Adapting such a lyrical piece for a different (and much more echoey)theatrical space clearly has its issues and it seems to have been done largely successfully here, the four sisters in particular combine voices to a surprisingly beautiful effect. I would only advise putting Fred Broom’s Major General further forward throughout his eponymous number as much of his lyrical content did not travel well to the back of the hall which is a shame as he delivers the song with real panache. Elsewhere, Alan Richardson is at times breathtaking good and remarkably consistent with both speaking and singing voices as the soprano Mabel, Russell Whitehead’s slave of duty Frederic is strongly and manfully played and Samuel J Holmes comes close to stealing the show as nurse Ruth, gamely dowdying up in a cast of beautiful young things. Costumes have been nicely realised with a minimum of fuss and frippery, simple white linens abound and it looks effective. With a mostly bare stage, focus is maintained on the vocal and choreographical skills on show (the policemen’s dance moves along with their portable moustaches were a personal favourite) and there’s some nice use of the venue’s idiosyncracies, the maidens arrive from the back of the balcony so we hear them long before we see them and playing “With Cat-Like Tread…” in the dark with the groups of police and pirates spread throughout the whole hall, barely illuminated by a few torches was a brilliant touch. It was most educational seeing it with a group of people who had no previous with this play. Where I thought they had skipped through a few plot points too quickly (i.e. establishing the importance of Frederic’s sense of duty), most everyone seemed to have little problem in following the story and loving the whole show, proving my assertion from earlier in the week that this really is one of the best Gilbert+Sullivan shows for novices. Of course it is helped by productions which are of as high quality as this one, at once a pleasingly faithful yet delightfully irreverent take on this old stalwart. Nice review – note the Major General could not be understood from even the 2nd row, a real shame."
1675,1675,Ought To Be Clowns,25/04/2017,Ian,Spring Offensive, Clapham Omnibus,"Victoria Willing’s Spring Offensive is a spikily fresh take on the First World War and its enduring legacy, a bold move for the Clapham Omnibus and one which does pay some dividends. The theatre has been transformed into April’s Bed and Breakfast, ‘the best on the Somme’ it would have you believe, and Grace Smart’s clever design of cosy but threadbare furnishings instantly lets you know this is a somewhat idle boast. Expat April has spent more than 20 years in Northern France, having identified her niche and capitalising on the never-ending stream of tourists who visit the battlefields of the Somme to pay their respects. Familiarity has bred contempt though and as the customers have disappeared, her frustrations have turned onto two long-term guests of her establishment, Tom and Pam, and things finally bubble over the course of a long spring evening, a Spring Awakening if you will… There’s a brutal blackness to the comedy in Willing’s writing that is quite something to behold, a desperation to these three lost souls who cling to each other simply because there’s no-one else and despite the scathing nature of Willing’s own April, unable to cope without them, barely able to tolerate them. Her plotting teases interestingly at issues of mental health and roles for older women in society and could push even further than it does."
1676,1676,Ought To Be Clowns,06/01/2012,Ian,Backstage Pass (pilot) Inside Fanny,,"Ain’t Twitter grand. All sorts of randomness appears on Twitter, peccadilloes exposed, truths revealed and a whole lot of guff expounded about any range of subjects. But sometimes little gems appear (and not just the lettuces) as it was with this YouTube clip that was pointed out to me. It’s a spoof South Bank-style documentary, following the fortunes of an actress ‘up-and-coming’ as described by only her, and her disastrous experiences in the company of a newly opened show. It was actually put together by the cast of When Did You Last See My Mother which played at the Trafalgar Studios 2 last year, assumably for a bit of a laugh and though it is perhaps a little overlong, I’d say it is worth the watch. It feels quite Victoria Wood-like (I think it most reminds me of a backstage episode of Acorn Antiques) and is often quite amusing in the way it contrasts the accounts of her God-given talent and the forced smiles of her co-stars as they are grudgingly interviewed, and the realities of just how shit she is as revealed by hilarious ‘candid’ encounters with the same colleagues as she continually screws up and is exposed for the chancer she is. The main attraction – and reason for it being pointed my way – was the presence of Mr Sam Swainsbury (though I generally disapprove of the haircut here), and there is a fabulous moment of ARMS towards the end (17:05) but they all do well. Antonia Finlay as the flakey Fanny is brilliantly deluded, Laurence Dobiesz is funny throughout as the obsessed hairdresser and chief enabler and Abigail Cruttenden cameos well as a disbelieving co-star. My only disappointment was that Harry Melling remained behind the camera as the narrator/presenter though his vocal work is wryly amusing from start to finish."
1677,1677,Ought To Be Clowns,07/03/2011,Ian,Honest, Queen’s Head Pub,"First staged at the Mailcoach pub in Northampton under the aegis of Royal & Derngate, Northampton followed by a highly successful run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, DC Moore’s 40 minute monologue Honest now arrives in London. As the set-up is simply a man talking in a pub, so this show has actually been playing pubs rather than theatres, in London it has taken up residence in the Queen’s Head near Piccadilly Circus and right next to the Piccadilly Theatre where Grease is currently playing. Honest starts as Dave takes his seat in the pub alongside us, takes a sip from his half of bitter and starts to talk about the prevalence of lying and deceit in all aspects of modern life, something which irks him something rotten as he’s a guy who believes that honesty is the best policy whether it concerns family, work colleagues or complete strangers. He regales us with amusing razor-sharp anecdotes about the inanities of office life in an obscure government department, full of over-promoted idiots and endless office celebrations and how sickened he is by having become complicit in not telling people what he really thinks of them. But absolute honesty comes at a price and things come to a head, as they are wont to do, at a drunken work night out when he finally snaps and tells his boss exactly what he thinks of him. He then sets off on a booze-fuelled stagger through South London to find his nephew and be faced with some home truths. This is absolutely stunning stuff: Trystan Gravelle is utterly convincing as Dave with his rumpled-suit, 5 o’clock shadow and piercingly direct style: blessed with a natural raconteur’s gift, it makes Honest completely entrancing, the 40 minutes passed in the blink of an eye and I could easily have sat listening to him for hours. Moore’s writing is frequently so bleak in its outlook and darkly cynical about everything and anything that crosses Dave’s path whether it is a child’s drawing of a tiger, the pervasiveness of meaningless management-speak, work nights out, Australian bar staff, private education, yuppies in Clapham, nothing escapes his withering gaze or even worse in some cases, but it never gets too “Grumpy Old Men” in its misanthropy. This is largely thanks to Gravelle’s performance which always keeps things on the right side of wry bemusement. Even at its bleakest moments, he employs a lightness of touch which roots Dave as a normal bloke driven a bit mad by things rather than an out-and-out psychopath and keeps him intensely likeable. That said, there was also a neat touch of a copy of Bret Easton Ellis’ novel American Psycho on the table with Dave’s phone and drink: his distaste for much of 80s pop music and the hints at a casually violent streak feel like they could be distantly descended from the sociopathic Patrick Bateman, yet it is the most subtle of suggestions here."
1678,1678,Ought To Be Clowns,03/02/2012,Ian,The Winter’s Tale, Propeller at the Crucible,"The second part of Propeller’s current double bill is The Winter’s Tale and much as we did last year for The Comedy of Errors, Boycotting Trends and I (with bonus @3rdspearcarrier) trekked up to Sheffield to catch it early in the substantial tour that follows. It was a little sad but true that Henry V failed to live up to my (sky-high) expectations so I’d aimed for a better job of managing them this time round for this ‘problem play’. Sicilia is all moon-lit stark, metallic edges, the dark candle-lit atmosphere matching the troubled mind of Leontes, whose tortured jealousy sends him into a frenzy that challenges a lifelong friendship, the will of the gods and the lives of his children and his dear wife Hermione. Robert Hands give his Leontes an anger that subtly builds rather than one that defines his character and thus we feel for him even in his most fevered moments and always see the husband and father that is being lost in the red mist of jealousy – this in turn makes it (slightly) more believable that Hermione might forgive him. By contrast, Bohemia becomes a music festival of free love, flowers and fun. Most of Propeller’s trademark innovation comes into play here with Autolycus becoming an Iggy Pop-like cult figure complete with a back-up group of singing and dancing sheep, Beyoncé dance-offs and ridiculous disguises amusing all. In this world, the laughs come aplenty and the romance most sweetly captured by Ben Allen as Perdita whose connection with Finn Hanlon’s Florizel runs deeper than any class structure. The shift back to Sicilia for the final act really does capture the heart of this interpretation which wears sadness heavy in its heart. The reconciliations of family and friends long torn asunder are beautifully played, but we’re not allowed to forget Paulina’s raw grief and the very last note is one of melancholy grace, calling back to the storytelling methods used throughout and making complete sense of them, and consequently packing the most unexpected emotional punch."
1679,1679,Ought To Be Clowns,13/11/2011,Ian,The Firewatchers, Old Red Lion,"The Firewatchers, a new play by young playwright Laura Stevens, offers a neat counterpoint to the jingoistic male-dominated Three Days in May, by presenting an altogether different experience of the Second World War, from the perspective of two very different women stationed for the night on an East London factory rooftop in 1942. Eastender Jean works in a munitions factory whilst Catharine is a wealthy society wife but they find themselves sharing a long night shift as firewatchers, on the alert for fires started by German incendiary devices. But though the two women come to realise they might have more in common than they realise, Stevens does not make the mistake of drawing too close a parallel. Wartime saw great change beginning to ripple through society in terms of both class and gender divides but it was by no means instant. What Stevens adroitly draws our attention to, by cleverly placing this well after the Blitz had nominally finished, is just how differently the impact of war played out on women of different class as we find out how each woman has come to end up on this rooftop. Directed by Katie Lewis, Abigail Thaw makes a strong impact as the cocktail-swigging Catharine, her cut-glass vowels, heels and designer outfit eminently unsuitable for work but presenting a facade of never-say-die spirit (accompanied by a bottle of gin in her handbag) and rather glad to be out of her empty house. This is contrasted by the wearied Jean – Michelle Tate bringing a raw spikiness – doing her bit despite having worked all day in the factory and completely bemused by her new companion. There are some lovely moments as the ‘novelty value’ of women doing men’s work is discussed from their differing viewpoints as is the new experience of wearing trousers, the chitchat revealing interesting snippets of their lives but also providing small flashpoints as the social chasm between them means they often rub each other up the wrong way, especially with the preconceptions they carry – in some cases fully justified. Stevens also casts a light on the grim realities of living through a war. Jean’s house suffered bomb damage months ago but they’re still making do with a tarpaulin pulled over the gap in their front wall; the sense of regular life being completely on hold as they think about their menfolk and the social lives they would otherwise be living, Catharine’s brave face only slipping when she’s alone despite craving companionship. It also looks at the fears of people that victory was by no means a foregone conclusion and the power of contrasting propaganda messages depending on the desperation of their circumstances."

1681,1681,Ought To Be Clowns,05/06/2014,mag9l,Symphony of a Missing Room, LIFT 2014,"Lundahl & Seitl’s Symphony of a Missing Room was my first sampling of 2014’s LIFT festival and it is hard to imagine it being bettered. The Archive of the Forgotten and Remembered sounds like a Doctor Who episode in the making and in some ways, it was a bit like an adventure in space and time. If you’ve booked and not been, I strongly advise looking away now; if you haven’t booked, it is sadly sold out but I’d recommend trying for returns as it makes for an amazing experience.  The Royal Academy’s Summer Exhibition is the venue, our small group gets ushered in for a sneak preview of a show that hasn’t yet opened, and then the journey proper begins as headphones are placed on our heads, followed by blindfolds which don’t quite block out everything, and we’re lead on a fantastically, wonderfully disorienting experience, the like of which I don’t think I’ve quite ever had before. Seeing as much theatre as I do, it’s a remarkable thing to be so transported by something, especially in the overcrowded and often underwhelming immersive market. Hands as light as feathers guide us around, voices as soft as gossamer wings usher in instructions, as we travel along, well, who knows where. Somehow we seem to cover all sorts as the terrain underfoot changes in texture, we end up outside, in lifts, in tunnels, in vaults, temperatures alter dramatically and sound effects add their own confusion as it becomes near-impossible to work out where we’ve gone, where we are, where we’re going. "
1682,1682,Ought To Be Clowns,17/10/2017,Ian,Venus in Fur, Theatre Royal Haymarket,"What a charged moment for Venus in Fur to open into. As the fallout from the Harvey Weinstein revelations continues to reverberate around social media and perhaps even society at large, a play about the sexual dynamic between an actress and and a director and the erotic power play that emerges out of her audition feels…challenging. Intriguingly written, thought-provokingly staged and superbly acted, it nevertheless left something niggling at me. David Ives’ play was extremely well received off- and on-Broadway at the beginning of this decade and it has a tricksy cleverness to its meta-textual construction and surfeit of theatrical in-jokes. A brash young playwright has spent a long day auditioning for his adaptation of Venus in Furs, an 1869 novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, who literally put the masochism in S&M. Arriving late and swearing like a trooper, Vanda pleads for the chance to be heard but as an eventual audition becomes a read-through, little is as it seems. In Natalie Dormer and David Oakes’ hands, directed by Patrick Marber, the continual fluctuations in the relationship between actor and director, man and woman, sub and dom, are gripping throughout. To give any details is to risk spoilers and if possible, I’d go in knowing as little as possible. That said, I don’t think it is saying too much to acknowledge a phenomenal performance from Dormer whose magnetic stage presence is undeniable throughout the shifting terrain of the play."
1683,1683,Ought To Be Clowns,30/03/2017,mag9l,Custody, Ovalhouse,"One of the most appallingly striking statistics around police brutality in the UK is that there has not been a single prosecution for homicide for a death in custody for over 30 years and a disproportionate number – 147 to be precise – of those deaths have been BAME victims. But where the Black Lives Matter movement has gained real traction in the US, stories like these still slip by too easily unnoticed on these shores, And combined with his own experiences of the problematic stop and search system here, it is this which inspired Urbain Hayo (aka Urban Wolf) to create Custody.  It’s an undoubtedly powerful raison d’être and one which has been curiously, deliberately, filtered here through writer Tom Wainwright’s perspective as a white, middle-class man who, one assumes, hasn’t suffered the indignities of stop and search. It’s an approach that broadens the scope of the story from the directly personal to a more universal world-view but in doing so, also mutes just a little of the fury and tragedy that is felt by the family of Brian – a successful young businessman, black – whose flash car attracts the attention of the police with devastating results.  Director Gbemisola Ikumelo melds a highly stylised approach with more conventional storytelling to make the work stand out. So the company sometimes speak as one, sometimes their dialogue overlaps in cascading waves; Cindy Claes’ movement has them wandering lost in grief as we walk in or reenacting the police procedure that leads to the fatal incident of positional asphyxiation; Phil Newman’s hugely inventive design brings together the domestic and the dramatic with real flair; and Sekrit’s compositions provide a gritty sound design that is suitably ominous."
1684,1684,Ought To Be Clowns,17/07/2011,Ian,Hundreds and Thousands, Soho Theatre,"Hundreds and Thousands is a new play by Lou Ramsden which has just now finished its run at the Soho Theatre. Set in the new Upstairs Studio (which we had a first experience of during the run of Charged plays), the play centres on Lorna, whose biological clock is ticking so loudly, she is beginning to lose hope. When she meets Allan at a speed-dating night, she sees a chance to finally secure a husband and family and so she quickly moves into his secluded farmhouse. Though she’s happy, her brother is much more sceptical and rightly so as it turns out, Allan has a terrible secret locked away in the basement. Most women would run away if they found out that their beloved had a young woman enslaved in their household, kept in chains, but not Lorna. Her desperation to hold onto her man, any man, means that she willingly submits to Allan’s manipulations and buries any misgivings in his explanations of how Tiggy came to be with them and why she is treated this way. I haven’t had quite so strong a reaction against a play in some time. Ramsden wilfully provokes the audience with some very dark scenes, especially those involving the torture of Tiggy, but the accompanying plot does not have the necessary intelligence in order to justify such an approach. The basic premise of selfish desires overriding common decency is frankly objectionable given the circumstances in which it is placed here, Lorna’s dilemma is just nowhere near plausible. And Ramsden wants to have her cake and eat it by placing such beautiful wordplay in Tiggy’s mouth despite her apparently suffering from learning difficulties: either she is clever enough to escape or she is not."
1685,1685,Ought To Be Clowns,01/06/2015,mag9l,The Clockmaker’s Daughter, Landor,"Described as a musical faerytale, Michael Webborn and Daniel Finn’s The Clockmaker’s Daughter aims to create the feeling of a story from the Brothers Grimm but in actual fact, has come up with an astonishingly assured piece of original musical theatre. Set in the fictional Irish town of Spindlewood, the story delves into the myth behind the statue of a young girl in the town square – a tale of grieving inventor Abraham and of Constance, a girl not like the others, and how she touches the lives of the townspeople around her despite their pettiness and prejudices.  David Shields’ remarkable design work is some of the best the Landor has ever seen, an all-encompassing vision that properly transforms the theatre and transports the audience to a different, magical, place. Cleverly conceived and carefully constructed, its various pieces work…well…like clockwork. And this ambition is matched in the scope of the writing and the score, combining the epic with the intimate, the emotional with the entertaining, the folkloric with the universal in what emerges as a deeply moving tale. It works so well because Webborn and Finn capture so much of what makes a fairytale tick, whilst also adding its own comic spin to elevate it. So Jo Wickham’s should-be grotesque Ma’Riley is actually hilarious whilst being horrific (the bit with the mixed-up names is still making me chuckle now); and Constance’s first journey into the real world is highly amusing as she slowly becomes accustomed to human habits but Jennifer Harding ensures we’re always laughing with and not at her in what is an awesomely impressive performance. And because it is funny, it becomes charming. And because it becomes charming, it also ends up heartbreaking. The grief that fuels Lawrence Carmichael’s clockmaker is more potent for being (relatively) unexplored and the ambiguity of his feelings towards Constance hint darkly; the witty whirligig of small-town life turns affectingly nasty once their small-mindedness is revealed; and with the outstanding Alan McHale as the superbly delightful Will, there’s a believable love story that you can’t help but root for, and one which cleverly keeps us on our toes throughout as his and Harding’s palpable chemistry dances across the stage. The work that has gone into every aspect of Robert McWhir’s production is phenomenal and it is in the smaller details that this shines through – the time delay on the sound effect of things falling into the well, the workmanship on a complex model that only remains in the background, the simple fact that Robbie O’Reilly’s choreography is used solely for when the townsfolk are actually dancing, the rounded characterisations from every one of the 20-strong company. So much works so well that the world of Spindlewood is pretty much irresistible from top to bottom."
1686,1686,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,10, VAULT Festival,"Stuck at Six? Try 10. The truth is, sadly, that there are endless women whose histories have been misrepresented, or not even told but thankfully, there does seem to be a desire to tell those stories right now, accompanied by an appetite for them to be seen. Six is nominated for five Oliviers, Emilia has transferred into the West End and other shows at the VAULT such as The Limit have also got in on the act. And why wouldn’t this be the case. Pretty much half of history has gone untold, unexplored, under-represented in our textbooks and in our culture, so it stands to reason that there’s acres of potential here. Lizzie Milton’s 10 identifies ten such women from across the centuries and across many disciplines, from medieval Mercian queens to Second World War heroines, abolitionists to painters, this is our real history. In the sparse, elongated space of the Cavern, Nastazja Somers’ production is high on atmosphere, Nicola Chang’s almost hypnotic sound design moulding the mood, Rajiv Pattani’s lighting eyecatchingly supple in spotlighting the ever-shifting ensemble. And just as there are ten women, there’s ten different styles of telling a story, direct audience contact sits next to expressive movement sequences, choral support contrasts with the solo voice, all five actors deeply impress in their many ways. Commonalities emerge, not least the all-too-predictable ways in which men disappoint, husbands, brothers, colleagues. And there’s something deeply moving about their different response to how they’re remembered (or not).To give them their due, they are Æthelflæd and Mary Prince (Pamela Jikiemi), Princess Caraboo and Noor Inayat Khan (Lydia Bakelmun), Constance Markievicz and Mary Seacole (Naomi Knox), Joan Clarke and Gwen John (Beth Eyre) and Ada Lovelace and Brenda Procter (Rebecca Crankshaw)."
1687,1687,Ought To Be Clowns,17/11/2013,Ian,, Propeller at Yvonne Arnaud,"Propeller’s 2013/14 tour sees them revive their productions ofThe Comedy of Errors and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, with the latter kicking things off in a few venues this winter before the former joins it in rep early next year. The all-male Shakespeare company has rightfully garnered considerable praise for its innovative ensemble-driven approach to the Bard’s works but returning to this interpretation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, previously seen in 2003 and 2009, sees them lose a little of that special magic that they have previously brought to bear. Located in a Victorian attic of sorts, the story of the course of true love is surprisingly leaden in a protracted first half which fails to reveal any real sense of purpose to Edward Hall’s production. The ducal court is dull with a criminally insipid Hippolyta, any character that does arrive in Will Featherstone’s performance is too little too late; there’s a quartet of curiously bloodless lovers, with only Dan Wheeler’s Helena really standing out; and the Rude Mechanicals are serviceable but little more. Joseph Chance’s Wizard of Oz-inspired Puck really is the saving grace with his supple slyness.  After the interval though, the comedy of the piece finally clicks into gear much more successfully, thanks to the braces-twanging antics of the lovers’ quarrel and a genuinely hilarious show-stopping strop from Alasdair Craig’s Flute in a chaotic take on Pyramus and Thisbe. Darrell Brockis and James Tucker’s warring Oberon and Titania (looking like refugees from Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake) bring a much-needed intensity which makes the fairy world the most compelling aspect of the show, Chris Myles’ Bottom amusing as he is kept prisoner by the smitten Titania. Not everything has to be about sex and violence but where the Globe and the Open Air Theatre respectively had huge success recently in playing up these elements, Propeller’s take feels slightly anaemic by not bringing anything else to the table. The music – customarily one of their strengths – fails to really anchor the play in either time or mood, the possibilities of Michael Pavelka’s set and its suspended chairs are rarely exploited to their fullest, and the show just misses much of the inventiveness with which this company often imbues such oft-seen characters. "
1688,1688,Ought To Be Clowns,12/02/2016,mag9l,Nell Gwynn, Apollo,"Jessica Swale’s Nell Gwynn took the Globe by storm last autumn so it was delightful news to hear that it would transfer into the West End. Sadly, it wasn’t able to hold onto Gugu Mbatha-Raw as its leading lady (nor the riotously scene-stealing Amanda Lawrence as her lady) but in finding Gemma Arterton to take over the role, Christopher Luscombe has ensured that the production makes the journey seamlessly as she is simply stunning in the role. "

1690,1690,Ought To Be Clowns,24/10/2012,Ian,Other Hands, Riverside Studios,"Though probably best known for her Royal Court hit Posh which transferred successfully into the West End this year, Laura Wade has been writing plays since 1996. But it is her 2006 play Other Hands which receives its first professional UK revival here at the Riverside Studios, fresh from a tour of the South Coast. Wade revisited the play to make a few updates to the text to reflect the technological advances and economic turmoil in the six years since it was written but at its heart, the central issues of Other Hands remain just as pertinent today. In a world of ever-increasing reliance on technology and the relentless pursuit of efficiency, are we in danger of not investing enough time in human relationships. To quote the playwright herself, what’s the use in 10,000 Facebook friends if you have no-one to give you a hug at the end of a rubbish day.  Wade explores this contemporary malaise in two ways through the central couple of Steve and Hayley. Together for 8 years and both professionally adept at fixing things, Steve is a freelance IT consultant who is perfectly happy to while away the hours on his PlayStation instead of looking for business as Hayley is a high-flying management consultant, earning enough to keep them both afloat. But they are barely treading water emotionally, and as problems start to manifest themselves physically too in the form of Steve’s ever-worsening RSI, they both start to look elsewhere.   What they both find is the possibility of greater connection. Pamela Banks’ brisk Hayley, sequestered in a world of corporate-speak, finds a way out through a serious flirtation with Greg, a married client, leading to a fantastically charged scene of great power. And James Dutton’s appealingly dopey Steve connects with the dippy Lydia, who is as desperate for human interaction as he, as fixing her computer leads to a deeper emotional intimacy, but one which manifests itself as genuine compassion as she turns her helping hand to Hayley too, as her hands also becomes afflicted."
1691,1691,Ought To Be Clowns,21/03/2016,mag9l,BU21, Theatre503,"How would you cope in a crisis? But no, really, if the sky came caving in on your world, if terrorist atrocities landed on your doorstep (or back garden), could you even begin to conceive of how you might react and respond. That’s what Stuart Slade’s BU21 asks of its six characters as they congregate in group therapy sessions for survivors, all dealing with the aftermath of a jumbo jet being shot down in the skies above West London with an anti-aircraft missile. One woman lost her mother, the news smashing into her world through a photo on Twitter; another saw a man still strapped into his seat crashing into her garden, still alive even if only for a couple of seconds; yet another has been horrifically burned by jet fuel, and so on. Their stories are told through interlinking monologues, details drawing their experiences inevitably closer but even as Slade gives us a searing account of tragedy close to home, he brilliantly skewers the way in which society, and particularly the media, tries to deal with it. OK being “entertained by a bunch of horrific human suffering”, challenging us about our preconceptions about the Muslim character Clive, advising when we’ve only just got 15 minutes to go. It’s an inspired way of interrogating the play and our own responses as we laugh guiltily, uncertainly, nervously.  For Dan Pick’s production nails the need that we have to laugh, to cry, in order to process, to rationalise, to keep on living the lives that have to continue. His company capture all the shaky energy of the verbatim style in which Slade writes and there’s not a weak link between them – Alex Forsyth’s arrogant but not irreproachable banker, Graham O’Mara’s slippery van driver, Thalissa Teixeira’s distraught yet still pragmatic daughter, Florence Roberts’ haunted witness. "
1692,1692,Ought To Be Clowns,06/07/2015,mag9l,wonder.land, Palace Theatre,"The lure of falling down the rabbit hole is one which has kept adaptations of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland appearing on a regular basis on screens and stages and the Manchester International Festival is no exception, commissioning this musical treatment with the National Theatre and Paris’ Théâtre du Châtelet. Composer Damon Albarn (no stranger to the MIF after Monkey and Dr Dee) and writer Moira Buffini’s thoroughly modern version – stylised wonder dot land – certainly has a unique take on the story but has the feeling of something of a work-in-progress perhaps, no bad thing as longer runs in London and Paris will follow this brief engagement at the Palace Theatre. Here, wonder.land is an online world, a virtual reality where people can escape the drudgery of their own lives or pretend to be someone completely different, for a little while at least. 12-year-old Aly is one such person, trying to hide from the bullies at school and the unhappiness at home by becoming Alice, her all-conquering avatar or online identity who accepts a mysterious quest as part of joining wonder.land. And in her journeying, she comes across variations on many of the characters we’ve come to know but viewed through a different prism, many of them being the avatars of other players, balefully reflecting their own insecurities.  Rae Smith’s cleverly constructed design work is the real star of the show here, delineating online from IRL with skilful help from Paule Constable’s lighting and augmenting the former with some sensational projection work from 59 Productions who make wonder.land a seductively vibrant place to become addicted to. But Buffini’s book tries to force in a whole lotta story into an already crowded world – the bullying, the separated parents, the rules of the online world and the various people in it, and that’s before the main twist comes with Aly’s Alice being stolen by her menacingly batty headteacher, also called Alice, who herself becomes addicted to the game. Despite the impressively dark beginnings, a scene of real online bullying has a chilling believability, the ways in which Aly’s trials are resolved follow a rather schematic track which lacks any real grounding in the realities of teen life but the determination to have ‘real life’ lessons come out of online activity overrides the more naturally fantastical elements of what is essentially a fairytale. The limited scope of Albarn’s score doesn’t help here either, lacking any concerted sense of identity to help guide us or any real stand-out musical moments in all honesty, despite some vivid staging choices by Rufus Norris, making good use of Javier De Frutos’ choreographic invention. Strong performances lift the material though – Anna Francolini is a vivacious villainess as the malevolent Ms Manxome with her Red Queen pretensions, Lois Chimimba’s Aly is a touching example of teenage angst and anxiety, Rob Compton displays a marvellous physicality as the wordless White Rabbit, and Sam Archer and Sam Mackay make a delightful duo of Dum and Dee. Golda Rosheuvel is excellent as Aly’s harried mother and Paul Hilton’s be-hatted dandy of a dad is well-performed if ultimately a little neutered by the requirements of the story. And it is always a joy to see Rosalie Craig onstage, especially as a live-action video-game character, though it is a shame she will not stay with the production into the autumn as she replaces Andrea Riseborough in As You Like It."

1694,1694,Ought To Be Clowns,29/04/2012,Ian,All Good Men / Thermidor, Finborough,"Trevor Griffiths’ All Good Men was originally a 1974 BBC Play for Today and though adapted for the stage the next year, has rarely been seen in the UK since then. Ever keen to sniff out hidden classics, the Finborough have revived it in their Sunday/Monday slot, paired with another short play by Griffiths – 1971’s Thermidor – rather neatly at a time when the morals of politicians are back in the headlines (but then, when are they never…) All Good Men centres on the political career of Edward Waite, a lifelong stalwart of the Labour party who rose from being a miner through union stewardship to holding positions in government, as a sharp young documentary maker prepares to make a television programme all about him, in advance of him accepting a peerage. But when Edward is taken ill, the arrival of his son and daughter proves less of a comfort and more of a challenge as the family albums and archives reveal a past that is not all that it seems and a family torn between idealism and political reality. David Weston (he of Covering McKellen fame and possessed of a fine head of hair) brings a fine haughtiness and self-assuredness to Waite, basking in the attention and reciting his past achievements almost by rote, convincing us of his political integrity whilst rising through his own rags to riches tale. But the limitations of the format, the show runs at under 80 minutes, means that Griffiths gives himself little room to manoeuvre an effective story or convincing characters around him. The chief conflict comes from his fiercely socialist son who believes his father has betrayed his roots and ideals and is not afraid of loudly proclaiming so, but though Ben Whybrow delivers some incredibly verbose passages well, there’s no escaping the fact there is no characterisation here just a fount of viewpoints. Likewise, Sophie Steer’s muted daughter makes little real impact, nor is allowed to, only Ben Deery’s (still in The Woman in Black so doing 10 shows a week altogether!) suave TV man Massingham really registered, the oily Winchester-educated arrogance slowly revealing his hidden agenda as Waite’s secrets start to tumble out. But because of the limitations of the piece, these ideas of whether a single misjudgement negates a lifetime of good work and what place idealism has in the rough and tumble of real politics, are not given enough room to breathe and develop beyond simple statements of position. Rania Jumaily’s direction too often sits statically in James Turner’s design, limited by sitting on top of the set for the main show at the Finborough, but the overall feel is of accomplishment rather than revelation."
1695,1695,Ought To Be Clowns,21/05/2017,Ian,Brimstone and Treacle, Hope Theatre,"Dennis Potter’s Brimstone and Treacle marks its 40th anniversary this year and so it’s as good a time as any to revive this dark drama that was so controversial on its release that the BBC banned it from its original Play For Today slot. It eventually played at Sheffield Crucible a year later and though it received a powerfully acted production (Tessa Peake-Jones, Rupert Friend) at the Arcola in 2012, Matthew Parker’s revival for his Hope Theatre feels perfectly poised to capitalise on its relevance to our fractured society. Though written and set in the late 70s, Potter’s depiction of far-right politics, racism and homophobia, religious intolerance feels horribly recognisable. The way in which one character rationalises his decision to join the National Front has chilling new currency in this post-Brexit world and the supercilious smile that another character occasionally bares to the audience reflects nothing so much as the arrogance of Nigel Farage. Potter’s dramatic form of evil is naturally much more timeless but you can’t help but draw the parallels here.  The evil that visits the North London suburban home of the Bates family comes in the form of Fergus Leathem’s Martin but in Parker’s production, there’s no questioning from whence he came. The flashes of red hot light (Tom Kitney) and simmering sound (Phil Matejschuk) underscore his demonic presence in a household that has stultified due to a tragic accident which has rendered a young woman severely injured and permanently bed-ridden (a superb Olivia Beardsley). And as he insinuates his way into their lives, true horror begins to unfold."
1696,1696,Ought To Be Clowns,18/10/2016,mag9l,The Wind in the Willows, Theatre Royal Plymouth,"Messrs Stiles, Drewe and Fellowes clearly have an affinity for working with each other as hot on the heels of Half A Sixpence, about to open in West End after a successful run in Chichester, comes another collaboration on a musical version of The Wind in the Willows. Destined for an as yet unconfirmed West End residency, it is currently touring from Plymouth to Salford and then on to Southampton, spreading its gentle, pastoral charms across the UK. And its charms are gentle, befitting any iteration of the beloved children’s novel by Kenneth Grahame. Julian Fellowes’ adaptation is faithful to that story and though the scale of Rachel Kavanaugh’s production is suitably large, it is also refreshingly simple. Peter McKintosh’s design is atmospheric but uncomplicated, playful rather than epic in its idyllic evocation of the British countryside, ably assisted by Aletta Collins’ languid choreography. The story begins in springtime (with the epic opener ‘Spring’, available to listen to here) as the inquisitive Mole goes exploring and on seeing the river for the first time ever, meets the kindly Rat. Their friendship is the bedrock of the show and is beautifully essayed by a (native) Northern Irish-accented Fra Fee and Thomas Howes – along with David Birrell’s seasoned Badger, their ‘A Friend Is Still A Friend’ stays the right of schmaltz to become genuinely affecting. The nominal star of the show is of course Toad, and he gets an appropriately brash performance from Rufus Hound, musically more contemporary than his compatriots in a rather adroit touch. His legal problems and dispossession of Toad Hall at the hands of the weasels, stoats and foxes aka The Wild Wooders (led by Neil McDermott’s wideboy Chief Weasel) are dynamic and vibrantly staged, Kavanaugh and co have clearly taken pains to avoid ever seeming too twee.  My favourite aspect of the show was the seasonal interludes. Structurally, they could be seen as problematic, essentially stopping the story to allow little cameos from some Andrews Sisters-esque swallows (‘One Swallow Does Not A Swallow Make’), some humbug-loving mice (‘The Wassailing Mice) and most memorably of all, the adorable hedgehog family (The Hedgehog’s Nightmare), but they’re done with such charm that they’re easily forgiven, especially when the latter rhyme ‘prickle’ with ‘vehicle’!  If I were to pick at anything, it would be the same issue that arose for me in Half A Sixpence with the lack of substantial roles for women. One might argue that the problem lies in the source material but given that these are adaptations, I don’t understand why more of an effort isn’t being made by the creatives to redress the balance. Here, Otter becomes Mrs Otter (an excellent Sophia Nomvete), but that still means only one of the six main characters is played by a woman and if we’re constantly looking back for inspiration for big new musicals, how else will things ever change (see also race, sexuality, disability…). That small cavil aside, The Wind in the Willows sees Stiles and Drewe, and indeed Fellowes, well within their comfort zone of the halcyon days of a storybook past, and they do a sterling job of it too. Rachel Kavanaugh’s astute direction gives it enough of an edge to keep it from being too Sunday-afternoon traditional, thus hopefully helping it to break through to the wider appeal it will need in a tough West End market. And if it is Hound taking the final bow, you can be sure it is the gorgeous warmth of Fra Fee’s Mole that denotes a leading man career in the ascendancy. Poop poop indeed!"
1697,1697,Ought To Be Clowns,15/02/2007,Ian,Avenue Q Lurvefest, Delfont Room,"I didn’t take notes as we were stood up for the show and it was the kind of night where I just wanted to soak it all up and enjoy it with my partner for once. It may not have been the most romantic way to spend Valentine’s, although I don’t think we ever thought it would be as it was frequently hysterical. So this is more a recollection of highlights from the evening than a full review. Incredibly, although perhaps predictably, the best bit of the night was a song I’d never heard before, ‘A Summer in Ohio’, from a musical called The Last Five Years as I later discovered, as performed by Julie Atherton. It was a very funny song, extremely wordy but Atherton’s enunciation meant every line and joke was crystal clear and great fun. She also did well at keeping a straight face during a rendition of ‘Popular’ from Wicked as Kate Monster opposite Simon Lipkin’s Trekkie Monster which was just hysterical. And another great moment was a medley of Take That songs performed by the male puppet characters from the show which was laugh-out-loud funny all the way through with its use of backing singers and dance routines. Other good numbers were an uncomplicated passionate version of ‘The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face’ by Luke Evans, a bizarre interpretation of Minnie Riperton’s ‘Loving You’ with bird noises by Gloria Onitri and a group number by the boys of a song from The Full Monty. The medley of songs with love in the title that started the show and was reprised at the end gave a nice feel to the whole evening which was lots of fun."
1698,1698,Ought To Be Clowns,03/05/2011,Ian,Frankenstein, National Theatre,"Perhaps one of the less-successful decisions I have made this year was to revisit Frankenstein at the National Theatre. There was a number of reasons: the opportunity to see Jonny Lee Miller take on the role of the Creature and directly compare and contrast him with Benedict Cumberbatch; it was the final performance of the run; it was actually the third time I had a pair of tickets to see the windy Miller – I’d passed on the other tickets to more receptive friends but given one last chance, I ended up biting the bullet in the spirit of perhaps finding something new in the production. For I did see it much earlier in the run, you can read the review here, and I found it a most problematic play. And my opinion of it still holds firm after a second viewing, I find it simply astounding how forgiving the official reviews were of this show. For sure, the production values are at times sensational and a welcome shot in the arm for National Theatre stagings which will hopefully inspire more creativity in future productions. But the play itself is so terribly weak that to close one’s eyes to its many problems feels like an absolute crime and try as I might, I could not ignore them and try to focus on having a ‘good time’ as my companion attempted to admonish me. In terms of the lead actors, Miller made for a more masculine, animalistic Creature and Cumberbatch a more cerebral Victor. Indeed this was the configuration I thought I wanted to see when the cross-casting was first announced but the casting for the previews was not pre-announced and so we were surprised on the evening with a lucky dip of sorts and I personally thought Cumberbatch was just sensational as the Creature. He made a more interesting set of choices and I was much more fascinated by his journey to enlightenment than I was with Miller’s. And perhaps predictably, Cumberbatch was able to make more of the limited role of Victor so in the final analysis I have to say I think my first experience, with the Cumbercreature and all his Cumberbits on show, was my favourite of the two versions (indeed I find it surprising that so many veered towards the windy Miller being their preference). Around them though, my fears of the supporting cast remained as valid as they were when I first saw the show. Unable to rise above the paucity of the material, matters are exacerbated by some awful acting choices, colour-blind casting that is actively confusing (as I did on first viewing, my friend got terribly mixed up about the relationship between Frankenstein’s father and Mary) and a rushed feeling that means very few are able to create any meaningful presence onstage around the two leads."
1699,1699,Ought To Be Clowns,20/11/2010,Ian,Iolanthe, Union Theatre,"Sasha Regan’s All-Male Iolanthe marks the third Gilbert and Sullivan show to receive the Union Theatre treatment in what is fast becoming an annual tradition of great quality. Last year’s Pirates of Penzance was hugely well-received transferring to both Wilton’s Music Hall and the Rose in Kingston so expectation was high for this lesser-known (by me at least!) show. What is it about? Well, the Lord Chancellor of England is in love with Phyllis, his shepherdess ward who loves Strephon, the half-fairy shepherd whose mother, Iolanthe, was condemned by the Fairy Queen to live at the bottom of a river for marrying a mortal, who is none other than the Lord Chancellor. Thus the House of Lords and the legal profession come in for a bit of a battering as the fairies wreak their mischievous havoc in order to ensure everyone gets their happy ending. With such a convoluted plotline and a considerable number of characters in the ensemble, I can’t imagine there’s much room for manoeuvre in putting an effective, individual interpretation on the show but Sasha Regan really has done a fabulous job here in choosing a framework which neatly sidesteps a whole world of difficulties but provides its own emotional reference points, complemented beautifully by Stewart Charlesworth’s design . When the fairies first arrived, there was a collective intake of breath as we worked out whether it was OK to laugh or not but after just a couple of beats, as it suddenly becomes evident what the framing device is (look at what the costumes are made from…), everyone relaxed into the genial mood. Yes, the constant references to fairies and mentions of a midnight assignation in St James’ Park caused many a titter from the audience but the tone is always an affectionate one, it is silly but not too silly, it is camp but not too camp, above all it is rip-roaring great fun. Matthew James Willis as Earl Tolloller and Kingsley Hall as Earl Mountararat were my favourite performances as the dusty old peers fighting over Phyllis’ hand but finding that their relationship is far more valuable than any woman and though it is amusing, it was unexpectedly sweetly moving too: they really work well together and Willis’ voice in particular is superb. Shaun McCourt also impressed as the Lord Chancellor with the trickiest of songs to sing in When I Went To The Bar. Alan Richardson steps once again into the soprano shoes as Phyllis/Phyliss with another amazing vocal performance of, once again, surprising delicacy given how high into his vocal range he is moving. In fairyland, Kris Manuel’s Geordie Fairy Queen is a comic delight and well supported by Reuben Kaye and Adam Lewis Ford as his gossipy courtiers, all dealing well with the vocal challenges but excelling at keeping things the right side of humourous without descending into farce. And Christopher Finn finds a moving depth to his Iolanthe, the fairy who broke the rules. The only room for improvement that I could see would be in the connection between Phyllis/Phyliss and her intended, Strephon. As the bland romantic lead, Gianni Onori has a bit of a thankless task which is not helped by his rather straight interpretation: there’s not quite enough sense of fun about him yet or sufficient chemistry for us to want Phyllis to end up with him which hopefully will come once more settled into the role. Chris Mundy’s musical direction and piano playing is richly detailed and teases from his company an unvariably high quality performance of Sullivan’s music ranging from the ta-ran-ta-ras of the Peers to the utterly gorgeous body of sound coming from the fairies as they summon Iolanthe from her prison. And the multi-layered powerful Act 1 finale sounds absolutely incredible, probably one of the best musical G&S moments and delivered here with a great urgency and panache. With some neat choreography from Mark Smith, especially with the fairies and their gestures and director Sasha Regan’s innate understanding of how best to utilise the space that she founded, (there’s probably no funnier sight onstage at the moment than the line of Peers approaching you rapidly as they arrive for their first number), this is the perfect early festive treat: book now though, it will surely sell out! Sounds great; must try to get along to see this. And here’s hoping that the second all-male theatre experience of the week proves as enjoyable! 🙂 It is totally worth it, I might even try and shuffle things round to pay a second visit. And stop raising my Propeller expectations even further, hehe 😉 I'm second-visiting on Sunday!"
1700,1700,Ought To Be Clowns,10/10/2018,Ian,Mythic, Charing Cross Theatre,"As we wait for Hadestown to arrive at the National Theatre, an alternative modern musical take on Greek mythology has emerged just across the river at the Charing Cross Theatre. Marcus Stevens and Oran Eldor’s Mythic may have a rather unassuming demeanour by comparison, but it is proves to be something of a gently Olympian success from director/choreographer Sarah O’Gleby. (FYI I caught a late preview of this).  Stevens’ book focuses on the troubled mother/daughter relationship between earth mother goddess Demeter and rebellious teen Persephone. Demeter has rejected the hard-partying celebrity lifestyle of the gods in favour of her Mother Nature ways but Persephone wants nothing more than to drop the trowel and kick it up good with the likes of the Essex-style Aphrodite and an emo Hades.  This she does but as you may know, but Hades is no ordinary bad boy and her independent streak lands her in the underworld with unexpected results. There’s enough of a spin on the tales of old to keep the interest piqued, particularly for a modern audience. But the real appeal comes with the brightly pop/rock-influenced score from Eldor which is chock-full of eminently hummable tunes. Genevieve McCarthy’s Aphrodite is a perky pop princess in the making, full of pointed attitude too; Michael Mather’s Hades is marvellously moody and sounds like a dream (a great debut); and Georgie Westall’s Persephone is a highly likeable central presence. The ensemble are also used in a number of inventive and amusing ways which really integrates them well into the production. "
1701,1701,Ought To Be Clowns,12/02/2014,mag9l,In Skagway, Arcola,"One of the reasons I like going to the Arcola is that the Sainsburys nearby stocks one of my favourite cheeses in the world – Grandma Singleton’s tasty Lancashire if you’re interested – and so I duly made my trip to the Kingsland Shopping Centre before making my way over to the Arcola for In Skagway. So it was quite amusing to hear one of the characters talk about wanting cheese during the play – if only it had been amusing in a good way. For I really didn’t enjoy the play at all. Karen Ardiff’s story of four women stuck in the Alaskan town of Skagway at the tail end of the gold rush failed to grab me from the start, her characterisations simultaneously thinly drawn and utterly predictable, her dialogue so full of cliché as to be laughable. Throw in a lead character who has had a stroke and so communicates via voiceover, numerous flashbacks and dreamlike sequences and there’s something close to an unholy mess."
1702,1702,Ought To Be Clowns,11/05/2013,Ian,The Tempest, Shakespeare’s Globe,"It’s always nice to be surprised by a night at the theatre, especially with a play with which one is rather familiar. And more importantly in the case of The Tempest is the feeling that I have already seen a production of the play that will rank as one of the best pieces of theatre I’ve ever seen in Cheek By Jowl’s extraordinary Russian interpretation back in 2011 – Caliban and Miranda’s parting is forever seared on my mind. But The Globe is nothing if not reliable and in casting Roger Allam as Prospero, director Jeremy Herrin knew exactly how to get me along in hope of a genuinely brave new world. And in some ways it does it. Allam brings a studious humanity to the exiled sorcerer – less anguished magician and more concerned father, making his reading of some of Shakespeare’s most evocative writing almost unbearably moving. His control of the language is just superb, imbuing even the most innocuous of lines with worlds of meaning, so often restrained but flaring magnificently like a bearded Brunnhilde when provoked. He’s wryly amusing too, his insistence on protecting his daughter’s virtue particularly well-observed as a running gag. And for what I think is a first for me, the broad comic strokes so beloved of this venue actually made me laugh with the antics of Trinculo and Stefano. It helped that performers of the calibre of Trevor Fox and Sam Cox (a double act in the making with those surnames surely) have been engaged but with James Garnon’s almost Aboriginal Caliban, their funny business really did the job for me, interacting with the yardlings wonderfully and at one point, acknowledging the planes above in a hilarious interlude. It’s not all perfect though as whilst the production doesn’t drag per se, it does dawdle occasionally – lacking a sense of pace at several moments making it feel every minute of its running time. The scenes with the Neapolitan courtiers are really quite flat; the masque, as attractive as it is, comes close to outstaying its welcome; even the final scenes as they wind to their conclusion have a stateliness about them. And I don’t know if it was just me but every time the sound effects kicked in for the various magical spells, I found them overwhelming the speech onstage. And for all the quality of the acting, there isn’t always a depth to the relationships between the key characters. There’s little sense of how Prospero exerts such feared control over Caliban, Colin Morgan’s Ariel is admirably agile but underplays the searching questions that precede the granting of his independence. And I just wasn’t a fan of Jessie Buckley’s Miranda, coming across as less naïve than plain simple-minded though the youthful exuberance that comes from her coupling with Joshua James’ Ferdinand, a truly excellent comic reading of what can be a dull part, is most sweet indeed."
1703,1703,Ought To Be Clowns,05/03/2014,mag9l,We Are Proud To Present…, Bush Theatre,"Some plays leave you thinking, and though it is now a couple of days since I saw the Bush Theatre’s We Are Proud To Present…, I’m still utterly unsure about it. This is the European premiere of Jackie Sibblies Drury’s US hit from 2012 whose full title is in fact We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, From the GermanSudwestafrika, Between the Years 1884 – 1915 and Sibblies Drury has adapted the text for a British cast, and presumably a British audience. For the play blisters through the weight of our colonial past, the state of current race relations and the ability of theatre to effectively process them, asking if art can find a healing way through such tangled and tortured history to find a potentially brighter future. So it is hard not to feel a little despondent at the way Gbolahan Obisesan’s production plays out, the playwright’s indictment of white people in general so unsettling and thought-provoking, the starkly uncompromising attitude breathtakingly bold. There’s a deal of invention in the set-up too. A group of six actors – four men, two women; three black, three white – gather to give us first an overview, then a lecture and then a presentation about the matter in hand, which is the brutality with which German colonial rulers exploited local tribes in the soi-disant first genocide of the twentieth century in what is now known as Namibia. And as the only primary source of evidence is letters sent home by German soldiers which speak not of their actions, thus the actors opt to improvise their way through what might have happened. Which leads to an interesting exploration of the way in which history is constructed (through the eyes of the ‘victor’), and the way we tell stories (refracted through our own experiences). Here, race becomes a hugely pertinent issue as the actors question whether they can ever get into the mindset of the Herero tribespeople who are at the centre of their work. Can a British black person ever understand what it is like for an African? Can they ever really, truly imagine what life was like a century ago? And where do white people fit into this equation? Initially, a sense of humour prevails about the whole enterprise. Initially the focus is on the internal power struggles in the company, exposing much of the vanity inherent in the creative process. And Sibblies Drury repeatedly flicks between the play-within-a-play and the rehearsal room, showing how the actors serve the material or rather, make it serve as a showcase for themselves. From the ridiculous (impression of an ageing cat) to the sublime (a showboating of the number of accents they can do punches home with immense power about the horrendously repetitive nature of genocides), it’s an effective technique."
1704,1704,Ought To Be Clowns,09/07/2013,Ian,The Big Idea – PIIGS Spain, Royal Court via YouTube,"The Spanish take on The Big Idea featured the short plays Chalk Land by Vanessa Montfort and Merit by Alexandra Wood, interspersed with some verbatim accounts of interviews that Montfort conducted with some Spanish people. Though the last to be performed, this was actually the first of the set that I watched but I genuinely did find it hugely engaging from start to finish. Director Richard Twyman ensured that Chalk Land had the visual humour, though of a distinctly bittersweet note, to accompany the conversation between a homeless man and a passer-by full of indignance at the injustice of the world, Robert Lonsdale and Mariah Gale pairing up well. And Wood’s Merit was a fascinating look at the ethical compromises people are willing to make in terms of getting and securing a job, but also at the ethics of friends and family around us from whom we might well benefit. Meera Syal and Paul Chahidi as the parents pussyfooting around their concern for their daughter, Gale again full of righteous fire, both giving excellent performances. I really enjoyed the verbatim accounts though, raising the powerful issue of how media coverage of austerity shies away from the ordinariness of so many of the victims and preferring to focus on stock images of poverty-ridden people in order to separate ‘them’ from ‘us’ even as the dividing line has become so blurred as to not even exist any more. And because I was enjoying the theatre so much, the filming of it didn’t bother me half as much as it did when watching Masterpieces, so perhaps it is less of a deal than I originally thought. Especially considering that this format is hugely widening access to these punchy new plays, it does feel a little churlish to criticise the quality too strongly. But in any case, if you’re only going to watch one of these PIIGS films, I’d go for Spain.   "
1705,1705,Ought To Be Clowns,15/09/2009,Ian,Breakfast At Tiffany’s, Theatre Royal Haymarket,"Events did not start off well by the first main scene seriously evoking the recent corpse of Too Close To The Sun with some pointlessly fast revolving sets, followed by a metal lampshade that lost control and clanged endlessly against a bit of the set, and then by a cringeworthy dance routine which left most of my party helpless with the giggles. This triple threat should have warned us to leave then and there: the evening did not get any better. I really wanted to like Anna Friel in this, I really did, but by golly she made it hard for me. So much about her performance just didn’t work for me, I was really quite surprised. Her accent wavered a lot, and was rather under-powered, so that it was often difficult to hear her: either she needs to gain more confidence and project better, or the microphones need to be turned up. But this would still not address the main problem for me which was that she just didn’t exude any charisma at all as Holly Golightly. I didn’t believe for one minute that she could have these men wrapped around her finger, nor see the appeal for Fred. Her singing voice was pleasant enough, but none of the songs really packed any emotional impact. Joseph Cross as the amorous Fred brought an appealing fresh-faced innocence to his part, and wasn’t too afraid of whipping his parts out either for that matter, but the lack of chemistry between the two meant that my interest just wasn’t there. And James Dreyfus felt horribly cast against type as Holly’s agent. The set looks for the most part cheap and nasty: the predominant colour is an awful shade of mint green and the skyline looks like something I once made in primary school. The split level bit is effective but the sky painted onto the front of it didn’t do it for me at all. And there is an amazing scene with a random little sailboat that trundles on along the back which led to at least three audible guffaws from around us, it just looks ridiculous. The highlight for me was when the (admittedly cute) cat lingered onstage after being released from its carrycase, instead of making a swift exit, which elicited the only real emotion of the evening. Not even the nudity (both male and female) could save it, indeed two of us missed the scene where Fred stood up in the bath since we were both dozing, there was a little confusion among the others over what you actually saw at this point so feel free to let me know if we missed anything good! Or rather, save your pennies and don’t bother with this one. Oh, it's got James Dreyfus in it.  Recipe for disaster."
1706,1706,Ought To Be Clowns,24/04/2010,Ian,Holding the Man, Trafalgar Studios,"Importing the two main leads and the director from the highly successful Australian production, Holding the Man makes its UK debut at the Trafalgar Studios. Written by Tommy Murphy but based on Tim Conigrave’s 1995 memoir of the same name, it is a love story charting the high and lows of the relationship between Tim and John Caleo, the captain of the football team at their high school no less, over 15 years. It has garnered much acclaim in its native country, but added to that with this transfer is the UK stage debut of comic genius Jane Turner, Kath out of Kath and Kim, as you will not have failed to notice if you’ve seen any of the advance publicity for this show! I went to see this play without knowing anything about it or the circumstances in which it was written and so therefore, its impact on me was phenomenal. If you don’t know anything about it either, then I have to say I would recommend coming back here at a later date to read this review, but rest assured that this is probably the first stone-cold must-see play of the year. It is extremely, painfully funny but also heartbreakingly true-to-life as both Conigrave and Caleo died of AIDS and the book on which this was based was published just months after Conigrave’s death. But rather than locating this story in the broader political context of how HIV/AIDS affected the gay community, in the way say Angels in America did, the focus of Holding the Man is intensely personal: this is Tim and John’s story and all the more emotionally powerful for it. It starts in Melbourne in the 1970s with how Tim and John got together whilst still at a Jesuit high school and then follows them through the trials and tribulations of being a young gay couple, the different reactions of their families as they came out, the struggles to deal with long distance relationships as they go to different universities and discover a new world of meeting other gay men. Act two then takes a much darker turn as both men are diagnosed as HIV positive and then develop full-blown AIDS. As with the recent import of the cast of Hair, we get all the benefit of players already intimately familiar with the material and each other, and in Guy Edmonds as Tim and Matt Zeremes as John, we have two extremely good performances, completely convincing in taking us through the charming naïveté of schoolboys in love to young adults with differing agendas. Their relationship is beautifully portrayed, never backing away from showing the difficulties they often faced, whether from those around them (the piercing comment from one father saying it was easier to say that John was dying of cancer rather than AIDS and his almost disappointment once said cancer was cured punched the air out of the whole room) or the decisions they make for themselves with tragic consequences (without giving too much away, the show is Tim’s attempt at redemption), but in their tender moments, it would take a heart of stone not to be taken in by their story. Around them swirls a multitude of supporting characters, played by four actors with dizzying speed and to largely hilarious effect. It is here that Jane Turner is found, and it may seem a curiously understated choice for her UK stage debut but it plays to her comic strengths and in the first half in particular is frequently found stealing the show: you will never want to see her in a sleeping bag again though. However, she is matched by Simon Burke, awarded my Most Versatile Actor fosterIAN award last year (and indeed Best Actor in a Musical), reinforcing said versatility in a vast range of crucial cameos ranging from leather daddy in a gay bar hunting for fresh meat to embittered father at a deathbed redrafting his son’s will to his own benefit. Anna Skellern and Oliver Farnworth also provide nice moments with Juliet, Tim’s fag-hag-in-training and Peter, a gay nurse friend, two of the minor characters given a little more stage time than most. Their combined performances were all the more impressive given this was the first preview and not a slip or mistake was apparent. Design-wise, it is set on a mostly bare stage with an array of props and actors’ mirrors that are inventively used to evoke a wide range of locations and there’s some great use of costumes and wigs as we skip through the 70s and 80s. The key though is in the lighting which is just exquisite, I’m not sure if it is was imported from the original production, whereas Brian Thomson the designer came from that production, lighting designer James Whiteside is new to the team. Either way, it was brilliantly done. I have to admit to not really being a fan of puppets and my heart did sink as the first scene opened with a toy astronaut representing Armstrong’s first steps on the moon. Fortunately, further use was limited even if I remained sceptical of how effective it was, but it finally comes into its own in the final scenes when the puppetry was finally deployed to most hauntingly harrowing effect. Heartwrenching and persuasive, Holding the Man is a truly rollercoaster ride of emotion as we got through self-discovery, love and ultimately tragedy, but it plays as a beautiful tribute to these two men and a beautiful affirmation of the enduring power of love between people, no matter what their sexuality. Go and see it now. do wish people who revew plays would get the names of those involved correct – my name is Brian THOMSON – the set designer Brian's, ahem, been around a while. He designed the original Rocky Horror Show. Yes, the one upstairs at the Royal Court. Corrected now, sorry my mistake. I hurriedly scribbled down the creative names from my friend's programme, had they been a tad cheaper I might have bought one for myself 😉 Well I did offer it. 🙂 Whoop, way to take a compliment on your work and fauning review Brian THOMSON.  Now we've all spelt it correctly maybe we can sleep at night. Do wish people leaving self-important comments on theatre reviews would at least have the decency to spell 'review' correctly. and 'fawning'  🙂 I will do my best not to make any spelling mistakes!The play is very good, difficult to fit it all into the time I guess.One of the things which really shines from the book is the support which Tim and John receive from all their friends. Not a criticism – very difficult to portray on stage in the time allowed.The play is good – the book is breathtaking."
1707,1707,Ought To Be Clowns,22/11/2013,Ian,Home, Arcola,"An unexpected delight, David Storey’s much-celebrated but rarely performed Home proved to be something rather lovely in its strange way, almost anti-dramatic in its structure and conventions, but beautifully moving in its deliberate poetry and pitch-perfect performances. Amelia Sears’ production for SEArED reconfigures the smaller Arcola studio into the round and Naomi Dawson’s design is just beautiful, hinting at where we might be but carrying much of the ambiguity that is contained within the play itself. We start with a gorgeous sequence between old hands Jack and Harry, bantering and chatting about the old days in a most fragmented way, lamenting the Britain of the past and delivering their old patter routines to while away the hours as if two old friends had just met up. But their reverie is shattered by the arrival of Kathleen and Marjorie as we soon realise that we’re actually in the grounds of a mental asylum, something confirmed by the final addition, the genuinely disturbed, and much younger, Alfred. Thus the seeming pointlessness of the earlier chatter gains an almost unbearable poignancy and we come to understand that none of them have the chance of release, and that the things that they mourn are not just lost to them because of the past, but also in the present too. Britain has left them behind as we have abandoned so many of our old folk, and if Storey’s point about the decline of the nation feels a little stretched, it is hard to ignore in the quiet intensity of this production."
1708,1708,Ought To Be Clowns,06/09/2016,mag9l,Bumblescratch, Adelphi,"In the cut-throat world of the West End, introducing a new musical is an undoubted challenge so it is quite gratifying to see the backers of Bumblescratch going all out to make its mark with this gala concert launch. With merchandise available, a full-throttle social media campaign in train, and a top-notch cast and creative team making the most of their two week rehearsal period, there’s certainly no lack of ambition here. Set in London during the Great Plague of 1665 and Great Fire of 1666, the show is told from the perspective of plague rat Melbourne Bumblescratch and the anthropomorphic nature of the musical should come as no surprise once you learn it was written by Robert J Sherman, who has both form of his own (Love Birds) and an impressive family history (A Spoonful of Sherman) to live up to when it comes to writing a tune or two. And Bumblescratch certainly has a song or two, racking up 37 in its through-sung couple of hours. It’s fascinating to see Sherman stretch his creative side this way – early songs like the jaunty ‘At Least A Rat ‘as Got An Excuse’ and child’s-audition-stalwart-in-the-making ‘Adorable Me!’ continue the quirky, light-hearted style that characterises much of Love Birds, but there’s also a distinct move into a more mature vein of musical theatre, as the plot darkens and becomes more emotionally dramatic. This shift isn’t quite as successful yet, Sherman’s stretching of his own musical identity pushes the score into solid but occasionally unremarkable balladry, leaving too much of it sounding the same. There’s also a bit of a split in the book – Melbourne’s lascivious ways are put in check by his adoption of a young’un called Perry but the way in which the story unfolds, with its human love interests, ghost pirate kings and gory deaths, is inconsistent (is this a show for families or not?) and at times, unclear. The unrelenting focus on Melbourne also has the impact of inhibiting effective characterisations for the supporting cast."
1709,1709,Ought To Be Clowns,02/10/2015,mag9l,La Musica, Young Vic,"It came as little surprise, after leaving La Musica at the Young Vic, to discover Jeff James has worked with Ivo van Hove as Assistant Director on A View From The Bridge and Antigone. van Hove’s influence is thrillingly palpable on this two-hander as it has clearly encouraged James to explore the representation of space and how it can be broken free from a traditionally naturalistic (perhaps British) style to something more expressionistic, European even. That he achieves in two strikingly different ways in this adaptation of Marguerite Duras’ play, translated by Barbara Bray, which is itself split into two. For the first part, the actors (Sam Troughton and Emily Barclay) are sat high to the right on a platform in the corner of the Maria studio in front of two cameras, their backs to the audience, two large screens dominating the space we look at. And in intense, extreme close-up, this divorcing couple lay bare the tatters of their relationship. Ostensibly meeting up in a hotel lobby, the unflinching gaze of the camera leaves no room to hide as they quickly move past the pretext of what to do with some shared furniture to the emotional turbulence of their marriage, the damage it has inflicted upon both of them, the impact it still has on their current, new, engagements. Planted so firmly in the role of voyeur, this almost confrontational closeness is breath-taking, the gnomic quality of the text further heightening the artistic hauteur. But from that icy aloofness then comes a real intimacy – a brief pause sees the audience re-sited and reconfigured into a square with Troughton and Barclay moving right in there among us. That private space which was carved out so elegantly on giant screens becomes claustrophobically, inescapably real as Troughton’s Michel cries on your shoulder, Barclay’s Anne-Marie pushes exasperatedly past you, as the toxicity of their doomed love becomes all too viscerally real. "
1710,1710,Ought To Be Clowns,02/08/2017,Ian,The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 ¾, Menier Chocolate Factory,"After premiering at the Curve Theatre in 2015, Pippa Cleary and Jake Brunger’s musical adaptation of Sue Townsend’s tale of Leicester’s most famous teenager has undergone its own version of puberty, re-emerging at the Menier Chocolate Factory for the summer. And those growing pains seem to have been worth it as The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 ¾ has matured beautifully, a powerful example of how musicals need to be allowed to develop, resulting in this case in a fantastic new British musical. Luke Sheppard’s production certainly benefits from the intimacy of the South London venue but where it now excels is in its emotional intensity. The scenes between Adrian (played by Ilan Galkoff at this performance) and his mother Pauline, an achingly superb Kelly Price, are just heart-breaking, as he struggles to realise just how far her women’s lib-inspired independence will take her from him. I was reminded that reading this book was in fact was one of the main ways I learned about divorce and that scarce comprehension is captured perfectly here."
1711,1711,Ought To Be Clowns,23/12/2010,Ian,The Winter’s Tale, RSC at the Roundhouse,"Sometimes quite a difficult play to pull off due to the disparate nature of its two main strands, The Winter’s Tale remains a popular choice for the RSC and this production, part of the Roundhouse season, was originally seen in Stratford in 2009. Starting off in the highly ordered Sicilia, Leontes rules with a tight discipline, ill-equipped to deal with the warm emotion of his wife Hermione. Playing the genial hostess to their friend Polixenes, King of Bohemia, rouses a terrible jealousy in Leontes though and charging them with adultery, he sets in train a terrible set of events that hugely alter his life. Much of the second half takes place 16 years later in Bohemia with events much advanced, but we eventually return to Sicilia to revisit Leontes and his court for the final denouement. David Farr’s production is superbly mounted and works as a timely reminder that even the greatest of men can be undone by a moment of frailty and the echoing impact of the emotions and decisions of those in power throughout the rest of society. It is one of Shakespeare’s most impressionistic plays, there’s perhaps more suspension of disbelief necessary than usual in here, but it works as a tale of human nature and the rewards for those who are faithful and loyal throughout and this production manages to balance the two sides well, provoking huge emotional depths especially in a beautiful rendition of the ending but also raising spirits and laughs aplenty. Due to the indisposition of three key actors, there was a fair bit of shuffling round in the ensemble which made the jaw drop even further in admiration for this ensemble. Not only are they covering numerous roles across numerous productions at the same time, they’re understudying roles in those plays as well, it is quite some feat. And so we had Sam Troughton on for Darrell D’Silva as Polixenes, Adam Burton on for Tunji Kasim as Florizel, David Rubin on as Antigonus for James Gale and covering one of Troughton’s smaller roles and Gruffydd Glyn covering Dion, also for Troughton. Troughton was particularly superb, managing a gruffness of tone which belied his young age and convinced as the garrulous father to Burton’s well-played loved-up Florizel, coping extremely well with the physical aspects of the role, including getting Perdita up a tree with his legs. What was delightful to see though was the company taking its time to give each man their own round of applause at the end, recognising their strong efforts and proving beyond any doubts that the bonds in this company go way beyond the professional. Elsewhere in the ensemble there were strong performances from John Mackay as Camillo, Kelly Hunter’s statuesque impassioned Hermione and Greg Hicks’ Leontes, shell-shocked by what happens to his family. ‘Tis usually the case that the Sicilia scenes get the better acting because it is more serious but there was good comic work from Gruffydd Glyn as the Young Shepherd and Samantha Young found nice depth to her Perdita. But the star turn for me is Noma Dumezweni’s Paulina, a powerful voice of reason throughout and the stage manager of the shocking finale which she delivers with a beautiful tenderness. Jon Bausor’s design translated extremely well to the Roundhouse with the ordered austerity of Sicilia being shattered by a grand coup de théâtre as large bookshelves tumble to the floor, books scatter everywhere and pages blown right through the stage by a gust of wind. The famous bear then rises from this paper to consume Antigonus and Bohemia comes to be represented as a bucolic pastoral fantasy with paper strewn everywhere and trees with pages for leaves. A dark shift in lighting from Jon Clark returns us to the desolate Sicilia for the final Act and with Moorish lanterns slowly warming the place up as we move to the touching conclusions, life begins to return to this land. It looks amazing and one would never guess that this was not the original theatre for this production, quite an impressive feat."
1712,1712,Ought To Be Clowns,05/10/2010,Ian,A Number, Menier Chocolate Factory,"This production of Caryl Churchill’s A Number at the Menier Chocolate Factory is a revival of the 2006 production in Sheffield which starred real-life father and son, Timothy West and Samuel West who reappear here with the same director in Jonathan Munby. In order to retain the integrity of the show, the Menier has been reconfigured into the round for the first time ever, something which works so well here, I hope they think about doing it again. Coming in at 50 minutes without a break, it rips through its central debate of nature versus nurture with a side order of the ethics of cloning as it poses questions about the nature of identity. Salter is a man who, for initially unknown reasons, had his four year old son Bernard cloned. Years later, Bernard discovers that he has a cloned brother and confronts his father, but in doing so discovers that there’s ‘a number’ of the clones and thus the debate begins. Timothy West is good as the man clinging on to the self-justification of his questionable decision, full of nervous tics but it is Samuel West who is excellent as the three sons, making the distinctions between them all crystal clear and demonstrating exactly where Churchill lies on the issue of whether people with the same genetic identity can have separate identities."
1713,1713,Ought To Be Clowns,26/11/2010,Ian,The Cradle Will Rock, Arcola,"The final show to take place in the main theatre at the Arcola’s current premises on Arcola Street in Dalston, The Cradle Will Rock also marks the 10th anniversary of the theatre founded by Artistic Director Mehmet Ergen which will be moving just down the road to the Colourworks building and opening there with a new Rebecca Lenkiewicz play about Joseph Turner in the New Year. With book, music and lyrics by American Mark Blitzstein, the musical is set in a fictional town, Steeltown, USA and concerns the wide rifts between workers and the wealthy at a time when millions were unemployed: in this case it is the union struggles of the interwar period and 1937, though there’s much resonance in the material of the nefarious influence of those in positions of power on the average citizen that echo through to today. Events take place as a liberty committee made up of the great and good of this particular town are arrested by a confused rookie cop on the very evening that the workers in the steel plant are voting whether to unionise themselves, that committee having set out to stop the vote. But as a series of vignettes play out, we come to see how each of the town’s leaders have fallen under the corrupt influence of the steel magnate Mr Mister with only a previous few people able to withstand the pressure and fight for what they believe is right and fair. I have to be honest with you dear readers and say that very little of this was clear to either of us last night whilst watching the show. The device of mini-stories allowed for the large cast of around 16, several of whom cover more than one role, to each have their moment and it is all done very well but it did feel like there was no access point to get into the show without prior knowledge. This was the second and final preview but I don’t think that really had an impact as the performances were most accomplished, it is just a rather obtusely told story. Lyrically it is sharp and musically it is very much of its time, with a strong 1930s Brechtian feel, but crucially the book just didn’t help to make anything clear. I’m not normally one to recommend reading synopses before seeing shows but it would have helped the two of us immensely in this particular case. That is not to say that we didn’t enjoy it, him more than me, but it was hard to build emotional connections with so many characters who appeared for such a short space of time and with little explanation. As an ensemble piece, the quality was pleasingly strong across the board with an incredible amount of vocal talent but certain people did shine for me: Josie Benson has probably the song of the show as the emotional woman trying to stop the death of a loved one being covered up with a hugely impressive vocal, Alicia Davies’ sweet-voiced poor but kindly prostitute also had a good couple of songs, Chris Jenkins’ passionate foreman did excellently with the title song and Russell Dauber and Stuart Matthew Price had great fun as the two creative types who’ve sold out their artistic integrity for a life of comfort with a highly amusing camply-observed and vocally interesting song taking us into the interval."
1714,1714,Ought To Be Clowns,17/03/2010,Ian,Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story, Upstairs at the Gatehouse,"  Previously a long-running staple of the West End, Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story returns to North London for its first fringe production in Highgate’s Upstairs at the Gatehouse. It tracks the meteoric rise of Buddy Holly who managed to become one of the world’s top recording artists and shape the future of rock’n’roll music in just a couple of years before his untimely early death. This musical puts that music full square in the centre of the show and deservedly so. Part biopic, part tribute concert, we follow Buddy and his Crickets friends on their struggles to record the type of music they wanted, their subsequent rise to fame and what it did to them. Featuring about 20 of Holly’s songs (almost every one a classic) and both acts climax in mini concerts, indeed most of the second act is a replication of the ill-fated final concert at Clear Lake, featuring Richie Valens with La Bamba and Big Poppa singing Chantilly Lace on top of Buddy Holly’s numbers to provide a bit of variety and it is all just an absolute pleasure to watch. As Buddy Holly, Roger Rowley is very accomplished and he needs to be, the whole show rests on his shoulders, but he gets across the perfectionist intensity that drove him to great things in the studio and the nerdy charisma that permitted him to convince others to stay with him recording things over and over. His singing and guitar playing were also of an excellent standard, keeping the audience engaged and enthralled throughout. All the actor/musician ensemble members work extremely hard though, all playing multiple roles and switching between instruments with ease. Stand-outs for me were Jason Blackwater’s Big Bopper, Nicky Swift’s sax playing, Jos Slovick’s Ritchie Valens and probably the funniest moment of the night, Deanna Farnell’s comic rendition of the US national anthem. But there really are no weak links here, everyone is having a great time and it shows. There are issues around the scene changes. Having to wrestle large instruments and cables around a very small space presents the obvious logistical problems and these will become smoother over time, but there were much simpler changes which took just as long for no apparent reason and these really do need to be tightened up. And if you are going for a night of drama, then you will be disappointed: the telling of the story really does take a backseat to the music with very little emotional engagement being permitted, the only real connection coming with Buddy and new wife Maria-Elena duetting on ‘True Love Ways’ and no real drama, even during the split with his backing band, the Crickets. And this is the only real problem with Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story: because his life was so tragically short, there isn’t too much of a story to tell and little insight is provided here. In being so strong during the musical scenes, one longs for the dialogue to stop and for the band to start playing again. That said, for an evening’s entertainment, especially if you’re a fan of this era’s music, then you can’t go far wrong than visiting this tiny space for a larger-than-life experience."
1715,1715,Ought To Be Clowns,18/12/2019,Ian,Teenage Dick, Donmar Warehouse,"There’s something a little interesting about the way that theatre, and theatre criticism, is tackling disability. Movements towards promoting racial diversity have rightfully been widely celebrated and are beginning the process of hopefully recalibrating the theatrical and critical firmament for good. But when it comes to disability, the same can’t be really said… Onstage, glimmers like the current RSC ensemble and the recently closed Joe Egg remain the exception rather than the rule; when it comes to reviewers, disabled voices are even thinner on the ground (are we surprised, when accessibility in so much pub theatres remains limited, when captioning services are rarely available by press night…).   Which is all a rather long-winded way of introducing the canny brilliance of Mike Lew’s Teenage Dick, open now at the Donmar Warehouse, and to pull up Michael Billington on assumptions made in his response. His final paragraph talks of “a radical shift in the politics of disability and a revolution in theatrical performance” which he feels undermines the play’s argument about how disabled people can be treated in a society that always, always bends to the ableist. There’s just so much privilege baked in there that I feel I have to react, even if Billington is on his valedictory lap of honour.   When was the last time you saw two disabled actors in a company of six in a ‘regular’ production? The only reason you see two here at the Donmar is because it is specified that the two roles of Richard and Barbara “Buck” Buckingham should be played by disabled actors. There’s a real thrill in getting to see Daniel Monks and Ruth Madeley interact for reasons outwith their (different) disabilities, but I think we’re kidding ourselves if we’re yet in a place where this would happen organically. So too in society, things may have changed some when it comes the “politics” but the reality is a world full of people who are far too happy to retweet inspiration porn of babies hearing for the first time but who will moan loudly if they end up at a subtitled performance, never mind the daily grind of having to deal with people ‘dealing’ with one’s disability. "
1716,1716,Ought To Be Clowns,25/02/2019,Ian,How To Date a Magical Creature, VAULT Festival,"The beauty of improv is, of course, that you can make up anything you like and so it follows that you can base an improv show around anything. Which is, I think, how we’ve ended up with How To Date a Magical Creature, a Parky-style chat show with a guest list made up of an array of fantastical beasts suggested by the audience .  And from their imagination at this show, were plucked such luminaries as the Loch Ness Monster with wings, an ethnically ambiguous unicorn, and the Mongolian deathworm, not to mention Turnip the teenage witch and Hades. An eclectic and impressive mixture, all put through their paces by effortlessly charismatic host Toby Vanilla (Jonah Fazel), a man who knows just what his voice can do… There’s a clever mix of ideas to keep everyone on their toes, these are no simple interviews. So Nessie is encouraged to sing a song from their forthcoming free jazz album, Turnip recites poetry and best of all, scenes from the past which have been caught on CCTV are brought to life. The wisecracking Vanilla clearly relishes the ways he can manipulate his pals and in turn, at this performance at least, his pals relish being able to turn the tables on Fazel. "
1717,1717,Ought To Be Clowns,27/01/2019,Ian,Blue Departed, VAULT Festival,"There’s a memorably dizzying poetry to Serafina Cusack’s writing, which makes her play Blue Departed an absolute treat to listen to and one that I wanted to be able to read straightaway to recapture its strange beauty and pitch-black humour. Interestingly, the publicity cites Dante’s Inferno as a key influence though it proves to be an inspiration that is worn lightly and likely for the best. Cusack’s focus is on Him. And Her. A couple deeply in love, with each other and with smack, so much so that when he comes home to find her OD’d on the floor, his instinct is to spend as much time with her as he can, rather than report her death. Thus Blue Departed plays out as a fantasia in which Him desperately tries to keep Her alive, replaying key moments in their relationship and talking to her, even whilst trying to get through her funeral and wake.  Cusack’s lurid poetry is particularly well-suited to the evocation of drug-fuelled highs and crushing comedown lows and as a contrasting vision in mint green and aquamarine sequins, Mark Conway and Rebecca Layoo give a powerful portrayal of how addiction can take root anywhere and turn into a trap from which it is nigh-on impossible to escape. Both revel in the linguistic contortions of the script and are suitably frantic in their energy."
1718,1718,Ought To Be Clowns,28/03/2018,Ian,Under The Skin / Is This Thing On?, Old Red Lion,"As Women’s History Month draws to a close, the folks at the Old Red Lion are putting on a double-bill featuring up-and-coming female theatre-makers – Tik-sho-ret Theatre Company’s Under The Skin and Frigg Theatre’s Is This Thing On?. As they’re both relatively short, it’d be rude not to take ’em both in. In the wrong hands, a story such as Under The Skin could be incendiary – a love story between a Nazi officer and a Jewish prisoner, and a lesbian romance at that. But Yonatan Calderon’s play has its basis in extraordinary truth and directed here by Ariella Eshed, it has a lot to say to about the complexity of human nature and how identity can be too easily pigeon-holed. Shifting between near-present and past, between the first Gulf War and the Second World War, between an encounter between a journalist and a Holocaust survivor and the strange progress of that love affair in a concentration camp, Calderon makes a powerful case for really interrogating what we mean by morality, how we look at the past and how we let it shape us now. Bold fringe work.  Is This Thing On? comes to us as a debut production from Nordic company Frigg Theatre and feels a lyrical, delicate thing. Dísa Andersen’s play probes into the subject of abuse in relationships as 17-year-old Joanna gets swept up into the heady excitement of life with new 26-year-old boyfriend Jack with his iguana tattoo and just a little bit of a temper. Andersen’s prose has something of a poetic bent to it, with its repetitions and confessional structure. And the way in which she explores the thin line between sex and violence (aided here by movement by Julie Vaapenstand Holm) is disturbing and intriguing in the way abusive behaviour can be normalised, rationalised, forgiven even, by its victims, whilst also showing us that the strength to break the cycle is always there too."
1719,1719,Ought To Be Clowns,26/02/2020,Ian,The Prince of Egypt, Dominion Theatre,"Way way back, many centuries ago, but a little bit more after the Bible began, someone decided that Old Testament justice really was the way forward for musical theatre. And so here we have a musical that features two ethnic massacres of children but it’s all OK if you sing a ballad afterwards to atone (even if you’ve sanctioned the murder of your de facto nephew) and others will then tell you it’s ok “when you believe”. The Prince of Egypt picks up a few generations after Joseph and co set up shop in the land of the Nile, where the Hebrew population is now spiralling out of control for the Egyptian authorities. Enlightened thinking about immigrants hasn’t quite reached these shores, so the Hebrews find themselves enslaved and upon the order of the slaughter of all their newborn boys by a grumpy Pharoah Seti, an intrepid Yocheved pops her baby into a basket and hopes that he’ll get picked up by a queen rather than a crocodile.    Conveniently, it is Tuya, the Queen of Egypt who finds him and adopts him and thus Moses becomes the adoptive brother of Ramses and life is great for the two princes in their nifty outfits (I swear the fashion inspiration for their first look is the ‘I Know Him So Well’ video) until Moses discovers the truth about his heritage, killing a man along the way (it’s OK because he’s a mean guard) and decides that he needs to follow his destiny to liberate his people, no matter what, no matter how many children get killed along the way. Taking the Bible literally is often dicey ground (shellfish, polyester, your wife defending your life in a fight by grabbing your attacker’s genitals…), and Philip LaZebnik’s book exacerbates this by pairing this narrative with some painfully earnest dialogue that does little to evoke any of the inspirational lessons that so many take from the Scripture. So too does Stephen Schwartz’s score rely too much on the empty bombast of pop rather than alchemising with the narrative to create memorable musical theatre. Matters aren’t helped by an inconsistent production from director Scott Schwartz (son of…) that always prioritises scale over subtlety, apart from one moment of true grace in the loss of those firstborns. Kevin Depinet’s set design relies heavily Jon Driscoll’s projections which are far more effective in their abstract imagery than when they go for realism. And much use is made of Sean Cheeseman’s highly kinetic choreography is which ultimately feels very hit and miss. The embodiment of the burning bush is effectively done (as are the temple walls) but when the company are rolling on the floor as wafting bulrushes or pesky sand devils, it is highly distracting.  But despite all this, a highly committed cast do their best to ride out these production choices to deliver work that fills the Dominion well. Luke Brady and Liam Tamne are both highly appealing as the brothers whose emotional connection isn’t ever quite sundered by diverging destinies, and Christine Allado finds more depth than you might initially expect for Tzipporah, Moses’ eventual wife. The production can also rely on some big names in small parts – Gary Wilmot has literally one song as Jethro, Alexia Khadime’s Miriam is sorely underused, actual queen Debbie Kurup as Queen Tuya. "
1720,1720,Ought To Be Clowns,24/11/2011,Ian,The Playboy of the Western World, Old Vic,"Daring indeed for Robert Sheehan, known to some, if not me, for his part in Misfits, chose to make his professional stage debut at the Old Vic in this revival of The Playboy of the Western World. A 1907 play by Irish writer JM Synge which caused riots with its opening performance which seems rather hard to fathom now, but its Set on the West Coast of Ireland in the early 1900s, Christy Mahon is a mysterious stranger who arrives in a County Mayo pub and declares that he has killed his father. But the locals love the drama and the story-telling wit that he brings into their life and rather than condemning him, elevate him with hero-worship and he attracts the romantic attentions of many of a woman, including engaged barmaid Pegeen. I have to say I was thoroughly underwhelmed by Sheehan’s Christy, lacking the real verve and charisma needed to convince as the absolute charmer he’s meant to be, a really odd piece of casting in that I just couldn’t see what it was that he was meant to be bringing to the show, it certainly wasn’t the gift of the gab. Ruth Negga fared better as Pegeen but also didn’t really possess the kind of mastery of the text that would have pulled me into this world a bit more. But then I don’t think it would have won me over in any case as this is a very broad, Oirish world in John Crowley’s production, with many performances from supporting characters on a knife edge of just too much."
1721,1721,Ought To Be Clowns,24/11/2010,Ian,Charged, Soho Theatre,"Charged is a theatrical experience by the Clean Break company at the Soho Theatre which brings six female playwrights together to create six half-hour dramas about women in the criminal justice system and the myriad ways in which they can be affected. Clean Break have been working in the arenas of theatre and education for over thirty years with women affected in all sorts of ways to try and achieve both personal and political change and is the only UK theatre company working with these women. A company of eleven actresses and three directors are spread over three performance areas in the Soho Theatre building, the main auditorium, the restaurant downstairs and the attic-like studio on the top floor. The six plays have been split into two separate sequences of three plays, Charged 1 and Charged 2 which can be seen independently of each other or together, but even then, the audience is divided into two upon arrival and so experience different journeys through the material. Mini-reviews of each of the plays can be read by clicking on the links in their titles, what follows is more of an overview of the whole experience. Charged 1 features Dream Pill by Rebecca Prichard, Fatal Light by Chloë Moss and Taken by Winsome Pinnock covering issues like child sex trafficking, mothers separated from their children whilst in prison, insufficient mental health diagnoses and the effects of drug addiction on families. Consequently, it is probably the harder viewing of the two, with an intensity of uncomfortable emotion starting off in the harrowing Dream Pill which still haunts me now, moving to the painful enforced separation of mother and child in Fatal Light and the shattered family connections of Taken. Charged 2, the second sequence was unfortunately marked by the worst experience I had and also the best play of the entire two sets, quite the contrast. Dancing Bears by Sam Holcroft, That Almost Unnameable Lust by Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Doris Day by EV Crowe are the plays covering gang violence, older women’s experience in prison and the struggle of modern women to cope in the macho world of the police force respectively. Despite massive issues with the staging of Dancing Bears which meant I heard barely a word of it, this was the better of the two halves and if you only attend one then this should be it, for it contains two of the more interestingly directed pieces and the best written one in Lenkiewicz’s That Almost Unnameable Lust. Altogether as a six play epic, the work is mightily impressive, the efforts of the ensemble are outstanding and you are struck by a genuine sense of how important these issues really are, and how little they are explored with any depth normally. Themes are recur or at least that resonated the most with me included the overbearing sense of loss for so many of these women, the troubling lack of comprehension of mental health issues that drive women to desperate acts, the disturbing prevalence of self-harm in prisons and the desperate futility of life sentences for victims of domestic violence. Separately, if truth be told, the two sets are a tad underwhelming as there is sometimes not quite enough directorial innovation to overcome the necessary limitations of 30 minute plays and generally speaking, there is a lack of the unifying thread to round off the whole shebang. Both evenings just fizzle out in one of the smaller working spaces and whilst this is clearly a logistics issue, it would have been nice to have been able to applaud the whole company at some point and finish with a bigger flourish or at least with the audience altogether."
1722,1722,Ought To Be Clowns,02/05/2013,Ian,A Man of No Importance, Salisbury Playhouse,"Much like its central character, the charms of A Man of No Importance are gentle and delicate and these remain the watchwords for Gareth Machin’s actor/musician production of this musical for Salisbury Playhouse. Based on a 1994 film and set in early 1960s Dublin, Alfie Byrne is an unassuming bus conductor whose main passion in life is directing his local am-dram society at St Imelda’s. But even that has stagnated with endless runs of The Importance of Being Earnest leaching his creativity so he makes the decision to stage the much more controversial Salome, also by Oscar Wilde, unaware of the tumultuous course of action it will unleash for all concerned. For the weight of the Catholic Church’s disapproval is a heavy load to bear and as the production is condemned for its blasphemy after local busybodies go running to the monsignor, a light has been shone under the genteel façade of this community and exposed homosexual longings, extramarital affairs and illegitimate pregnancies. Alfie is at the centre of it all as it is his secret `desire for his handsome younger workmate Robbie that precipitates the most seismic change but even as he feels his whole world changing from underneath him, surprises lie in store all along the way. Machin’s choice of the actor/musician model pays dividends as the constant onstage presence of at least some number of the 12-strong company replicates that sense of an ever-watchful community from whom it is near-impossible to keep secrets. Such intimacy can be suffocating but it also has its potential rewards and that is something which is movingly explored in Terrence McNally’s book and Lynn Ahrens’s lyrics with their tender messages of acceptance (for some though, not all…) Mark Meadows breathes fragile life into the closeted Alfie with a neatly balanced suggestion both of his emotional naïveté but also the richness of his internal life, given voice here by his interactions with a kind of spirit guide in the form of Oscar Wilde. The default to understated emotion throughout the whole show, including Stephen Flaherty’s Celtic-influenced music, does have a slightly stultifying effect especially in the first half and there’s not always quite enough pace or variation to hook the audience in. But post-interval, things improve significantly. There’s delicious humour from Susannah van den Berg’s inimitable dance of the seven veils, a most moving yet heart-warming song of reminiscence by Roy Weskin’s widower and in Fra Fee’s Robbie and Laura Pitt-Pulford’s Adele, two exciting upcoming talents who will be ones to watch in the world of musical theatre to come."
1723,1723,Ought To Be Clowns,14/02/2010,Ian,Heldenplatz, Arcola,"Continuing the mini German-language season at the Arcola, Heldenplatz is an uncompromising difficult play which has had a troubled existence, especially in playwright Thomas Bernhard’s native Austria. Named for the square in Vienna where Adolf Hitler declared the Anschluβ that annexed Austria to Nazi Germany and marked the beginning of the territorial aggrandisement that led to World War II, this is an excoriating look at the Austrian national character and just how prevalent right-wing sensibilities were in 1938 and persist even in the modern day. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this outraged many Austrians who felt Bernhard was sullying the reputation of their nation, confronting as it does some uncomfortable truths. The play is set in 1988 and the Schuster family and household are reeling from the death of its patriarch. As they prepare for the funeral, and then join for one final meal in his apartment afterwards, these Jewish intellectuals who fled the country once, they have found that little has changed for them: pervasive hatred and anti-Semitic prejudice still abound and they struggle to find their place in a society shorn of illusion. Unfortunately, despite this interesting history and context to the work, the play did not live up to expectations. One of Bernhard’s hallmarks is the endless repetition of the phrases and words , giving a kind of musicality to his plays, and I don’t know if something was lost in the translation (by Meredith Oakes & Andrea Tierney), or the actors need more time to get used to it, or indeed if it is part of the directorial intent (Annie Castledine & Annabel Arden) but it just sounds rather odd. It’s quite arrhythmical, personally I found the repetition is frequently jarring and it is not helped by some curious choices of delivery, rather one-note with no levels, which during the long monologues, struggle to keep the attention. Barbara Marten’s tightly buttoned housekeeper Frau Zittler was the standout for me and along with Clive Mendus as the dead man’s brother, seemed the most comfortable with the language and gave the best deliveries. On a metallic, brushed steel set, on which a long table appears for the second act dinner party, it looks rather post-modern which adds to the alienating effect, and the early scenes borrowed a staging device from the excellent Our Class with the characters not involved in the action, watching from chairs placed at the edge of the stage. They did this dressed in coats marked with the yellow star that identified their race, a chilling reminder of the ghosts haunting this story."
1724,1724,Ought To Be Clowns,06/04/2019,Ian,Follies 2019, National Theatre,"Just a quickie for this revisit to Follies, which remains as perfect a piece of musical theatre as I could hope for. I loved it then but I really love it now, Joanna Riding is just heartbreakingly perfect as Sally, she really brings something to the role that somehow eluded Imelda Staunton (for me at least), Alexander Hanson is superb in tracing Ben’s tragic fall, and Janie Dee and Peter Forbes maintain their stellar work as Phyllis and Buddy (seriously, Dee is a proper showstopper). And as is surely appropriate in Dominic Cooke’s production, ghosts of the past interplay with what we’re seeing from top to bottom. It was great to see Dame Felicity Lott as Heidi, a different but no less affecting proposition than Dame Josephine Barstow (there truly ain’t nothing like a…). And the young talents of Gemma Sutton, Ian McIntosh, Harry Hepple and Christine Tucker are eloquently elegant as the younger incarnations of the central quartet."
1725,1725,Ought To Be Clowns,19/05/2016,mag9l,Blue/Orange, Young Vic,"I seem to be surrounded by people who saw and loved the original production of Blue/Orange, with its extremely tasty cast of Bill Nighy, Andrew Lincoln and Chiwetel Ejiofor, and who love to tell me about it! It was however before my time (here in London at least) and so my first, and only, previous experience of the show was with Tiata Fahdozi’s all-female version at the old Arcola, with a less starry but no less interesting cast of Helen Schlesinger, Esther Hall and Ayesha Antoine. I mention this because it is interesting to me the ways in which people’s journeys with plays are shaped by these interactions, especially when they have been lauded as modern classics. Of the eight, only two are going back to this new production at the Young Vic (it doesn’t seem to be inspiring repeat visits), and the one who has been already didn’t like it. And critics’ responses thus far stretch from Aleks Sierz reconfirming its status as a contemporary classic to Matt Trueman declaring that it hasn’t aged well. So what to make of all of this. I have to say that I didn’t really enjoy Blue/Orange second time around, having been a little disappointed first time too. That time it was partly about expectation not being met but this time, I’m still a little hard-pressed to articulate why Matthew Xia’s production left me cold. It’s attractively and inventively designed by Jeremy Herbert but the play left me unengaged, its credulity feeling overstretched as two white doctors argue for well over two hours over whether a black patient is ready to be discharged."
1726,1726,Ought To Be Clowns,17/08/2011,Ian,Parade, Southwark Playhouse,"Hardly the sunniest of topics for a musical, Jason Robert Brown’s Parade is based on the true 1910s story of Leo Frank, a Jewish businessman who is accused of the rape and murder of Mary Phagan, a 13 year old employee in his factory. How the trial unfolds in Atlanta, Georgia and its impact ripples out, characterises a Deep South rife with virulent anti-Semitism, whipped up by a sensationalist media and fomented by opportunistic politicians and Leo, with his wife Lucille, are swept along with the inescapable tide. This new production is presented in the Vault at Southwark Playhouse, a dark spare space of shadowy arches and echoing sound. It is a beautifully complex score – one which would reward repeated listening I imagine – pulling in influences from a diverse range of sources, evoking emotion well but more crucially constantly pushing the story forward. Because if there’s a weakness it is that the central premise is fairly limited, the same points are made repeatedly in lieu of much by the way of actual drama. But directed by Thom Southerland, the show really sparkles when it centres on the marriage between Brooklynite Leo and Southern gal Lucille, his bookish dullness captured well by Alistair Brookshaw and contrasted by the openness of Laura Pitt-Pulford’s stunningly-voiced wife whose relentless drive to clear his name wakens a new, deeper love between the two. It is interestingly designed by John Risebero, the traverse staging reminiscent of the Menier’s Road Show but Southerland does not really maintain the same level of fluidity to the scenes – everything was always on the move there and constantly using all levels – thus occasionally here there’s awkward pieces of static blocking: it feels rather misjudged to have half your audience watching Leo’s back as he receives his verdict for example. And it always feels like a bit of a shame when small musicals are miked, the acoustics of the space presumably necessitating it here but even so, the sound balance with Michael Bradley’s band wasn’t always quite there. But for the few limitations, the staging is also brilliantly flexible in evoking a huge range of locations both indoors and out, Howard Hudson’s lighting is exceptional here, and there’s some clever use of the platforms at either end and choreography from Tim Jackson to keep a nifty variation to proceedings, maximising the potential of this space. And the ensemble work well throughout the show, bringing life to a vast range of supporting characters: Mark Inscoe’s oleaginous would-be governor and Samuel J Weir’s clear-voiced soldier standing out, as did Terry Doe, wrapping his gorgeous velvety voice around the most suspicious of characters."
1727,1727,Ought To Be Clowns,15/12/2014,Ian,Tiger Country, Hampstead Theatre,"Whilst other people wind down for the end of the year, Nina Raine is certainly keeping busy as her self-penned and self-directed Tiger Country returns to Hampstead Theatre, in advance of Donkey Heart – written by her brother Moses and also directed by her – transferring to Trafalgar Studios 2 in the New Year. Declared one of Hampstead’s most popular commissions, I must confess to being a little surprised to see this 2011 play return as it didn’t stick out as particularly memorable but with the promise of a new cast, I was interested to see how it stacked up nearly four years later. And it seems that some time away has done it some good – the play feels cleaner, sharper and less encumbered with expository dialogue clearing a path through the medical terminology. I don’t know how much the script has been updated or edited but its spin through the state of the modern NHS feels as keenly observed as ever, visiting the stresses it imposes on those who work within it as well as those who use its services. Raine’s production recaptures the frenetic energy of a hospital and its staff at full stretch – metaphorically, physically, emotionally. The new cast have been astutely chosen. Indira Varma brings a wondrous hauteur to surgeon Vashti who is gradually brought to earth by circumstance, humanised beautifully in the most recognisable of ways; Alistair Mackenzie’s registrar skilfully balances professional conduct with personal concern; and Luke Thompson and Nick Hendrix contrast well as young upstarts determined to rise through the ranks. Ruth Everett returns to the role of idealistic Emily through whose eyes we see something – an increasing pragmatism if not disillusionment – of the whole journey."
1728,1728,Ought To Be Clowns,06/03/2012,Ian,All New People, Duke of York’s,"Yet the play is anything but subtle. The cutaways to flashbacks to explain why each of the characters has ended up in this particular circumstance offer amusing cameos from a range of stars, but rob scenes of their dramatic impetus; the destruction of a bead-filled piece of African art sets up some painfully contrived pratfalls; the continued recourse to (sometimes highly amusing) one-liners; the clunky shoehorning in of the show’s title in a moment of cod-philosophy in the final moments. The clumsy construction of the play’s components is frequently laid bare and the lack of finesse in the writing all too apparent. Braff uses broad comedy strokes which speak of his long grounding in sitcom, particularly in his female characterisations. English realtor Emma is meant to be hiring out the house but dippy beyond belief, decides to make rescuing Charlie her mission whilst not hunting for drugs and Kim is a seemingly dim $15,000-a-night escort apparently with hidden depths and talents, but both end up mainly serving the purpose of being the object of much of the humour. Emma is pitched as the type of British stereotype often seen in US sitcoms but weirdly, Eve Myles’ performance very much plays up to this in an uncomfortable amalgam of Bridget Jones and the Ab Fab ladies. Susannah Fielding fares better as Kim, who has some witty lines."
1729,1729,Ought To Be Clowns,11/03/2016,mag9l,Look Back in Anger, Derby Theatre,"Where else to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Look Back in Anger than in the city where it is set, and in the very theatre where the marriage between John Osborne and Pamela Lane came under such strain as to inspire the turbulence of the play that, as conventional wisdom would have it, changed the face of British theatre. Recently, the play has been rarely seen, suffering from the very thing that brought its fame – ever-evolving theatrical tastes – but Sarah Brigham’s production makes it feel startlingly pertinent. The archetypal angry young man, decidedly working class but university educated Jimmy Porter finds himself raging against every aspect of his life in 1956 Derby. The huge social gulf that marks his marriage to the upper middle class Alison, her haughty friend Helena who’s coming to stay, the cramped flat which they share with pal Cliff and the politics they debate ferociously, the music on the radio that isn’t his beloved jazz… And as his frustrations take on an ever more vicious turn, a love triangle emerges that shatters what fragile peace there is. As a newcomer to Look Back in Anger, I was surprised at just how vital it felt. Jimmy’s hang-ups about class could be considered a factor that dates the play but certainly not fatally, and it crackles with life in the way that Osborne explores love and sex in marriage, the way in which both men and women seek to exploit and engineer power dynamics to secure their own ends, be that mutual happiness or mutually assured devastation. And the sense of living in a nation crippled by the actions of a perversely-minded establishment is one that remains sadly relevant today. Brigham feels very much alive to these nuances and so cultivates a sense of the almost abstract in collaboration with Neil Irish’s design, open-plan domestic life suspended in a metaphysical space. The rumbles of Ivan Stott’s soundscape remind us of the lives going on all around them and Arnim Friess’ lighting undulates beautifully, softening in the more sensitive moments to really draw us in. And the cast of five discharge their roles well.  Patrick Knowles’ Jimmy is a force of nature but an undoubted tormented soul with it, unable to deal with a world that for him, is both changing too much and not changing at all. Augustina Seymour’s Alison strikes an interesting position as his wife, a suggestion of her own closeness to Cliff complicating the picture as much as her own rebellion against her family and in some ways, hurt and anger seems as a good a bond as any for this pair. Jimmy Fairhurst’s Cliff and Daisy Badger’s Helena are also both well played, as it Stott’s brief cameo as Alison’s father. "
1730,1730,Ought To Be Clowns,17/10/2014,Ian,Memphis, Shaftesbury Theatre,"Though much of the US civil rights movement’s achievements came through political means, this time of huge shift in American society was also underpinned by significant cultural change and it is this that the Tony-award-winning show Memphis focuses on, in exploring how white radio DJ Huey Calhoun sent shockwaves over the airwaves of this Southern city in the 1950s by ignoring the entrenched racial divisions and playing ‘race’ music for all to hear. And as rock and roll began to capture the attention of the nation, so too was Huey’s attention completely captured by the soulful energy of upcoming singer Felicia Farrell and the underground blues club in which she performs (which belongs to her brother). That she is black and he is not doesn’t matter to him but it sure as hell does to everyone else (they may sing that ‘Everybody Wants To Be Black On A Saturday night’ but there are still laws preventing mixed marriage) and it is this that provides the dramatic heft to Joe DiPietro’s book, such as it is, to this musical that otherwise puts its focus squarely on the music. And what an unexpected place that music comes from – David Bryan, who just happens to be Bon Jovi’s keyboard player – has compiled a fully original score which pulls in influences from Motown-flecked pop, gospel, R&B and 80s power ballads naturally (I mean, look at the guy’s hair!) – it’s highly tuneful if not instantly catchy but delivered with the conviction it is here, it demands the attention and will doubtless reward relistening (if not rewatching as well ;-)) As it is the performances that really elevate the show into a special piece of musical theatre. Beverley Knight continues her development on the stage with some remarkably intense acting and singing work as Felicia, a woman caught between the love of a good man (no matter how wrong he might be for her) and the unimaginable excitement that a bona fide musical career might hold. Killian Donnelly’s affable charm is a good fit for the rough edges of Huey, the show might be about white men making black music successful but there’s no doubting that it is her strength that is needed to save him. Their chemistry is strong together and the support around them on all sides is just magnificent under Christopher Ashley’s fast-paced direction."
1731,1731,Ought To Be Clowns,18/11/2015,mag9l,Close To You: Bacharach Reimagined, Criterion,"From the moment you enter the Criterion Theatre to see the amazing patchworked carpet effect of Christine Jones and Brett Banakis’ set design with its onstage sofas – some even suspended in mid-air – it’s clear to see that there’s something special about Close To You Bacharach Reimagined. Transferred from a successful summer run at the Menier Chocolate Factory (where it had the slightly different title of What’s It All About?), the show now offers its shimmering warmth and endless charm to get us through the darkening autumn nights. And that patchwork effect is one that mirrors the nature of the show itself. Conceived by Kyle Riabko and David Lane Seltzer, Close To You offers up fresh reinterpretations of Burt Bacharach’s considerable songbook but rather than a straight set of song after song, the material is woven into a rich tapestry of medleys, repeated refrains, lyrical connections and snatches of melodies – an audacious reimagining but one that is hugely effective as it acts as a reminder of the extraordinary body of work Bacharach has composed with lyricist Hal David among others. Steven Hoggett’s direction captures much of this fresh, contemporary feel with hints of his customary flowing choreography threaded through the performance, bathed in the wonderfully warm glow of Tim Lutkin’s lighting design with its myriad lampshades. And though there’s no formal narrative in the show, there’s always a strong impression of the stories behind the songs by the vastly talented company of singing multi-instrumentalists led by Riabko – Daniel Bailen, Greg Coulson, Anastacia McCleskey, Stephanie McKeon, Renato Paris, and James Williams."
1732,1732,Ought To Be Clowns,06/05/2018,Ian,Worth A Flutter, Hope,"A curious one, this. The first half of Michael Head’s Worth A Flutter is full of the kind of broad, sitcom-like humour of which I’m no real fan. But after the interval, a more thoughtful strand to his writing emerges and with surreal touches threaded throughout both, a fascinating, if slightly flawed, production is the result. Set in and around a Bermondsey greasy spoon, the play follows the romantic trials and tribulations of Matt and Sam, as they both pursue caff owner Helen. Matt’s got a high-maintenance fiancée who is an uncontrollable flirt and Sam is deeply, unhappily married but both see a way out, over bacon sandwiches and drily witty conversation. Trouble is, they don’t know about each other.  Head himself plays the brash and loud Matt in the bawdier first half, espousing a chatty blokiness which may not have been my own cup of tea but had many in the audience guffawing. And rattling through brief caricatures of the other people in his life, Lucy Pinder and Paul Danan acquit themselves decently while Clare McNamara’s Helen shines but her enigmatic aura."
1733,1733,Ought To Be Clowns,24/08/2013,Ian,Pipe Dream, Union,"As unlikely as it seems, there are still Rodgers and Hammerstein shows that have never been performed in the UK and in the hope of unearthing a little gem, Sasha Regan’s Union Theatre took on the 1955 flop Pipe Dream and given it the chamber treatment. Some of the songs may be familiar from State Fair which was recently very well-revived by the Finborough and unfortunately, it’s a comparison which does Pipe Dream few favours, as I couldn’t help but feel that this show had little to really commend it and pretty much deserves the obscurity in which it has languished. Based on two John Steinbeck novels, Sweet Thursday and Cannery Row, the show focuses on the deadbeat end of society – prostitutes and layabouts populate this Depression-era world, an innovation which popular wisdom would have was too outrageous for 1950s audiences. The problem seems more to be the coyness with which Rodgers and Hammerstein treat this though – Suzy the heroine of the show works in the local whorehouse yet the conservatism of the writing never explains it properly, and this cripples her burgeoning relationship with marine biologist Doc which forms the backbone of the show, their pairing stuttering and staggering over obstacles which are never quite clear. Regan’s production isn’t constrained by such morality and so is able to have fun in creating the bordello run by Virge Gilchrist’s Fauna, but this exacerbates the issues in the book which aren’t amended to reflect the explicit referencing to the girls’ employment. And alongside this sits a daft series of plot twists whose improbabilities feel tiresome rather than charming, making this a show that rarely engaged me in any meaningful way. Kieran Brown does his best as what has to be one of the oddest leading man parts out there, far too passive a character to lead us out, and Charlotte Scott’s Suzy likewise makes a decent fist of her tomboyish part."
1734,1734,Ought To Be Clowns,15/12/2011,Ian,The Importance of Being Earnest – a new musical, Riverside Studios,"Douglas Livingstone’s adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s classic retains much of the original, but re-sites the action into the 1920s. This offers a world of opportunity on the music and dance side, but also seems rather apt in terms of the increasing empowerment of women – though necessarily still limited – in dealing with their affairs. And the music from Adam McGuinness and Zia Moranne has a nice simplicity which never tries to do too much or make too much of an impact. For the songs really do serve an integral purpose here, taking advantage of our familiarity with the play to further build on and enrich these characters and scenarios to great effect. Iqbal Khan’s production thus sings with clarity. Samal Blak’s simple set allows for an effective shift to the pastoral, Debbie Astell’s dignified choreography is delicately employed with restraint, but these just form the backdrop to a well-spoken, and sung, rendition of this play which is alive to the added value, both emotionally and comically, that the music brings. This is best exemplified by the young women: the excellent Anya Murphy as a wildly flirtatious Gwendolen and a persuasive Flora Spencer-Longhurst as a Cecilia longing for real experience – her song ‘Wicked’ provides real new insight into this take on the character – whose confrontation in the Hertfordshire garden is extremely wittily rendered in the pointed ‘Dear Friends’. Though a big selling point here, it is often easy to forget that Lady Bracknell really isn’t in the play a great deal. Gyles Brandreth has taken Queen Mary as his reference point and it really does work. Finely upholstered in pinstripe tailoring, he glides around like a stately battleship and with a careful vocal performance and cleverly pitched delivery, he makes the most of all of Lady B’s withering lines. His songs tend towards the patter-style which suits his capabilities and it was altogether rather well done. Susie Blake and Edward Petherbridge as an adorable Miss Prism and Dr Chasuble really do great work though, their duet ‘It All Began In A Garden’ is a delightfully sweet take on the birds and the bees, but Blake is never better than in the hugely revelatory ’It Was My Muse’ which wraps up the story extremely neatly."
1735,1735,Ought To Be Clowns,17/10/2012,Ian,Stacy, New Diorama,"Stacy is actually about Rob. And his best friend Stacy, and her flatmate Shona too. But mainly about Rob. For when a misguided drunken shag with Stacy later leads into another encounter with the more inexperienced Shona, it is Rob’s life that is thrown under the microscope in this hour-long monologue by Jack Thorne, as he delivers a stream of consciousness of epic proportions, full of amusing family anecdotes and wheedling self-justification, his unique world-view and several trips into a past which emerges as disturbingly warped. Thorne’s writing literally zings with authenticity, packed full intensely familiar details – the evils of cheap blue plastic bags, the messiness that so often characterises ill-advised hook-ups, the appeal of trashy TV – to make this character a compellingly vivid and realistic depiction of disillusioned 21st century young adulthood. And Tim Dorsett really gets under the skin of Rob, a charmingly winsome presence who revels in the role of raconteur –playing beautifully off of our responses to some of the more ribald details – with a genuine warmth coming through his comedic persona too. Which makes it all the more powerful when the warning notes of uncertainty start to sound and then the siren blares at full volume. Suddenly armed with new knowledge, the audience is thrust into a world which is now much more morally complex. Thorne’s writing continues in much the same vein but is it still OK to laugh? Are we still allowed to find any empathy with this man? As with the proliferation of jokes about Jimmy Savile, there’s a great uneasiness in the air as shocked silence meets stifled sniggers. In a clever move, a projector accompanies Rob onstage and constantly flicks through images which – sometimes unwittingly and sometimes horrendously graphically – reveal something of his troubled sub-conscious.   From its sexually frank but wryly comic beginnings, Stacy builds into a blistering intensity. By presenting and maintaining such a recognisable normality both through Thorne’s writing and through Dorsett’s performance, there’s a bleak reminder that the shades of grey exist in us all. The ambiguity that accompanies the bad decisions may frustrate some, but ultimately has a deadening beliveability. Alongside Stacy, the AllthePigs theatre company are taking the opportunity to showcase work from their First-time-writers’ initiative, as each performance of the show is preceded by a short play from a writer who is new to writing for the stage. Tonight saw Cordelia O’Neill’s The Stolen Inches receiving its first airing, its depiction of a highly troubled family dynamic proving an effective pre-echo to the main show. If it tries to achieve a little too much in its short running time with its dipping into the past as well as presenting five narrative streams – mother and father who talk both together and separately plus their two sons – O’Neill probes an interesting premise of the impact of a surprise child on all members of a family and the repercussions of their attitudes across their lifetimes."
1736,1736,Ought To Be Clowns,23/06/2010,Ian,Dangerous, Above the Stag,"We unforgivably had the giggles for much of this show. Stuffing the guy's face with chocolates, waxing lyrical about how beautiful Bournemouth was, bizarre audience member talking throughout, it all just kept setting us off.By and large agree with your comments, not an altogether successful adaptation. It needed to go further and be a bit more inventive, a trainee priest for Madame de Tourvel? Too easy. Giving Marcus/Merteuil a more convincing reason for his actions (it made even less sense since they'd already shagged).Would rather see another attempt to revive the Hampton production"
1737,1737,Ought To Be Clowns,11/12/2019,Ian,A Kind of People, Royal Court,"Opening with the kind of house party you’d be quite happy to end up at after a few drinks down the pub, you can kinda see where the Royal Court is coming from in programming Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti’s A Kind of People over Christmas. But as in the tradition of all good parties – and most good plays – something goes wrong, conflict must arise, and any sense of festive cheer is soon Scrooged away. Bhatti’s play is set in the bosom of a tight-knit multicultural, working class community, with mixed-race couple Gary and Nicky at its heart. With friends and family forever knocking on their door, their home doesn’t lack for conviviality but it is lacking space – they’re bursting out of the seams of their council flat. But Gary’s up for a promotion at work, with a serious pay rise, so things could be looking up.  Except of course, they don’t. Gary’s boss Victoria rocks up at one of their parties and makes a tit of herself, the ramifications of which threaten the very consensus on which their lives are built, exposing the frailties of daring to be aspirational in Brexit Britain. It’s a searing look at the precariousness of so much of our lives, and particularly how helpless we can feel in the face of external pressures.  Bhatti picks apart social cohesion with an almost distressing sense of purpose, tackling issues of race from all kinds of angles, raising questions about integration and insularity without ever providing any pat answers. There’s a strong theme too about the importance of education, how the choice of school can stack children’s chances and the lengths parents will go in order to game the system. "
1738,1738,Ought To Be Clowns,20/02/2017,mag9l,The Wild Party, The Other Palace,"There’s no doubting the visual flair that choreographer Drew McOnie is able to conjure in his work – In The Heights and Jesus Christ Superstar being just two recent examples – and so it is no coincidence that his move into directing has begun with dance-heavy pieces. Strictly Ballroom lit up the stage at the West Yorkshire Playhouse before Christmas and now The Wild Party opens up the programming at The Other Palace, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s rebranded St James Theatre. Michael John LaChiusa’s musical version is not the first adaptation of Joseph Moncure March’s epic poem to hit London this year – that title goes to the Hope Theatre’s two hander from last month. But it does have its own tunes presented as a vaudeville, a real mish-mash of every 1920s style you can think of and more, which makes for a bold and brash evening – especially as performed by this lavishly assembled ensemble – but ultimately, one of little staying power.  March’s jazz-age tale of a tempestuous couple holding a gathering to end all gatherings allows for a real parade of vivid caricatures to come passing through in search of gin, blow, sex and some defining characteristic or other. Sometimes this works, as in the hypnotic moves of Gloria Obianyo and Genesis Lynea’s gender-flipping couple, and Dex Lee’s animalistic sexuality but sometimes, you’re left craving more than the shallowness that the writing too often falls back on."
1739,1739,Ought To Be Clowns,18/05/2017,Ian,The Addams Family, New Wimbledon,"Sad to say, what I’m saying is that I was not a fan of The Addams Family at all. After a cracking opening number which promises oh so much, Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice’s book grinds to a juddering halt in a first half which does nothing but interminably set the scene. And Andrew Lippa’s score offers little respite as it fails to really nail any definitive sense of identity and ends up really rather forgettable. Things do pick up a tad post-interval but it’s too little too late by then. It all could have been so much better. The Addams Family are an iconic set of characters, previously immortalised on cartoon strip, on television and on film, a legacy which goes some way to explaining the commercial success of the show on Broadway in the face of a scathing critical reception. But classic characters need classic storytelling and here, they’re marooned in a schmaltzy neverland which captures nothing of the golden age, nor has anything to say to audiences today. The story hinges on Carrie Hope Fletcher’s Wednesday hooking up with the ‘normal’ Lucas, played by Oliver Ormson, but there’s zero narrative tension in the plot (or credibility – why Wednesday is attracted to him remains a mystery), such as it is, and the focus on Lucas’ family is misjudged, distracting from the whole raison d’être of a show called The Addams Family about the Addams Family. But even then, when the spotlight shines on the ooky and the kooky, the results are less spooky than shockingly dull."
1740,1740,Ought To Be Clowns,27/01/2017,mag9l,Escaped Alone, Royal Court,"There’s something delicious about seeing the Caryl Churchill’s Escaped Alone return to the Royal Court before heading out to New York and then a UK tour. It’s also testament to James MacDonald’s production that the quartet of actors who originated their parts have all returned – Linda Bassett, Deborah Findlay, Kika Markham and June Watson, marvels every one."
1741,1741,Ought To Be Clowns,30/08/2013,Ian,Relatively Speaking, Wyndhams,"It does seem that Alan Ayckbourn has been officially anointed national treasure status by the critical establishment but his charms have largely eluded me, appealing more to a middle-aged greying sensibility that trips merrily down the middle of the road. But the ease with which I was able to get one of the cheaper tickets for the balcony of the Wyndhams theatre, one of the more intimate West End houses and so a great bargain tip, for the final day of the run of Relatively Speaking meant a cheeky matinée was in the offing. The story is one of his archetypal mistaken identity farces – Ginny has decided that Greg is the man for her even though it has only been a month and so she nips off to the country to end her affair with an older man. But she tells Greg she is going to visit her parents and in a moment of passion, he decides to follow her in order to ask for her father’s hand. What follows is confusion at the enduring mix-ups, exacerbated by the English reticence to confront the obvious and thus avoid social embarrassment.  Thing is though, the 1967 play is set in aspic like a relic in a museum. The attitudes towards female sexuality and infidelity are very much of their time and asking them to sustain the dramatic momentum of the writing becomes a huge, unlikely ask. Lindsay Posner corrals his assets into a perky little ensemble who do everything that is required of them but there’s a distinct veneer of artificiality about the whole affair, disbelief has to be completely suspended from the off and that makes it far less funny."
1742,1742,Ought To Be Clowns,01/03/2011,Ian,Avenue Q, Richmond Theatre,             
1743,1743,Ought To Be Clowns,11/12/2010,Ian,Just So, Tabard,"Written in the mid 1980s by George Stiles (music) and Anthony Drewe (lyrics), this is actually the professional London premiere of this show after a successful 2006 revival in Chichester which featured Julie Atherton. Director Andrew Keates has aimed big with this production, the biggest ever at the Tabard, which celebrates both the 25th anniversary of the show and the Tabard itself. Just So pulls together five of Rudyard Kipling’s famous stories into one epic journey through the jungle as the Elephant’s Child and the Kolokolo Bird, guided by the wise Eldest Magician, travel together to stop the evil crab Pau Amma from flooding everything and on the way meet all sorts of weird and wonderful creatures as they learn to face their fears, be truly courageous and the real value of friendship. With a live band and a cast of eleven, the story is brought vividly to life on the stage of the Tabard in what makes for a most entertaining family musical. At the heart of the story is the inquisitive Elephant Child, played with wide-eyed and fresh-faced innocence by Lee Greenaway and his journey with the more worldly-wise and -weary Kolokolo Bird, portrayed with a delicious sardonic Scottishness by Lisa Baird. They are brilliant together and the way in which their companionship develops is lovely, the moment when he finally takes her hand is beautifully observed. Yet they also show the difficulties of maintaining friendships, allowing for the two musical highlights to come in the second act, the rueful ‘Does The Moment Ever Come?’ is sung well by Greenaway but my favourite is the gorgeous ‘Wait A Bit’, where the Kolokolo Bird admonishes herself for not fulfilling her potential and learn to fly: it is a genuinely touching song and delivered with real style and passion by Baird. But what is also lovely about the show is that it really allows its supporting characters the room to develop and flourish as they gain the characteristics that make them unique creatures. So true to Kipling’s storytelling, we learn how the leopard got its spots, why the rhino’s skin is wrinkled and how the elephant got its trunk. The ensemble was strong across the board, but I did particularly enjoy Stuart Douglas-James’ Rhino and Lewis Barnshaw’s singing stove. And Ian Knauer’s guiding influence as the Eldest Magician is carried with a strong vocal performance. Magnus Gilljam’s musical direction is nicely energetic, capturing the lightheartedness of many of the songs as well as the beautiful balladry, Christopher Hone’s set design uses the space of the Tabard well and Phyllida Crowley-Smith’s choreography is equally well-suited, filling the stage to great effect. And any show that introduces a tap dance number, especially when delivered by a zebra and a giraffe, has to be a winner!"
1744,1744,Ought To Be Clowns,17/12/2017,Ian,Romantics Anonymous, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,"Like the squares of chocolates handed out for us to magically access automatic translation, there’s a bittersweet note to much of Romantics Anonymous. And it is perhaps predictably that Emma Rice scores one of her biggest hits on Bankside with a musical that couldn’t be more Emma Rice if it tried. As it is, it fits perfectly into the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, shaking up the established order once again as she brings amplification and neon lights along with the huge generosity of spirit of this show, uncompromising to the end in her relationship with the Globe. Romantics Anonymous was adapted by Rice from the French-Belgian film Les Émotifs Anonymes, and takes a wonderfully Gallic spin on your typical romantic comedy. Jean-René has inherited a chocolate factory, Angélique is a chocolatier par excellence in need of a job, they seem perfectly suited for each other but both are chronically, painfully shy. She faints if she has to speak to people, he has precisely zero confidence and even in the act of finally striking up a relationship together, both working and personal, their awkwardness is a constant threat to their happiness.  I loved it. I really really loved it. There’s an almost indescribable joyous spirit permeating the whole show as whimsy is counterbalanced with worry, humour with heartbreak, as we remain unsure to the end whether this pair will get their happy ending. Dominic Marsh (wonderfully nerdy – loved the ctrl alt delete gag) and Carly Bawden (who works with actual chocolate whilst singing) capture so much of the emotional heart of the piece, aided by a yearning score from US composers Christopher Dimond and Michael Kooman (album plug!) that shimmers in its loveliness. What really makes this musical fly though is its lightness of spirit. Even in its potentially darkest and saddest moments, the multi-roling ensemble are on hand to deliver a wide range of hilarious supporting characters, joyful dance routines and pointed jokes about manspreading or being strong and stable. And as if there were any doubts about quality, Joanna Riding is one of the members of that company, alongside great turns from the likes of Lauren Samuels and Marc Antolin and an outrageously entertaining Gareth Snook. C’est magnifique."
1745,1745,Ought To Be Clowns,16/05/2019,Ian,Testament, Hope Theatre,"Bold as you like, Chalk Line’s Testament is a breath of bracingly fresh air into the Hope Theatre with its blend of physical theatre, metaphysical narrative and contemporary issue-baiting. Plays about mental health, especially in young men, are hot currency at the moment as people try and do something, anything, to help tackle the single biggest killer of men under the age of 45 in the UK. And Sam Edmunds’ drama feels like a powerful addition to that effort. Max wakes up in his hospital bed in a bit of a fug. Having survived a car crash that killed his girlfriend a while back, he’s just tried to take his own life and though he has failed, he’s suffering from brain trauma. The upshot to that is that he’s forgotten what’s happened, he still believes his girl Tess is alive; the downside is that his medical condition is dire and his brother has to convince him to undergo a procedure that will make him lose her all over again. It’s a vividly effective way of portraying the pole-axing effects of grief and the desperation it provokes to cling on to even the most destructive of memories. Edmunds complicates this thought process by introducing Jesus and Lucifer into Max’s psyche and we see them philosophising and debating medical ethics while in the ‘real world’, we watch Max’s brother Chris talk through the cold realities of the necessary surgery with a doctor waiting for consent to be given. Co-directors Edmund and William Harrison clearly relish the challenges of the piece and fill it with some brilliantly bold decision-making. Harrison’s sound design with Alan Walden’s lighting take no prisoners at all in creatively suggesting the torment of post-trauma recovery, with haunting flashbacks to that fatal crash. Max’s condition is evoked mainly through an angular physicality, given visceral life by Nicholas Shalebridge in a ferociously committed performance that sees him pin the audience down with his uncompromising directness.  There’s also excellent work from William Shackleton as Chris, a gentler soothing presence – honestly, even the worst news would seem bearable if he held your hand and told it to you – albeit one who is not unproblematic, as the pieces of the non-linear puzzle here start to fall into place. There’s fun too in a genius nightclub scene, you can literally smell the Lynx Africa and taste the WKD Blue, everything I imagined straight clubbing to be!"

1747,1747,Ought To Be Clowns,04/02/2010,Ian,Richard III, Riverside Studios,"So after a nice break away from London, and seven whole days without a play, 2010’s theatregoing resumed with a trip to Richard III at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. Part of a season of plays entitled Desire and Destruction presented by the Love and Madness company, an ensemble of 10 actors are covering 3 plays around these ever-resonant themes, of which Richard III is the second to start (Fool For Love opened last week). One of Shakespeare’s most celebrated works, Richard III is the story of the physically deformed Duke of Gloucester, a fiercely ambitious prince of the House of York whose hunger for the throne leads him down a Machiavellian path of endless murder, betrayals and general naughtiness as nothing will stop him from gaining what he so desires, even though it lays so far from him. Shakespeare played fast and loose with history in writing this play and so it lends itself to interpretation quite nicely (this production is presented in modern dress), being much more a study in uncontrolled ambition and the power of ‘spin’ in order to manipulate situations both publicly and privately to one’s own good. Carl Prekopp does an admirable job, playing him with less of a hunchback and more of a palsy-related disability, but capturing perfectly the conspiratorial tone of the manipulative man on the make and getting the level of cruel comedy just right: I loved the way he constantly slunk around in the shadows, whether on the fringes of his family or the court. His descent into madness and paranoia is perhaps a touch overplayed, his physical performance becoming almost reptilian, but still convincing. He is ably supported by an excellent cast, all of whom double up with roles, and sometimes more. I was most impressed with Jonathan Warde’s workrate, switching between three roles effortlessly in the first half alone, his taciturn executioner Tyrell was a particular delight and strangely fanciable(!), Simon Yadoo’s oleaginous Buckingham was highly enjoyable to watch and Candida Benson brought a real emotional depth to her Queen Elizabeth, fighting to save her remaining children from Richard’s clutches. Matt Sim’s fur-coated, darkly prophetic Margaret was something of an acquired taste, a bit jarring at first but slowly making more sense and it is unfortunate that Sadie Frost has Lady Anne, who makes the most inexplicable decision to marry the murderer of her husband and her father-in-law, as her only real contribution to the show, an odd character not helped by Frost’s rather emotionless reading, I wanted a bit more variance in her speaking voice, something that may come with time. The staging is quite simplistic, just a conference table on wheels and some chairs being endlessly reconfigured which worked; the monochromatic palate also looked good, with the only colour being red, whether through the atmospheric lighting or the tie around Richard’s neck. The climactic battle however was played out in an interesting manner with movement and music being used to great effect visually; this was however completely at the expense of being able to hear the language so some sound balance issues need to be looked at there."
1748,1748,Ought To Be Clowns,22/02/2018,Ian,Foul Pages, Hope,"It is easy to slip into reverence with artistic representations of William Shakespeare, such is his storied reputation but pleasingly, there’s little of that on display here in Robin Hooper’s Foul Pages. Imagining the man behind the myth, Hooper presents the Bard as a hard-working theatre professional, beset by controversies, split loyalties and tough decisions – the Vicky Featherstone of his day if you will. His Rita, Sue… moment comes as a result of needing to secure the patronage of new king James I, not just for his own career prospects but to save the imprisoned Sir Walter Raleigh, a close personal friend of his collaborator the Countess of Pembroke. But to please the king is to disappoint some of his actors and in the Wiltshire estate where they’re all sequestered whilst London is riddled with plague, the consequences of puncturing actors’ egos become all too real.  What Hooper does well is to capture the spirit of these theatre-makers as something exciting and anarchic in contemporary society and director Matthew Parker emphasises this throughout – punctuating scenes with stabs of pulsing electro, ensuring punkish touches adorn Rachael Ryan’s costumes. And the exhilarating sexual charge that is riven through this company makes its emotional connections in the opening hour a fascinating study. The shift to something darker, more serious for the play’s climax doesn’t quite crackle with the same energy – this is a show with a talking dog after all, fearlessly funny work from James King. But Ian Hallard’s Will and Clare Bloomer’s Mary are engaging as they wrestle over rewrites of As You Like It, as are Olivia Onyehara as sparky maid Peg and Tom Vanson’s expressive monarch, and in its exploration of artistic compromise and the perils of pursuing both sexual and political freedom, Foul Pages makes for strange eventful history."
1749,1749,Ought To Be Clowns,28/10/2018,Ian,Macbeth, RSC at the Barbican,"Its enduring popularity on school curricula means we will probably never be free of it but in a year when both the National Theatre and the RSC have swung and missed with modern takes on Macbeth, surely it is time to give it a rest. Rufus Norris’s post-apocalyptic production felt unmoored and lacklustre in the unforgiving Olivier and now taking up residency at the Barbican, Polly Findlay’s interpretation for the RSC similarly lacks clarity and intent. There’s plenty of ambition here and it is tempting to see the influence of a certain Dutch auteur (barefeet actors, clocks counting down to deaths…). But the over-riding aspect of Findlay’s direction is its headlong speed as it hurtles through a cut-down version of the text. Too much has been sacrificed here in the name of accessibility with precious little time given to allow emotional beats to play out, for motivations to be understood, the hurly-burly rules.  Christopher Eccleston feels ill at ease as Macbeth, a convincingly rough-hewn soldier but unable to breathe any poetry into his verse reading. And much as I love Niamh Cusack, her Lady Macbeth is ill-served here by the relentless of a pace that constantly feels like it is trying to hurry her off. What does work in an intriguing way is the forefronting of Michael Hodgson’s Porter, a constant foreboding presence, chalking up deaths, running the vacuum up and down, even lending a murderous hand. And there’s all sorts of similar details that tease with the promise of what might have been. The way in which children are used to amp up the spookiness – the witches as little girls nods neatly to The Shining and the final image of the bloody cycle restarting is powerfully done. Lizzie Powell’s lighting carving epic tableaux out of the liminal space of Fly Davis’ design. And the clanking horror movie-stylings of Christopher Shutt’s sound and Rupert Cross’ music may ultimately prove overused but are still effective."
1750,1750,Ought To Be Clowns,10/03/2017,mag9l,Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf, Harold Pinter,"The irony of the not unreasonable (don’t @ me) ‘no eating during the performance’ request blowing up around Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, is that a far more egregious act is being waged in the bars of the Harold Pinter Theatre where no ice is served in drinks purchased after 7.20pm. Imagine paying theatre prices for a G&T with no ice…the tears of George and Martha just wouldn’t stand for it. Not that there’s much they don’t stand for in Edward Albee’s excoriating play, receiving an exemplary production here from James Macdonald. Over late night drinks with an unsuspecting younger couple, George and Martha release themselves from the fustiness of East Coast academic life by drinking hard and playing harder, twisted games making the black comedy darken into abject despair as the state of the marriages here are laid bare, warts and all. It’s a sensational piece of writing that barely seems to have aged since its 1962 debut, such is the sharpness of its caustic wit as Martha spouts forth her bitterness at life-plans gone awry and George’s morose demeanour gives way to no less wickedly pointed vitriol. And the more youthful visitors Nick and Honey’s apparently golden relationship is also exposed as already tarnished, its hollowness gleefully seized upon by their vengeful hosts as ever-flowing booze loosens lips and lowers inhibitions. As Martha and George, Imelda Staunton and Conleth Hill are in staggering good form. Her intense ferocity is mesmerising whether scything into her husband or slinkily grinding up against her handsome guest. And his more contained energy is a wonderful contrast, unpredictable and dangerous – even as they expertly hint at the depths of the twisted emotion that irrevocably connects them, they keep you constantly on the edge of your seat. "
1751,1751,Ought To Be Clowns,17/09/2018,Ian,God of Carnage, Theatre Royal Bath,"A criminally short run for Theatre Royal Bath’s production of God of Carnage, especially since it has er’ from Downton and ‘im from The Royle Family and ‘her from Sherlock and *swoon* Nigel Lindsay in it. I was barely able to fit it into the diary but a sweeping trip to the West Country at the weekend meant I got in just before the final show. Yasmine Reza’s ferociously savage take on middle class mores was seen in the West End a decade ago and appears to have lost none of its bite. As two well-to-do families come together to discuss a playground incident between their children, the thin veneer of respectability as they tiptoe around the delicacy of the situation is soon ripped away and a real ugliness revealed.  The cast of Lindsay Posner’s production may have visibility but there’s nowhere to hide here, and nor do they need to as they each delve deep into the drinks cabinet and come up increasingly short in the integrity stakes. As the balance in the argument shift, so too do the alliances, husband against wife, three against one, childishness abides."
1752,1752,Ought To Be Clowns,09/02/2019,Ian,We’ve Got Each Other, VAULT Festival,"When Paul O’Donnell grows up, I’m pretty sure he’ll age into The Drowsy Chaperone’s Man in Chair, And now I’ve got my niche musical reference out of the way, we can turn to the plethora of injokes and satirical jabs that are scattered throughout his inspired one-man all singing, all dancing Bon Jovi musical spectacular We’ve Got Each Other.  Well it would be a spectacle, except he hasn’t quite got the budget to mount the whole thing. So he’s talking us through it, asking us to use the power of our imagination to fill in the gaps as he narrates the story to us under the glow of an IKEA floorlamp (cos he can’t afford a follow-spot…). It’s a ridiculously, almost criminally simple set-up, but one which pays huge dividends in its generosity of spirit and in O’Donnell’s pitch-perfect delivery. His dry deadpan approach calls to mind something of the undiminished brilliance of Caroline Aherne, full of an affectionate kind of sarcasm which is pointed nonetheless. And as he skips through the story of his musical, it’s impossible not to get swept up in his increasing enthusiasm, it’s one for the theatre nerd in all of us."
1753,1753,Ought To Be Clowns,13/02/2017,mag9l,La Ronde, Bunker Theatre,"Sex sells. And so Arthur Schnitzler’s 1897 play of 10 interlinked intimate encounters has proven enduringly popular over the years – adapted for the gays, for fans of musicals, for Charlie Spencer’s libido… – and now Max Gill has taken a decidedly 21st century gender-neutral approach to La Ronde for the opening salvo in the Bunker’s second season. A giant roulette wheel dominates Frankie Bradshaw’s set and as it spins, it is thus left to chance to dictate who of the company – 2 women, 2 men – will tag in to play the next two-hander (or not as the case may be, the wheel refusing to land on one of the actors on press night).  So from Premier Inns in Hillingdon to doctors’ surgeries, bland apartments to hot and sweaty lifts, all sorts of shenanigans play out. Tinder dates gone awry, ex-lovers unable to resist each other, sex workers going about their business, marriages gone stale, the unpredictable nature of the casting means that everything is up for grabs here and between them, Alexander Vlahos, Amanda Wilkin, Lauren Samuels and Leemore Marrett Jr do a fine job, whether it is Vlahos slipping into black PVC hotpants or Wilkins nailing each and every one of her vivid characterisations. But this fluidity also comes at a cost. The approach opens up the awesome possibility of over 3,000 different iterations of the play but from a pure storytelling point of view, the emphasis on variety detracts from the specificity that any actor might build up in their consecutive scenes. And given the rules of the game, that the departing actor is exempt from the next, it means that any scene that is played same-sex is necessarily followed by a coupling of opposite sexes (ie every lesbian will always then go on to have sex with a man…), thus mitigating against its exploration of the full complexity of the sexuality spectrum."
1754,1754,Ought To Be Clowns,19/11/2014,Ian,Behind the Beautiful Forevers, National Theatre,"Rufus Norris is set to take over the artistic directorship of the National Theatre in April next year but makes an admirably bold move in Behind the Beautiful Forevers. Adapted by David Hare from the 2012 non-fiction work of the same name by Katherine Boo, who spent three years living, investigating and writing about life in the Indian slum of Annawadi which lies in the shadow of Mumbai airport, it’s sprawling and scrappy yet epic and enlightening as it elucidates something of what it means to be this far below the poverty line. It is rarely comfortable viewing but its unflinching and unsentimental approach feels essential. Whether accurate or overemphasised, a strongly matriarchal societal structure emerges in this version of Annawadi as wives and mothers seize the initiative in the face of feckless husbands and sheer necessity. Which results in the pleasing preponderance of excellent female roles – Stephanie Street’s Sikh Asha is the fixer for the entire neighbourhood, putting work at the expense of even a special birthday party her kids have put on; Thusitha Jayasundera’s crippled Fatima is a cyclone of malevolent anger that dominates her household; and Meera Syal’s practical Zehrunisa looks set to secure her family’s future out of the slum with some canny deal-making. It is interesting to see how poverty actually has something of a levelling effect in terms of gender here – where resourcefulness is king, it is simply the most enterprising who wear the crown, man or woman. It is only when they have to deal with the outside world that traditional roles have to be assumed and it is quite distressing to see how Zehrunisa has to repress almost every natural instinct to present an acceptable figure at the police station in order to gain access to visiting hours, Syal almost shrinking herself under the headscarf. Likewise, financial independence comes at a high price for Asha, Street exuding a steely flintiness as her idealistic daughter discovers and challenges her actions. But it’s not just the women under the spotlight here. We see young men like Shane Zaza’s Abdul and Hiran Abeysekera’s Sunil fighting to make their mark in the garbage collecting business and debating lines of morality about stolen goods, we see the middle classes working to secure their own economic futures through corrupt practices like Nathalie Armin’s grasping government official and Chook Sibtain’s ever-hungry police officer, we see the varying optimism of young girls like Anjana Vasan’s Manju, Anjli Mohindra’s Kehkashan and Anneika Rose’s highly affecting Meena as they contemplate the futures available in a society that can’t change quickly enough for them."
1755,1755,Ought To Be Clowns,17/01/2017,mag9l,Promises Promises, Southwark Playhouse,"On the face of it, you could see why reviving Promises Promises would be an appealing prospect – written by Neil Simon from a Billy Wilder film and featuring a score by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. But digging even just a little deeper – a running time of nearly 3 hours and an antiquated set of gender politics made it a tough one to watch, and an even tougher one to excuse in today’s society. If you were so inclined, you could argue that Billy Wilder and I.A.L Diamond’s original screenplay for the 1960 film The Apartment is “a triumph of 1960s sexual work-place politics” but quite what that has to say to audiences today is very unclear, (apart from gentlemen d’un certain âge craving the good old days natch). I have liked much of director Bronagh Lagan’s previous work but I can’t help pondering the choice here. The story revolves around Chuck, an ambitious New Yorker whose promotion prospects are closely aligned with the availability of his well-situated apartment as a shag-pad for his superiors to carry out their affairs and among them is his boss who just happens to be schtupping Fran, on whom Billy has a crush. But period misogyny is still misogyny and with paper-thin characterisation being the order of the day, there’s little to excuse what passes here. We’re to root for the four guys who wonder ‘Where Can You Take a Girl?’ to cheat on their wives; we’re to put up with almost all the female characters being dismissed as ciphers with barely a word to say; and in the most egregious sequence, a woman takes an overdose because a lover leaves her, but can be cheered up, essentially, by being in a musical as her next would-be lover and a doctor sing and dance her emotional devastation away (apparently)."
1756,1756,Ought To Be Clowns,28/10/2010,Ian,Palace of the End, Arcola,"Timing is everything and whether by coincidence or design, this production of Judith Thompson’s Palace of the End arrives at the smaller Studio 2 at the Arcola Theatre, right at the moment when 2 of its 3 strands about Iraq and the conflict there have resurfaced at the top of the headlines with Wikileaks uncovering the shocking scale of prisoner abuse and civilian deaths and the recent publication of the post-mortem report into David Kelly’s death. Thompson’s play pulls together three monologues, fictional in terms of the actual words but thoroughly based in reality as they are all based on real-life people: Lynndie England, the young US soldier whose grinning face whilst abusing Iraqi prisoners became an enduring image of the US intervention; David Kelly, the UN weapons inspector who broke cover to reveal that the position on Weapons of Mass Destruction had been hugely overstated, the pressure of which caused him to take his own life and Nehrjas Al-Saffrah, the wife of an Iraqi Communist politician who lived in Baghdad as Saddam Hussein’s regime took hold. In the first section, Jade Williams portrays the trailer park girl turned soldier elevated into a position of huge responsibility at the Abu Ghraib prison and patently ill-equipped to deal with it. We see her back in West Virginia, heavily pregnant, awaiting trial and seething with rage at the internet commentary on her, although she’s more offended by being considered ugly than the reaction to her conduct. Williams does well at suggesting the indoctrination of military personnel in order to allow them to devalue human life in such a way but also how suggestible they would have to be to carry out such deeds: it is a complex piece and it is testament to Williams’ performance that s one really does have to begin to question whether or not sympathy might be due to this girl. Robin Soans (continuing two connections here, he appeared in Swale’s The Rivals earlier this year and at Pieces of Vincent here at the Arcola just last month) is incandescent as David Kelly, giving possibly one of the best performances of the year. There’s a searing intensity to his performance as he paces the small space addressing us directly and forcing us to confront his dilemma with him made all the more tragic by his heart-rending simple request that starts his monologue and the quiet dignity in the acknowledgement of his complicity; reminding us of the human tragedy of a family that lost a father and husband: something all those ghoulish conspiracy theorists would do well to remember. And rounding off the evening is Imogen Smith as Nehrjas whose monologue initially offers a warm portrayal of life in Baghdad back in the 1960s with anecdotes about hundreds of varieties of dates and a genial flightiness. This provides a welcome respite before the emotional sledgehammer which is her account of the suffering inflicted upon her and her family by the Iraqi secret police who came along with the arrival of Saddam Hussein on the political scene. The themes of complicity and responsibility are made explicit here on the larger scale with the reminder that this was a regime initially supported by the USA but also in Smith’s harrowing account of the unimaginable horrors perpetrated upon her and her children as a result of their refusal to divulge information and the terrible guilt that now weighs on her shoulders. Smith does not overplay her hand here, the simply spoken words are enough to pierce the soul without any histrionics and by the time the final twist kicks you in the teeth, the numbed silence as the lights finally come up speaks volumes as to the importance of this work: it almost feels like a crime to applaud, there ought to be some other way to show appreciation (this is mine). The combined effect is devastating and though only capturing three stories over a stretch of some decades, Thompson shows remarkable subtlety in suggesting how each of her protagonists might have rationalised their actions, she is of course putting words into the mouths of real people who cannot speak for themselves but the connections are sensitively drawn with quiet echoes of motifs and the odd line of dialogue. Swale’s direction shows a strong understanding of how to work in limited spaces, cognisant of the need to keep all three actors engaging in their own ways through movement and unafraid to have them get in the faces of the audience: there were times when I wanted to look away from both Soans and Smith, but I knew that I could not. Simon Kenny’s design is simple and maintains the Arcola’s green credentials by recycling one of the tree trunks from The County. Altogether, a stunningly affecting evening that is rarely easy but vitally important and intensely compelling. Great review, this really is sensationally good. Part of me thinks it should be playing in the main house to reach a bigger audience, but then so much of its power comes from the intimacy in Studio 2. This will live with me for a long time. 'Numbed silence.' Yes, that's it exactly. Everyone seemed a little stunned at the end. With good reason – this was a really well done production: powerful writing and some superb performances. Spellbinding, absolutely brilliant. Deserves a bigger audience"
1757,1757,Ought To Be Clowns,06/10/2013,Ian,Virgin, Watford Palace Theatre,"EV Crowe’s latest play Virgin comes to us under the auspices of Watford Palace’s Ideal World season, exploring the way that the digital revolution has impacted on human relationships, but it crowbars so much into its 80 minutes that the brief ends up feeling a little constrictive. Working mother Emily toils away in local government and is determined that a project to bring high-speed broadband to her rural village will be the springboard to get her out of the admin office. But with a younger, web-savvy generation snapping at her heels, she is forced to confront the limitations of her own bandwidth. Laura Elphinstone imbues the spiky Emily with a remarkably conflicted complexity – her ambition thwarted by men, her maternal instinct disguised by stress, her warmly hesitant optimism at connecting the village tempered by her treatment of loyal husband Mark, Michael Shelford adorable in a range of chunky knits. And she is contrasted well by Rosie Wyatt as cuckoo-in-the-nest Sally, the consultant who comes to stay in their home whilst helping out on the project and the embodiment of a tech-confident but socially-awkward youth, happier online than IRL. But though the play starts off seeming as if its focus is going to be about the effect of increased communication on rural communities, it twists and turns through sexual politics in the office, gender politics in the home, issues of self-belief and understanding one’s own limits – technology becomes less and less important as the play becomes thematically cluttered and its messages confused. At times, one can see the research spilling out – statistics about the vast proportion of web content being generated by white men, the gender pay divide in local government, but they’re not woven into the fabric of the writing, lacking the import they ought to bring."

1759,1759,Ought To Be Clowns,29/04/2018,Ian,Absolute Hell, National Theatre,"We’ve all got a history, a bit of a chequered past and Rodney Ackland’s play Absolute Hell is no exception. Premiered in 1952 under the title The Pink Room, it received an enormous critical drubbing which led to a 40 year near-silence from the playwright. But as time passes, trends shift and plays eventually get rewritten, a new version of the drama emerged in the late 1980s to considerably more success. It is that version that is being revived here by Joe Hill-Gibbins with the kind of luxury casting that National Theatres are made for. And with the world of this slice-of-life play being made up of a vast ensemble of characters, it’s a great fit. Absolute Hell is set in a Soho members club in the period between the end of WWII and the Labour general election win and follows its patrons as they retreat from the social (and physical) upheaval of wartime into a fug of drink, drugs and debauchery.  And as it stretches leisurely over three hours, we skate deliciously over these ne’er-do-wells and their ne’er-do-welling. They’re led by Kate Fleetwood’s Christine is the hostess who welcomes all with a fixed smile, barely hiding the haunting loneliness she can’t quite keep at bay. And also featuring strongly is Charles Edwards’ Hugh is a writer struggling to retread past glories and to keep his relationship with long-term lover and war vet Nigel (an excellent Prasanna Puwanarajah) intact. Among many others, there’s also Sinéad Matthews’ party girl, Jonathan Slinger’s queenish movie producer, Eileen Walsh’s batty Oirish preacher, Aaron Heffernan’s inquisitive and horny GI, Stephanie Jacob’s hard-working factotum. And in the almost claustrophobic darkness of Lizzie Clachan’s set design, their trials and tribulations play out with vivid characterisation and an often-striking resonance. There’s little sense of an over-arching plot which may turn some off but Hill-Gibbins proves that it isn’t needed, the connective tissue that holds them together is the sticky floor of the club as much as anything."
1760,1760,Ought To Be Clowns,20/12/2016,mag9l,Anything Goes, Upstairs at the Gatehouse,"Last year’s Christmas musical at Highgate’s Upstairs at the Gatehouse – Legally Blonde – was a break from recent tradition which has seen them lovingly recreate classic Broadway musicals like Guys and Dolls, Crazy For You and Singin’ in the Rain in miniature. Though smaller in scale, Ovation’s productions have never been lacking in ambition and so I was most pleased indeed to see Cole Porter’s Anything Goes on the slate for this festive season. And as per usual, John Plews’ distillation of the 1934 show is a thrill from start to finish, slickly directed in its traverse staging which allows both for a practical paciness and a real fluidity of movement, especially in the cleverly constructed choreography of Chris Whittaker. With plenty of tap, a whole deal of razzmatazz and some absolute corkers of a song (‘You’re The Top’, ‘I Get A Kick Out Of You’, ‘Blow Gabriel Blow’), it’s near song and dance heaven. It’s performed by a very capable company of fresh faces, doing some impressive work. Australian Taryn Erickson sparkles in her UK theatre debut as the irrepressible Reno Sweeney, a wisecracking woman of the world whose eye is drawn to the stuffy Englishness of Sir Evelyn Oakleigh (a tremendous comic performance from Jack Keane), who happens to be engaged to English rose Hope Harcourt who in turn is in love with roguish Billy Crocker, a good friend of Reno’s. Samantha Dorsey and Jack McCann are both good as Hope and Billy, but there’s no denying that their character fade a little in the limelight next to Reno and Oakleigh, a fault of the writing as much as anything. There’s strong work too from David Pendlebury and Chloe Adele Edwards as gangster Moonface Martin and his moll Bonnie, adding to the shenanigans onboard the SS American as it traverses the Atlantic. The plot is hokum but mostly enjoyably so, but given that I have called to account other shows for the same thing, I do have to point out that this is another show with an all-white cast. And more problematically, especially in light of the furore rightfully surrounding the Print Room just now, the use of ‘Oriental’ stereotypes here is right on the knuckle. "

It will make you miss being in a theatre something crazy  As for the show itself, I remain a little conflicted by the whole affair. Did this concert really need to happen? Was there an artistic impetus behind it rather than trying to ensure the longest-running show argument still held? To hear the cast talk about the special atmosphere at every performance suggests there was something unique at work here that I missed. For me though, a semi-staged concert is still a concert (and this is the third time the show has gone for the concert style) and ultimately, I want more from my theatre, even with a show I love as much as this."

1764,1764,Ought To Be Clowns,14/07/2014,mag9l,Pacific Overtures, Union,"Many of Stephen Sondheim’s musicals instantly gain the sobriquet ‘ambitious’ and so early productions suffered short runs. But where several have been revised and reworked into modern classics, 1976’s Pacific Overtures has remained one of his least produced works, languishing in relative obscurity. Which makes it ideal fodder for the musical theatre powerhouse of the Union Theatre to take on and revive, with Michael Strassen’s production garnering massive ticket sales before the run had even begun. The show is set in mid-nineteenth century Japan where their isolationist policy has meant no visitors have been received to the country for hundreds of years. When an American ship arrives boisterously demanding an audience with the emperor and unwilling to have their colonial ambitions easily appeased, the Far Eastern nation is sucked slowly into the coils of Westernisation and opened up to ‘civilisation’. Based on John Weidman’s original play to which Sondheim added 12 melodically sophisticated songs, it isn’t too hard to see why it isn’t more often on our stages.  At a theatre already renowned for its all-male Gilbert & Sullivan productions, it is perhaps unsurprising to be confronted by another entirely male cast even if there doesn’t seem to be an over-riding concept that attempts to justify it. More tellingly, it’s an almost entirely white cast who perform in what could be considered yellow-face. To be sure, there’s a deeply respectful air to the whole production, with its butoh and kabuki influences, and Jean Gray’s costumes and make-up are used effectively, though it is hard to shake a certain sense of unease at the default mode here. And there are times when the staging with its often intricate choreography threaten to overwhelm the production, over-elaborate sequences disturbing the otherwise cool minimalism, the high camp that occasionally creeps in shifting the mood away from its contemplative intelligence. This is felt more keenly in the overlong first act where Weidman’s book takes far too long to set up and explore Japanese isolationism and Sondheim’s densely challenging score, well, challenges. Post-interval, there’s a freer sense of play as matters move more dynamically."
1765,1765,Ought To Be Clowns,22/02/2019,Ian,Only Fools and Horses The Musical, Theatre Royal Haymarket,"Full disclosure – I don’t know if I’ve ever seen an episode of Only Fools and Horses voluntarily. I mean I’ve seen clips and I’ve probably been in a room where other people were watching it, but it was never a show that has figured in my life. So news of Only Fools and Horses The Musical didn’t bring quite the excitement it did for so many others, ensuring that this was a commercial success long before any critics got near it. And as such, my own reaction can only be viewed through this lens. When people say ‘you don’t have to have seen the TV show to get the jokes’. I can tell you they’re having a laugh. This musical is suffused with injokes, from the pre-show announcements onwards and in some ways, rightly so (having had a similar kind of experience with Acorn Antiques the Musical in this very theatre). Paul Whitehouse and Jim Sullivan’s book is an exercise in fan service, stitching together many of the iconic comic sequences from the 20-odd years of the show and dressing them up with an origin story kind of plot. The people around me loved it. And it was a heartening sight to see the Theatre Royal Haymarket full of people who wouldn’t necessarily be booking to come to a musical (the last one the guys next to me had seen was Starlight Express!).  Sadly though, this is no great shakes at all as a new musical. For one, the score is peppered with 80s jukebox hits, relying on the cheery warmth of Bill Withers’ ‘Lovely Day’ to take us into the interval really feels like a cheat. And of the new songs, few stand out at all even with strong performances from the likes of Dianne Pilkington’s Raquel.  And whether you get the injokes or not, there’s no mistaking the humour’s decided reliance on a very dated mode of comedy, situating us thoroughly in the 80s. Which isn’t a bad thing in and of itself, it just feels lazy, not allowing for any sophistication to creep in, to wit the fever dream which mocks what Peckham has become today (seriously, all jokes about coffee shops need to stop now)."
1766,1766,Ought To Be Clowns,09/10/2019,Ian,Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Union Theatre,"A kiss on the hand may indeed be quite continental (see, Brexit really does get everywhere…!) but a classic musical that is just straight-up uncomplicated good fun is everyone’s best friend. Sasha Regan’s revival of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes fully embraces all its candyfloss campness but anchors it with the crucial decisions to forefront the easy musicality of Jule Styne’s fantastic score (ably assisted by MD Henry Brennan) and in casting its two female leads just right, to remind us that it isn’t actually as throwaway as all that in the end. True, the book, by Anita Loos and Joseph Fields from her original novel, is mainly frothy fun as it follows Arkansas showgirl Lorelei Lee to Paris and back with any number of wealthy suitors in her wake. But by keeping her friend and ‘chaperone’ Dorothy high in the mix, a certain brand of female solidarity shines through. And with Abigayle Honeywill and Eleanor Lakin, the show proves riotous good fun. Tackling the role made famous on film by a certain Ms Monroe, Honeywill nails the offbeat humour and charming warmth of a budding superstar. And Lakin offers up some stunningly confident vocals as her charismatic confidante – one to watch out for, mark my words.  Around them, Regan fills her stage with youthful bodies – this is a 18 strong company –  and through Zak Nemorin’s exuberant choreography in the openness of Justin Williams’ set, a real sense of freshness and life shines through. Whether Olympian stretching, upper class passengers, Parisian partygoers or fabulous follies dancers, there’s a great use of both space and physicality that is constantly fun to watch. And in key supporting roles, there’s great work from the likes of Ashlee Young as a perky dancer and Freddie King as the genial Henry. As mentioned, Styne’s score is full of evergreen classics, the iconic ‘Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend’ and ‘Bye Bye Baby’ are just two of the standouts, and the quality of the singing is strong throughout. And make sure not to be too far away towards the end of the interval to get a nice little bonus. But make no mistake, the real treats are onstage, in Nemorin’s choreography and Honeywill and Lakin’s characterful performances.   "
1767,1767,Ought To Be Clowns,27/01/2010,Ian,Daisy Pulls It Off, Arts Theatre,"I rather suspect that Daisy Pulls It Off at the Arts Theatre is an old-fashioned a tale as you’ll ever see, it is certainly the one of the most odd. It’s a jolly old hockey sticks boarding school romp with Daisy Meredith, a poor scholarship girl, having to prove herself at Grangewood School for Young Ladies in the face of some absolutely beastly bullies who just don’t like her. It helps of course that she is exceptionally intelligent, plays a mean game of hockey and writes lovely poetry. There’s some good performances here, Joanne Gale and Emma Scholes as the older girls shone for me, but some really painful ones too. There’s little real connection between the characters, such limited interactions, that it is hard to get much sense of a company here, and it is just unclear what the tone of the piece really is. Is it a spoof? Is it a comedy? Is it a straight-up play? I’m not sure, and I don’t think the actors were either, such was the variance in the way they played their roles. Plus my bete noire of the year so far raised its head again, with Daisy narrating random sections of the play which stilted the rhythm of the piece horribly. This production started life at the small Baron’s Court theatre and it betrays its roots rather badly: the bare staging is unforgivably exposed and looks far too amateur on the larger stage and there isn’t sufficient quality of performance or humour or anything else to compensate for that. Transferring it seems an odd choice as I’m really not sure who this is aimed at, adults or school parties, it’s hard to tell. And with the ticket prices they are asking (the theatre was barely a fifth full last night), it is hard to recommend it. This is one jolly jape Daisy has failed to pull off I’m afraid. Thank for sharing good and useful information.  This information is very valuable. Regards.Mountain House"
1768,1768,Ought To Be Clowns,04/03/2020,Ian,All Quiet on the Western Front, VAULT Festival,"A sensitive and intelligent choice underpins this deeply moving adaptation of Erich Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front by Incognito Theatre Company. Though the narrative follows the experience of German trench warfare, the company speak in English accents and so you can’t help but feel for all of the many millions who were killed, regardless of their nationality. The five classmates who are recruited from their schoolroom and shipped off to the frontline with just the scarcest bit of shoddy training could be from anywhere – patriotic feeling knows no borders – and the empty promises they receive sound the same in any language. Nobody was home for Christmas. What sustained them, as much as it could, was the camaraderie of their fellow soldiers.  And that is where this production excels. Roberta Zuric’s production makes powerful, pointed use of Zac Nemorin’s choreography to create a highly physical interpretation of the text, full of searching and searing imagery. As with so much of life, the everyday lays alongside the extraordinary, from sitting on the crapper to dealing with lost limbs and unimaginable PTSD, that trauma as much mental as physical."
1769,1769,Ought To Be Clowns,09/02/2016,mag9l,In the Night Time (Before the Sun Rises), Gate,"Nina Segal’s debut play In the Night Time (Before the Sun Rises) begins with a couple bursting free out of shrink-wrapped confines, plastic film their amniotic sac from which they emerge with their tales of new-born woes. The problem is their new-born though, a baby daughter who just won’t stop crying and over the duration of one long, long night, they have their certainties well and truly rocked by the realisation of exactly what they have taken on as new parents in today’s world. As Man and Woman recount the story first of how they met, then how they moved in together and soon found themselves expecting, we’re introduced to Segal’s poetic writing style of almost duelling narratives (“A woman and a man meet in a street/ A woman and a man meet in a bar”), a storytelling game to amuse their infant and whose rhetoric is designed to make connections for the audience. For the angst they’re feeling in the nursery is amplified by a sense that the horrors of the world outside are seeping in – baby’s first existential crisis. It’s a device that works well in the domestic context – the increasingly exhausted parents are first torn apart and then thrust together by their fears and frustrations, haunted and hostile through lack of sleep and Adelle Leonce and Alex Waldmann nail the insecurity that crashes unannounced into their world. Ben Kidd’s direction is tightly focused throughout – there are magical moments when it feels like Leonce is talking to you and you alone and Waldmann’s desolation becomes increasingly moving. And amidst the cramped clutter that builds up in Georgia Lowe’s cubic frame, where chaos is taking over from child-proofing and the ominous build of George Dennis’ textured sound design is eminently suggestible, Segal’s writing aims higher but doesn’t quite always reach the mark. Man and Woman’s doubts about bringing a child into this world lose their power when the threats are vaguely global, softly unspecific, it is from the personal that they recoil in appalled horror, the whispered unsayable “we shouldn’t have brought her here…” that the night is truly darkest."
1770,1770,Ought To Be Clowns,30/01/2014,Ian,The Robbers, New Diorama,"The final piece of The Faction’s 2014 Rep Season 2014 is a revival of their 2011 successful take on Schiller’s The Robbers, which slots in along Hamlet and Thebes in playing through February at the New Diorama. As Schiller’s first play, it has something of a rawness about it in the way that brings together a surprisingly mature (for the 1780s) debate about state versus revolution, intervention versus anarchy, with the kind of histrionic family drama that at times recalls Shakespeare at his most bafflingly obtuse. The play bounces between antagonistic siblings, Franz and Karl von Moor. The devilish Franz has hoodwinked their father into disinheriting the older Franz and so is allowed to grasp for power and money in court, whereas Karl flees to the forest where he becomes the head of a vicious band of robbers who are determined to start the revolution. Interestingly, the two never meet but their actions impact strongly on those around them as class, religion and society are indicted in melodramatic style. A new version by Daniel Millar and Mark Leipacher, who also directs, modernises much of the language whilst keeping a sense of the arch Romanticism of the period. And the characteristic ensemble work of The Faction is present and correct to bring an inventive gravitas to matters – an advancing troop of fighter are hissingly exciting in slow-motion, the anguish that Karl shows later on is movingly shown through repeated action. The use of chalk on the walls has a visual flair too that settles the mood.  A slow opening means it can feel a little hard to get into but it definitely felt worth the effort post-interval and by the time the finale reaches its body-strewn conclusion (be warned, there’s lots of loud gunshots), it feels a suitable companion piece to the rest of the rep season. There’s real joy in seeing a company stretching itself across different work – Cary Crankson impressed once again for me as did Christopher Hughes’ gift for nonplussed comedy, but it was gratifying to see Jeryl Burgess really shine through too in two key roles.  But for all the seriousness and emotional intensity, there’s always the hint that things might turn schlocky, a telenovela of schadenfreude threatening to break free as Andrew Chevalier’s Richard III-esque Franz amps up his dastardly quotient, Tom Radford’s handsomely furrowed brow as Karl makes one bafflingly over-complicated decision after another and a former lover becomes a pious nun despite her burning loins – I mean, Sunset Beach has nothing on this! One can’t help but wonder what The Robbers would be like with a more upfront camp aesthetic full of cliffhangers and cutaways…  "
1771,1771,Ought To Be Clowns,08/07/2011,Ian,Arcadia, LAMDA at Lyric Hammersmith,"Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia was an unexpected pleasure for me when I first saw it in the summer of 2009 at the Duke of York’s Theatre: I booked not knowing anything about it, easily seduced by the luxury casting, but was blown away by a play of unexpected intelligence and feeling, something of a rarity in the commercial West End. So when it was announced that as part of their final year showcases, LAMDA students were putting on four shows – free of charge – at the Lyric Hammersmith, one of which was Arcadia, the chance to revisit a good play and potentially spot some stars of the future could not be resisted by a [insert correct collective noun for a group of Twitter theatre nerds] of us: I’ve opted to restrict myself to a few remarks rather than an all-out review. Predictably this production came nowhere near the dizzy heights of the West End production, it was never likely to to be honest, but it did seem a curious choice as a play for showcasing as it didn’t seem like a natural fit for the talent here – too many cases of square pegs being asked to fit round holes especially in trying to portray a wide range of ages from a single cohort. Some of the actors were able to rise above their miscasting to still deliver strong performances but others fell short, unable to convince of the age they were trying to play, mainly through failing to extend their performances right down to the physicality of the characters. Likewise some of the humour of Stoppard’s writing got lost in the delivery and so this Arcadia never really caught fire, never enraptured me to the point where I forgot I was watching a student performance as I have previously done."
1772,1772,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,It’s Only Life, Union,"It’s trickier than you might think to make a revue really work. Putting together a programme of unconnected songs to showcase a composer’s work is one thing, but breathing genuine theatrical life into it is entirely another. Fortunately, the folks behind It’s Only Life, produced by Aria Entertainment at the Union Theatre, have done just that. The US composer and lyricist John Bucchino is the man of the moment here, in a show conceived by himself and Daisy Prince. But it is tempting to consider director Tania Azevedo the real star, leading a superb company of cast and creatives to elevate what could be something quite slight, into a couple of hours of something really quite moving. From the ice-cream-hued accents on Justin Williams and Jonny Rust’s design to the sprinkling of William Whelton’s choreography, to the indefatigable piano of MD Nick Barstow (seriously, not even a conversation about a lighting crisis seemed to distract him whilst playing), the world of this show is made to be warm and inviting – a place where you might not mind sharing a secret but equally, a place where you don’t have to if you don’t want."
1773,1773,Ought To Be Clowns,04/04/2019,Ian,Top Girls, National Theatre,"Written by a woman and directed by a woman, the opening night of an all-female play couldn’t have been better timed for the National Theatre. But while this doesn’t negate the concerns raised in the too-male-heavy partial season announcement from last week, it does frame them – and the questions it provokes – in a larger context. After all, Lyndsey Turner’s production of Caryl Churchill’s Top Girls is the first not to use double-casting, which means it boasts a company of 18 women – more of this please. It helps that they are performing such a bravura piece of writing. Churchill’s 1982 play is a shrewd and startling affair which has lost none of its impact here as it gives women their voices in ways which haven’t always (and in some ways still don’t) been encouraged. From historical characters (both real and imagined) to contemporary families (it may be set in the 80s but there’s nothing dated about what is happening here), we are dared to listen. Sometimes it can be a bit of a challenge. The first scene in particular is full of overlapping dialogue as centuries of repressed history spill forth but Turner has calibrated her cast so very well. The likes of Siobhán Redmond, Amanda Lawrence and Wendy Kweh know how to play with dynamics, tapping into Churchill’s rhythms which feel collaborative rather than competitive as they unfurl a tapestry of experience rarely mentioned in the history books.  And as later scenes focus in on the fiercely ambitious Marlene, the scope is no less momentous as the political intertwines with the intensely personal, the rise of the cult of the individual laid bare in all its blinkered certainty. Katherine Kingsley’s Marlene is hypnotically compelling and she is supported by excellent work by Lucy Black and Liv Hill (a hugely impressive debut) as her sister and niece who thrash out notions of ambition and sacrifice through a tangled familial lens."
1774,1774,Ought To Be Clowns,10/07/2017,Ian,Queer Theatre – Certain Young Men, National,"“Well join the radical wing of the movement where to be really queer you have, as it were, to nail your foreskin to the transgressive mast. Literally it seems, on occasion.” I have to admit to not necessarily being the greatest fan of Peter Gill’s writing and seeing a reading of one of his plays after having partaken of a little of the Pride festivities on Saturday afternoon was definitely not one of my wiser moves. But I wanted the complete set of these readings and so I sat down for 2009’s Certain Young Men. Following the lives of four gay couples and told predominantly in duologues, it had the slight sense of yet another version of La Ronde as established pairings disintegrate and new ones reform. It is more complex than that, as it seeks to present varied and various forms of gay personalities and relationships, resisting the easy definition of a gay community to present a heterogenous grouping of homosexual men with multiple and conflicting desires. Whether it was the staging with its row of empty chairs, the theatrical word games that characterises one of the key couplings (Billy Howle and Lorne MacFadyen here) which needed more than it got here, or the gin I’d consumed, the play rarely gripped me in this form. I enjoyed Jonathan Bailey and Ben Batt’s relationship angst the most and Oliver Chris and Toby Wharton sold their own troubles well but whilst this was certainly the place to see it, it wasn’t the right time for me.         "
1775,1775,Ought To Be Clowns,21/09/2014,Ian,Albion, Bush Theatre,"Chris Thompson had a big success with his first play Carthage at the Finborough Theatre which was a… WHY WHY WHY DELILAH. And now his follow-up play Albion has opened at the Bush…. SWING IT SHAKE IT MOVE IT MAKE IT WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE. It’s a bit of a challenging work as it plays with traditional structure to incorporate the fine art of karaoke as a storytelling device…HERE COMES THE HOTSTEPPER, MURDERER…(well, sometimes, and then sometimes it is just karaoke)…NAA NANANANAA NANANANAA NANANAA NANANAA NANANANAAA into its tale of how an extremist right-wing group takes root in an East End boozer. In an interview about the show, dramaturg Rob Drummer speaks of how “the rise of the far right needs to be understood now more than ever” but it is never abundantly clear how this chosen format is an appropriate or effective one to enable such understanding. As you can see from the opening paragraph, it can be a little disarming to have characters break out into song in the middle of conversations, especially when there is a tenuous link at best but more frustrating is the lack of consistency in the way in which music is used. The interpolation of ‘The Rose’ into a key scene is a genuinely moving moment and with its verses scattered through the company, ‘Seven Nation Army’ becomes a brutally effective rallying call. But more often, the songs get in the way as they break any sort of dramatic tension that the writing has developed as we’re forced to sit through gritted-teeth renditions of songs from Survivor to the Spice Girls with performances that assumedly pay lip service to the quality of your average karaoke night. And it’s a real shame as Thompson’s writing touches on a number of burning hot issues like English vs British national identity, beheadings in warzones, the rise of parties like UK*P beyond what might be considered its natural constituency, even the enduring popularity of glorified karaoke shows like The X Factor which has just returned to our screens. But these are all sacrificed for the need to shoehorn in another song."
1776,1776,Ought To Be Clowns,06/12/2010,Ian,Cart Macabre, Old Vic Tunnels,"Two years in the making, Living Structures’ immersive theatre show Cart Macabre takes over the Old Vic Tunnels for December and it is thanks to the lovely, ever-hard-working Jake at A Younger Theatre (a highly recommended site) who let me know about this show in good time to grab tickets before they quickly sold out. Mining a similar furrow to shows like You Me Bum Bum Train, it mixes the concepts of theatre and installation to create something unique, in this case, a nightmarish ghost train ride through the cavernous space under Waterloo. After emptying our pockets and being given personalised luggage labels, we’re wheeled off into the dark, one by one, on individual flat wheelbarrows by silent cast members dressed in sailors’ uniforms: it’s a slightly unnerving and highly effective beginning as we’re then guided onto carts in the pitch black as a haunting voice fill the air and splits into a multitude of harmonies. Somewhat disorientated, the four-person carts then start to move and the journey begins. We’re then taken on a voyage through a succession of theatrical vignettes, animations, performance art pieces, videos, shadow puppetry, all revealed to us through peepholes and shutters, as the carts rocket round the space in the Old Vic Tunnels, sometimes feeling like it is a train on tracks, sometimes wheeling round in circles, at one point evoking the movement of floating entirely convincingly. We become voyeur, victim, viewer, complicit yet exposed as the heavy symbolism of death, limbo and the afterlife envelops us, bodies descend from above into the carts, our belongings float pass in plastic bags, masked figures poke and prod in a twisted take on a carnival. Everything is held together through the highly affecting use of song: mournful folk melodies, redolent of the sea, echo around, with solos and beautifully harmonious choruses floating by. It was all really rather well done, the whole approach is so disorientating that one really doesn’t know what to anticipate next. The quality of the experiences varied somewhat but the level of expectation was always nerve-tingling as the unexpectedness of so much that happens never really dissipates. The cart hurtles with such force at some points that the woman next to me was clinging onto my arm for dear life, despite us having never met nor able to see each other’s face. Once it finishes, there is the opportunity to walk around the performance space with the lights on and to discover how the magic was carried out. It is nicely illuminating and in a couple of cases highly revelatory (I couldn’t believe how simply the ‘floating’ was done, given how effective it was)."
1777,1777,Ought To Be Clowns,09/10/2009,Ian,Annie Get Your Gun, Young Vic,"Running right through to January, the Young Vic has set a lot into Annie Get Your Gun, their longest running production to date. Starring Jane Horrocks as the sharp-shooting Annie Oakley, this musical contains some incredibly well-known songs, and so would seem like a fairly safe bet. First off, the look of the whole show really is quite arresting, and not in a good way. It instantly evokes ‘school show’ as it really does look cheap and shabby, and the lack of depth in the stage is highlighted every time there’s more than 4 people on stage as they are having to carefully negotiate their way around each other and the props without tumbling off. And on top of that, the design is really quite unsuited to the venue. Such a wide, shallow stage means that people sat towards either edge of the auditorium have severe difficulties in seeing the action when it moves to the other side. And the use of a cutaway above the stage means the front few rows miss the final scene (and the one shirtless moment!). Given that it is unreserved seating, it does seem quite unreasonable to expect people to fork out £30 and then have their view restricted.
For me, the production only really comes to life at certain moments, mostly when the whole company is working together. There’s some great comedy movement during the airshow and vocally, their combined talents work well, especially when some interesting harmonies creep in. It was particularly gratifying to hear ‘There’s No Business Like Showbusiness’ sung in its rightful home, and ‘Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better’ had enough humour to carry it through without seeming too clichéd. I just wish there was some room on the stage for some fun choreography. As the titular Annie, Jane Horrocks is largely good, but sometimes it felt like she was a little uneasy, not quite comfortable yet in the role. Part of this could be addressed once the show opens I guess and she settles more, but I have to admit to being disappointed by her vocal performance. It felt like some of her songs were in the wrong key for her, and so her voice lacked strength and often just didn’t deliver the requisite fireworks. It wasn’t by any means bad, just not what I was expecting. Julian Ovenden fared better as her rival Frank, he has the look and sound of a young John Barrowman (for better or for worse!), very much in the matinée idol mould. And there was sterling support from John Marquez and Liza Sadovy, whose vocal strength showed Horrocks up somewhat, as the sidekicks and I loved their duet. Once the adjustment has been made to the type of production you are witnessing, there is actually quite a lot to enjoy here. There’s some nicely observed comedy, some beautiful harmonies and a great energy about the show. It’s just hard to shake the feeling that you’re watching an Am-Dram production which just happens to have Jane Horrocks in the lead role. Oh, and try and bag a seat in the middle of the auditorium! Nobody tumbled off the stage the night we saw it but one of the chairs fell off, just missing a pianist. I suppose that's why they have four of them – in case one gets injured."
1778,1778,Ought To Be Clowns,30/12/2015,mag9l,Into The Woods, Royal Exchange,"As with Shakespeare, plenty of people have strong ideas about how Sondheim ‘should’ be done, so I’m always interested to see a director striking out a little to establish their own vision. Inspiration often comes from the local surroundings – memorably so with Into the Woods at the Open Air Theatre a few years back and intriguingly so with Matthew Xia’s production of the same show for the Royal Exchange in Manchester. Taking Sondheim and James Lapine’s conflation of well-known fairytales and their unseen epilogues and relocating it to a contemporary here and now, this enchanted forest may have lost a little of the overtly magical but gains plenty in an evocation of Mancunian community spirit. It may not have been the most precisely sung version of the show I’ve ever seen but the depth of performance here with all its colour and heart more than made up for it, rooting these characters perfectly in Xia’s landscape. ‘Agony’ has indeed been camper but Marc Elliott and Michael Peavoy’s modern-day Princes make you listen to the intricacy of the lyrical references like never before, Gillian Bevan’s Witch – a woman truly released from her curse – grows in impressive vocal stature throughout the show, and Natasha Cottriall (who in the interests of full disclosure, is my mother’s cousin’s wife’s sister’s daughter) brings real pathos as well as petulance to her Little Red Riding-hood. And at the heart of the show, there’s a beautiful account of the Baker and the Baker’s Wife from Alex Gaumond and Amy Ellen Richardson. Always the most normal of the characters with their struggles in the show, this pair heighten their everyman quality to hugely affecting effect – Gaumond’s schlub battling to come into his duties as husband and father and Richardson, as his harried partner, revelling delightfully in the attentions of a randy prince (and in those breeches, who wouldn’t?!). Rounding out the leading players, David Moorst caps off a brilliant year with a dopily charismatic take on Jack, a born comedian in his interactions with Rachel Goodwin’s Milky White puppet and strong of voice too."
1779,1779,Ought To Be Clowns,22/09/2017,Ian,35mm – A Musical Exhibition, The Other Palace Studio,
1780,1780,Ought To Be Clowns,24/06/2013,Ian,Dangerous Visions – Radio 4,,"Not having read the book, I can’t comment on the adaptation but it felt like a slickly told story, motoring through its central premise of the world going backwards, in all senses. We see this primarily through the eyes of lovers Beatrice and Kerans, the ever-excellent Hattie Morahan and James D’Arcy both in glorious vocal form, as their passion becomes increasingly primal. But also through the experiences of the people around them as Kerans is part of a scientific expedition to explore one last time before the newly watery world is abandoned. And there we see human behaviour degenerating, especially in the shape of Tim McInnerny’s pirate-like Strangman, out for selfish gain no matter the consequences. A powerfully evocative reading of the story makes this a recommended listen. I was less enamoured of Concrete Island, a take on the Robinson Crusoe story updated to a modern-day motorway where a cocky young architect finds himself marooned in a kind of no-man’s-land after he crashes his car. Its saving grace is the casting of Andrew Scott as the central character, raging vibrantly against his situation yet soon trying to ingratiate himself with the others he finds there, his quicksilver changes in mood make this a hypnotic listen even if the writing may grate a little with its insistent unlikeability for almost all its personnel. And the one play inspired by Ballard that I got round to was Michael Symmons Roberts’ The Sleeper, chosen mainly because Maxine Peake was in the cast, though this isn’t the way one should normally go about these things. The premise here is of a world where no-one sleeps any more – people work 24 hours, hotels are used for meetings and illicit sexual liaisons (nothing much changed there then!) and the mere mention of the idea of sleep sees the government coming down like a ton of bricks on the guilty party. So when Ella, a girl who can actually sleep emerges into the world, she is forced on the run, protected by a group of friends, but there is just too much interest in her to let her slip back into the shadows."
1781,1781,Ought To Be Clowns,04/01/2019,Ian,Pinter Five, Harold Pinter Theatre,"Pinter Five sees Patrick Marber, someone who could call Harold Pinter a friend and colleague, take the directorial wheel as he presents a triple-bill of The Room, Victoria Station and Family Voices, delving further into the wealth of short plays left behind by the playwright. The first half is taken up by Pinter’s first play, 1957’s The Room, a prototype for so much of what was to come as he settled into his distinctive voice. The air of menacing strangeness looming over seemingly everyday situations, visitors who disrupt and disturb, relationships that can never be quite pinned down… Here, it is Jane Horrocks’ Rose and Rupert Graves’ Bert who are under the spotlight, her chattering away nine to the dozen as she prepares a meal for her silent husband, a real sense of unease percolating through the scene as Horrocks brings a querulous energy that is always on edge around Graves’ brooding van driver.  And as a succession of visitors come to the door and flood into the chilly bedsit, the relative stability is questioned and then shattered, confusion and complication allowed to run over all we thought we knew, and precious few answers given. There’s much to recognise that is developed further in future plays but there’s still a pleasing meatiness to the denseness here. 
1982’s Victoria Station occupies much more overtly comedic ground as a minicab controller tries to pin down errant driver ‘274’ and get him to take a fare and played in boxed darkness, it certainly works in varying the tone of the programme well. Colin McFarlane is very funny as his patience is stretched ever thinner and then as things take a twist, making us believe the terror. And last up is 1980’s Family Voices, an elegiac piece originally for radio which folds together three monologues into a despairing tale of familial isolation. A son writes home to his mother about his new living situation in the city which is proving challenging. The mother, not receiving these missives, writes to a son she believes has abandoned her. A father then tries to reach out from beyond. "
1782,1782,Ought To Be Clowns,,Ian,Murder She Didn’t Write, Leicester Square Theatre,"Just a quickie for this as I wrote up Murder She Didn’t Write last month (review here) and there’s not too much more to say about them, than to reiterate if you’re not watching improv on a Sunday, you’re doing London wrong. This Sunday’s show saw us solve The Case of the Seatless Unicycle, a tragic tale of cats’ birthdays, clowns(!), and cupboards which saw the Degrees of Error crew having a whale of a time and possibly smuttier than ever! The very notion of an improvised show means it is hard to review it properly, you will never get to see the show I saw (pauvre Marcel…) and it’s likely I’ll miss the one you see when you take my advice to book after reading this. But you can rest assured that this is a talented company of comedians who have the relaxed ease of knowing they’re good at what they do and if they try just hard enough, they can make each other laugh just as much as the audience. (I do love a good corpse.)"
1783,1783,Ought To Be Clowns,12/01/2017,mag9l,Brains, TheatreN16,"One of the most impressive things about the set-up at Balham’s Theatre N16 is its commitment to nurturing new work and new companies in the face of an increasingly hostile funding climate. So the likes of Thick & Thin Theatre, a London-based company founded last year, are supported to develop and mount their work, such as their new play Brains, written and directed by Cameron Szerdy. Brains is set in an office at the pharmaceutical company MediBite Inc. in a near-future world that has been ravaged by a virus that has turned much of the population into zombies. When the discovery of a potential cure well and truly sets the pigeons among the staff there, from ball-busting CEO Ursula to disengaged intern Tina, no-one is quite prepared for the cut-throat insanity that is revealed. Billed as a play about “money, drugs and…zombies”, the piece takes in an ambitious sweep from office comedy to an exploration of the ethics (or lack thereof) of big pharma to all-out zombie apocalypse. And with such grand aspirations, it is perhaps unsurprising that there’s a mixed strike rate, the enthusiasm of this young group not quite matched by the scope of the writing here. Stretched thinly across different genres like this, the play ends up a jack of all trades. The office banter led by Aidan Parsons’ coke-snorting Harry and mainly directed at Jack Dent’s hapless Jeff has much potential (both very good performances) but loses a little something in the delivery. And the murky morality of Stephanie Overington’s Ursula again feels ripe for exploration, but is weighed down by dialogue that mistakes profanity for characterisation."
1784,1784,Ought To Be Clowns,22/07/2017,Ian,The House They Grew Up In, Minerva,"It’s always fascinating to get the opportunity to follow a playwright’s development in real time and so it has been with Deborah Bruce. From Godchild downstairs at the Hampstead (yes, a play written by a woman there!) to The Distance at the Orange Tree, later revived by Sheffield, and now to a Headlong co-production with Chichester, this is clearly a writer moving in the right direction. The House They Grew Up In is a difficult play to watch though, a drama focused on reclusive siblings Daniel and Peppy whose hermit-like existence in their South-East London home sees them surrounded by the accumulated detritus of everything they’ve ever owned. The arrival of the inquisitive boy from next door, seeking refuge from his own problems, threatens the equilibrium they’ve constructed though, exposing it to severe outside scrutiny like never before. And this is where Bruce’s writing is at its most thought-provoking, challenging society’s preconceptions of what is normal, daring us to identify the exact point at which individual freedoms could or should be curtailed by the intervention of the state. For the pair both have their difficulties – Daniel’s autistic tendencies means he can’t live alone and though she’s sacrificed much to care for him, the voices in Peppy’s head means that she’s is barely up to the challenge, if at all."
1785,1785,Ought To Be Clowns,29/08/2013,Ian,Armstrong’s War, Finborough,"In the rehab unit of St Vincent’s Hospital, 21 year old Canadian soldier Michael Armstrong is back home recovering from his war wounds after a IED blast in Afghanistan. But though his physical wounds are healing, there’s more than a hint of post traumatic stress disorder about the young man as he seems happiest hiding away under his bed and chatting with the imaginary presence of his friend and comrade Robbie. A half-forgotten decision to let a girl guide read to him to earn a Community Service merit badge rouses him out of his stupor as it turns out his particular helper wheelchair-bound Halley, is a fearsome whirlwind of good intentions and over the six weekly visits it takes her to get the award, the pair find themselves connected in ways they could never have imagined. Colleen Murphy’s new play Armstrong’s War may be having a criminally short run at the Finborough before its official premiere in Canada later this year, but this production touched me like hardly any other play I’ve seen recently and left me confident it is one of the better pieces of theatre I have seen all year. The way in which this unlikely pair develop such an intense relationship is extraordinarily done over 90 short minutes, the depth of the emotion it provokes is devastatingly honest and true, the performances under Jennifer Bakst’s direction unflinchingly raw and exposed, all combining to create the kind of theatre that lingers long in the mind. Their first meeting is predictably disastrous: he’d forgotten he’d signed up for it, she comes armed with a piece of teen fiction to read, but once they settle on a mutually agreeable book – (Civil) War story The Red Badge of Courage – for future sessions, the scene is set for their powerful journey together. For Michael responds viscerally to the novel as it allows him to begin to process his own unimaginable grief through writing his own story based on his experience. And Halley responds by writing her own, critiquing Michael’s account but also unlocking key aspects of her own trauma, the accident that left her disabled. Murphy cleverly manages to make each of the six sessions feel significantly different, advancing the story in intricate, nuanced ways which resonate with deep truth. She explores not only the power of reading, and the different ways in which it affects people but also the nature of storytelling and how people use fiction as a key way of dealing with grief. The way this pair tell and retell their stories is devastating, reflecting the way they see life now yet also increasingly conscious of its impact on their audience, each other.  Fittingly for the story, Jessica Barden and Mark Quartley deliver such intensely drawn performances, it sometimes felt like an invasion of something private. Barden sparkles with teenage precocity, full of the bookish confidence of the cleverest girl in the class yet touchingly concerned with the life-and-death twists and turns of her relationship with her best friend as all 12 year olds are. But despite her poise, she’s still a young girl and the raw emotion as she deals with Michael’s outpourings and then her own subsequent revelations is etched across her face in stunningly convincing detail. And Quartley balances the shell-shocked vulnerability with his fragile determination to deal with his lot to create a fully-rounded and highly affecting characterisation."
1786,1786,Ought To Be Clowns,06/04/2011,Ian,Bed and Sofa, Finborough,"The second main show in the In Their Place season at the Finborough is the European premiere of Bed and Sofa, a silent movie musical. Based on the 1926 Russian film comedy by Abram Room where a housing crisis in Moscow leads Kolya to invite newly arrived Volodya, an old war comrade, to stay with him and his wife Ludmilla in their small apartment. But Ludmilla’s head is turned by the new arrival and as she decides which, if either, of the men she prefers, the sleeping arrangements i.e. who will take the bed with her and who will take the sofa take surprising turns. Kaisa Hammarlund’s beautifully expressive Ludmilla was a joy to listen to and watch and Matilda alumnus Alastair Parker’s sexy bearish Kolya with his sometime booming baritone was nicely contrasted with Alastair Brookshaw’s sweeter Volodya as the old comrades competing for her heart. Adopting much of the style of movement of silent films kept things genial and light-hearted and produces the occasional piece of pure magic, the scene in the cinema was both totally convincing and beautifully played. But there was also a sense that this was perhaps a one-joke piece extended just a little too long. The lack of variation meant there was little genuine emotional involvement in the story, even as the story takes a darker turn. This was something not assisted by Klavan’s libretto which really is a one-trick pony of repetition, the humour of which soon wears thin. Pen’s music fitfully rises to the challenge, one densely counterpointed trio reaching Sondheim-ish heights of frustrated dreams, but too often the energy just isn’t there to pull us through the mundaneness of much of the material. David Woodhead’s design is niftily done, creating the cramped apartment effectively complete with calendar of Stalin and situating the four person band on top of it. Led by Candida Caldicot from the keys, she and the other string players did extremely well in what must become rather a rather hot cramped space. The rather random addition of Penelope Keith voicing mocking interludes, puncturing much of the Stalinist ideology of the time is an excellent touch, injecting much needed laughter and a wry humour that made this an interesting, if a little wearing, evening. We found this painful and made a quick escape. The one joke isn't funny to start with and tested our patience from the outset. Grim."
1787,1787,Ought To Be Clowns,15/08/2016,mag9l,Groundhog Day, Old Vic,"Expectations were high, how could they not be. Following on from the extraordinary success of Matilda, Tim Minchin’s next foray into musical theatre was to an adaptation of the 90s movie Groundhog Day, playing a two month run at the Old Vic ahead of a presumed Broadway transfer (a move that has had a little doubt cast on it by the withdrawal of major producer Scott Rudin). Now full disclosure, I saw it in its first week thanks to the PWC £10 tickets and the show went for a full month of previews before officially opening, so feel free to take my opinion with a pinch of salt."
1788,1788,Ought To Be Clowns,15/10/2014,Ian,The Infidel, Theatre Royal Stratford East,"With songs about fatwas, foreskins and fundamentalism amongst many others, it is clear that this musical adaptation of 2010 film The Infidel has no truck with the easily offended and rightly so. Initially one may be a little disarmed by the frankness with which the opening number makes the simple but telling point that Muslims are real people too but the warm encouragement to laugh along with them soon becomes irresistible as the wickedly observed sense of humour in David Baddiel’s book and lyrics overcomes any lingering reservations. It helps that lead character Mahmud Nasir is so wonderfully, whole-heartedly appealing in a cracking performance from Kev Orkian as a typical everyman cab driver who swears, enjoys a beer and yeah, happens to be Muslim. This relaxed, modern approach to Islam extends to his family – Mina Anwar’s fantastic Saamiya and newly-engaged son Rashid, the highly likeable Gary Wood – but Mahmud is thrown a curveball when going through the effects of his deceased mother, he discovers adoption papers that indicate he was actually born Solly Shimshillewitz to Jewish parents. What follows is a journey of discovery as Mahmud questions what this means for him and his identity, has something fundamental changed within him? Naturally he doesn’t share the news with his family but rather finds an unlikely ally in Jewish cabbie Lenny who becomes his sensei in learning all about Judaism, Orkian’s developing buddy relationship with the excellent Andrew Paul here is a thing of wonder, the essence of the play boiled down to two guys working out their differences and similarities and making each other laugh in the process. The challenges don’t end there though as Mahmud discovers his birth father is still alive but about to die in an old people’s home protected by a rabbi who won’t let him through the door until he’s proved he’s enough of a Jew. And his son’s fiancée’s mother’s fiancé just happens to be a radicalised Islamic preacher who will only accept true believers into his family. And here Baddiel is able to let loose on the polarised intolerance of sections of both communities, all communities really, as Mahmud battles through North London bar mitzvahs and East London religious rallies in a bid to find himself. Crucially, the show never takes itself too seriously – has anyone else seen gangsta rap in a niqab recently?! – and the fun that it does make of its targets is always affectionate – Alex Andreou’s impressively bearded imam calls for a “fatty-fatty-fatwa” in one of the evening’s catchier numbers. And Erran Baron Cohen’s score is undoubtedly better on the comic side of things – the benefits of wearing a burka, the unfortunate names that some people are given – the calls for deeper emotion don’t quite have the same resonance but nor do they really need to, the next big laugh is almost always mere moments away, often coming from Melanie Marshall’s brilliant multi-roling."
1789,1789,Ought To Be Clowns,19/12/2012,Ian,Honk!, Tabard,"“Did you leave him in the egg too long?” Two years ago, the Tabard Theatre revived Stiles and Drewe’s Just So for their festive show and it is to these composers that they return in 2012 with this production of Honk! A musical adaptation of the classic Hans Christian Andersen fairytale The Ugly Duckling, it follows the fortunes of a duckling, cruelly nicknamed Ugly by all around him save his mother, who looks different to the other ducks in the yard. When he ends up lost, frightened and alone, he is forced to make a personal odyssey but even as he is constantly threatened by a voracious cat and scary big humans, he also finds that there’s a big wide world outside of the barnyard where others are not quite so quick to judge. The score is one of Stiles and Drewe’s most accomplished and lyrically, it has a deceptive simplicity which allows for layers of interpretation making it an ideal family show. Joe Sterling’s nerdish Ugly goes on a powerful journey of self-discovery – characterised by moving renditions of songs like ‘Different’ and ‘Lost’ – even before his revelatory transformation; Kathryn Rutherford’s compassionate Ida is a beautiful study in maternal determination; and even in the unlikely pairing of a cat and a chicken as flatmates, there’s a lovely message of tolerance, especially when it is performed with such show-stealing verve as by Kate Scott and Lydia Grant. These performances work because they focus so strongly on character, but making it truly children-friendly, the story also works on a straight farmyard fable level. And here, Madeleine Loftin’s production stumbles a little as she has her actors occasionally dipping into animal mannerisms and without fully committing to this behavioural style throughout the whole show, it comes across as clunky and unnecessary and ultimately rather awkward. Other elements felt slightly off too: Mark White is good as the military commander leader of the geese but feels miscast against Rutherford as Ugly’s father Drake; the sound levels frequently veered to the oppressively loud which obscured much of the lyrical clarity from the ensemble members; and Christopher Hone’s set design doesn’t always quite feel robust enough to cope with the amount of clambering it has to put up with."

1791,1791,Ought To Be Clowns,09/10/2017,Ian,In Event of Moone Disaster, Theatre503,"There’s something rather delicious about the winner of the Theatre503’s International Playwriting Award hailing from Sunderland but a Mackem Andrew Thompson is, and what a winner In Event of Moone Disaster proves to be. The title derives from the interesting tidbit that speechwriters at the time had to prepare for the Moon landing going wrong and though the play uses space travel as a springboard to examine three generations of a family whose destiny seems somehow tied up there in the stars. So we encounter Sylvia on the night of the Moon landing, in awe of the possibilities it heralds; we meet Neil and Julie in the present day trying to conceive; and in 2055, Sylvia’s granddaughter is preparing to become the first person to walk on Mars. And as we see how past actions influence future possibilities, a more pressing journey of gender equality emerges as the main theme in this feminist sci-fi epic (with heart). What does the freedom to ‘have it all’ actually look like, has what we’re willing to sacrifice changed over the years, have we even progressed but at all?  The show’s most affecting moments come when the boundaries between times are at their thinnest, when life is happening in past and present at the same time. The adult Neil talking to his long-lost father, whilst his mum simultaneously spins tales to his childhood self about why he’s not in their lives; a stroke-ridden older Sylvia unable (or unwilling) to respond to visitors, instead reliving a saucy little tryst from her youth. Lisa Spirling directs with such elegance and fluidity, and a complete lack of fuss that you can’t help but buy into the rupturing of the space/time continuum."
1792,1792,Ought To Be Clowns,11/06/2015,mag9l,The Two Noble Kinsmen, White Bear,"Shakespeare completists should rejoice as Instant Classics are mounting the first major production of The Two Noble Kinsmen in London for over 15 years. Missing from the First Folio and co-credited to the Bard and John Fletcher, it often finds itself omitted from cycles such as the Globe’s Globe to Globe season back in 2012 but Wikipedia assures me it is kosher and given the chronology, it is more than likely that this tragicomedy was indeed Shakespeare’s final work.  It is often the case that lesser-performed works by playwrights collect dust for a reason and in the case of The Two Noble Kinsmen, it isn’t too hard to see why. Director David Cottis has trimmed it down to a sleek couple of hours and plays it in non-specific modern dress but it remains at its heart something of an oddity, an issue that this production can’t really address, even as it identifies a rich seam of bawdy humour and a brutal sense of sexual frustration. Theban soldiers Palamon and Arcite are being held as prisoners of war by Theseus, Duke of Athens, but their close cousinly friendship is torn apart when they both fall for the Duke’s sister-in-law Emilia, a rivalry that is only intensified as they wangle their way separately out of jail and end up competing to the death for her hand. What larks. And as it is Jacobean Shakespeare, there’s a comedy doctor, a girl driven mad by love, a hapless wooer and various prayers offered up to the gods. Cottis’ decision to stage things simply in Zoe Hammond’s abstract design works well in the space of the White Bear and in Richard Blackman’s earthy Palamon and Cavan Clarke’s erudite Arcite, has a fine pair of leads who sketch out the complex closeness of these two men. A real flourish comes in the ambitious fight work by David Broughton Davies which amplifies their physicality but it is asking too much for them to convince that they’d abandon all for Roanna Lewis’ Emilia, no matter how luminous. And in one of the more bizarrely constructed sub-plots you’ll see, the daughter of the jailer falls madly in love with Palamon but is abandoned once she helps him escape and her madness thus becomes real. So far so Ophelia, but the vast majority of her scenes are conducted as monologues – Amy Tobias acquitting herself beautifully with personality and punch – which throws the structure off-kilter, even more so when she’s finally included in scenes with other people. These other people are all played by three multi-roling actors – an economical choice to be sure but one which also challenged, especially since the plot was entirely new to me. Lanna Joffrey delineates her characters well, the quirky doctor and a deeply compassionate Hippolyta (Theseus’ wife of course…) both strong, and Robert Harding is lovely as the man who would woo the jailer’s daughter (for that is the character’s name…) despite her affliction. Simon Mitelman could perhaps afford to make the jailer and Theseus a little more distinct but he remains extremely well spoken throughout."

1794,1794,Ought To Be Clowns,14/11/2014,Ian,Girls Like That, Unicorn,"The encroachment of social media and cyber-bullying into the classrooms and lives of young’uns today is proving to be fertile ground for writers as Evan Placey’s Girls Like That follows on from Kathy Rucker’s Crystal Springs in the late summer in exploring the ramifications of lawless behaviour in this uncharted territory. Placey’s play centres heavily in St Helen’s School, where the girls have known each other since the earliest days of primary, but such ties prove easily sundered when naked pictures start to be passed around digitally. The boy gets away with it, he’s a real hottie and a stud in the making. But Scarlett isn’t so lucky, the girls she thought were her friends slut-shame her mercilessly, calling her a whore and worse, and relish the opportunity to make her life a misery. A company of six young women capture brilliantly the fierce energy of social groupings like these, the speed with which teasing becomes taunting, and the shifting power dynamics that exist within. This Friday morning performance was full of school parties and I wonder how much of it resonated with their own experiences…"
1795,1795,Ought To Be Clowns,01/08/2011,Ian,Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered, Jermyn Street,"Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered is a musical revue, celebrating of the works of Rodgers + Hart, both those lesser known and more famous, in a similar way to how Classic Moments Hidden Treasures went through the Sondheim back catalogue last year. Eschewing any kind of formal narrative, it simply flows from song to song, some obviously paired up, some just left simply alone, as the cast of five in their louche 30s Hollywood costumes swirl elegantly around the intimate stage of the Jermyn Street Theatre. In many respects, this was exactly how I imagined it would be: fairly traditional arrangements of a fairly traditional repertoire, sung professionally yet not quite reaching levels of inspiration that might make it a must-see, though it is charming. Stephen Ashfield brings an effortless class to all of his numbers, making his forthcoming entry into Legally Blonde seem an intriguing prospect; Katie Kerr injects some much needed personality into some of the quirkier numbers and Valerie Cutko’s beautifully subtle tone added an interesting texture. Running the songs together this way is fine but rarely catches fire, especially as their brevity means there’s often a lot of shuffling on and off the stage. Ashfield and Cutko managed a great chemistry in a neat pairing of songs that hinted at a deeper story, something that could have been developed further. Laura Armstrong’s strong voice fit well to the material but director Tim McArthur’s inclusion of himself as a performer, even nabbing a couple of peaches from the repertoire, didn’t really match up to the rest of the ensemble, not quite enough subtlety in his performances for my liking."
1796,1796,Ought To Be Clowns,12/02/2017,mag9l,Anyone Can Whistle, Union Theatre,"The ever-modest Sondheim considers Anyone Can Whistle ‘a laudable attempt to present something off-centre in mainstream musical theatre’, whilst trying to contextualise his first ever commercial failure. But be that as it may, it remains one of his lesser performed works for a reason (it was seen most recently in London directed by Tom Littler at the Jermyn Street in 2010 I think) as Arthur Laurents’ book strains so hard to be zany that it hasn’t noticed how fatally confused it is.  Corrupt Mayor Cora Hooper Hoover and her cronies plot to save their town from going bankrupt by faking a miracle, which attracts tourists aplenty and a bus load of patients from the local asylum who soon escape and mingle into an indistinguishable crowd. Then a fake psychiatrist turns up, who falls in love with a fake miracle verifier from Lourdes…concentrate too hard on this lot and you’ll end up in the asylum with them. Director Phil Willmott thus wisely focuses on the manifold strengths that his production brings to the table.  Holly Hughes’ choreography plays cleverly with the space to produce dynamic routines and frantic energy from a fiercely committed company (particular standouts for me were Tom Mussell, Kate Hurley and Alessandro Lubrano). Richard Baker’s musical direction is really unafraid to take Sondheim’s score head on and embrace all its variety, from full-on driving company numbers with extended recitative sections to the quiet piano melody of plaintively affecting duets.  Leading performances shine dazzlingly. Felicity Hooper’s machiavellian mayor, a woman always heard before she’s seen, is wonderfully seductive as she schemes to hold on to the power she craves. Rachel Delooze’s Nurse Apple is fascinatingly complex as she explores the complexity of her own psyche whilst trying to save the patients from her asylum. And Oliver Stanley’s Hapgood is just inspired, a man whose own manipulations are no less profound for seeming more benevolent – the power of groupthink and oratory has rarely felt so relevant  And it helps of course to have songs of this quality to work with, even when the book stinks, and you can’t deny the power of the interpretations here. Delooze’s rendition of the title track is full of gorgeous hushed fragility but at the same time, she shows us Apple is still willing to pull a fast one to get her own way. Hooper’s ‘Parade in Town’ is full of wonderfully confrontational bruised ego. And for my money, the show’s highlight comes with ‘With So Little To Be Sure Of’, a duet stripped back here to pure emotion, tender and warm and true and Delooze and Stanley get it just right."
1797,1797,Ought To Be Clowns,13/05/2014,mag9l,Just Another Love Story, London Theatre Workshop,"Sondheim revues can feel two a penny – Putting It Together played the St James just a couple of months ago – but Ray Rackham’s Just Another Love Story has a real ace up its sleeve in the return of 2010’s Best Actor in a Musical fosterIAN award winner Sam Harrison to a London stage. His turn in Salad Days was an absolute treasure and being able to hear him sing again was something I couldn’t resist, so I made my way over to Fulham to the London Theatre Workshop above the Eel Brook pub. The show is a real labour of love for Rackham, having evolved over several incarnations in the past couple of years and now including over 40 Sondheim songs from the widest range of his back catalogue, delving into rarities just as often as his more popular shows. They’ve been carefully stitched together into a free-flowing musical tapestry which includes solos, duets, medleys and even a bit of choreography to bring the music to life, celebrating the music of Stephen Sondheim by creating their own love story from his work.  It was a real pleasure to hear Harrison again and he didn’t disappoint, especially in a first half that featured him heavily. A beautifully light version of West Side Story’s ‘Something’s Coming’ set the tone of aspirational love, snippets of ‘Johanna’ and ‘Pretty Women’ from Sweeney Todd continued the theme, and teaming up with Marcia Brown for Assassins‘ ‘Unworthy of Your Love’ was an inspired choice (even if it always a little odd to hear it sung as a straight love song given its provenance). But this is far from a one man show, a company of eight share the load equally and all provide wonderful moments. Anton Tweedale’s bitterly hushed ‘Losing My Mind’ is a triumph, Lowri-Ann Davies impresses hugely in giving her own stamp to the verbal dexterity of both ‘The Boy From…’ and ‘Getting Married Today’, and Steven Brown and Ellen Verenieks’ more experienced take on love in ‘We’re Gonna Be Alright’ offers a more pragmatic note to proceedings."
1798,1798,Ought To Be Clowns,26/05/2010,Ian,The Man, Finborough,"Isn’t it great when sometimes you have your low expectations just thoroughly confounded. Having booked my ticket to see The Man at the Finborough Theatre for this particular date to ensure I could see the reading of Mike Bartlett’s new play Bull later on the same evening, I was quite disappointed when the cast was announced, the lead role being shared by four actors including Samuel Barnett but on my night, we were being landed with the playwright James Graham instead. So off I trotted to Earls Court fully prepared with grumpy indignation, but I am pleased to say that I think we just might have witnessed something very special indeed. As you enter the small auditorium, you are handed a receipt and told to keep hold of it as it will form part of the story. The set is simply dressed with piles of receipts, magazines, an iPod and speakers as the focus is on the receipts we have in our hand. Ben arrives on the pretext of trying and failing to complete his tax self-assessment form and begins to go through the pieces of paper one by one, taking them from us and deciding whether they are claimable expenses or not, telling the stories that lie behind them whilst doing so. It means that each night, the whole story will be told in a different way in a different order, providing a “uniquely interactive experience” which for once is exactly what it says. Through supermarket receipts, travelcards, invoices, dinner bills, iTunes payments, Ben tells us the tale of the last financial year with its highs and lows, but soon the detail and colour provided in the stories give us the larger picture of Ben’s life and all its considerable difficulties. I want to avoid being spoilerific about any of the revelations as most of the joy will be in discovering the story in the order that you get it on the night you go, but I will just say I doubt you’ll be able to listen to the song ‘Ben’ by Michael Jackson with a dry eye the next time you hear it. T he iTunes receipts actually work really well as a way of breaking up the delivery, but also served as a huge emotional trigger, on my night James Graham managed to get a tear rolling down my cheek within 10 minutes from his reaction to a song starting up. He was utterly convincing as the shy, apologetic Ben, unsure if he’s living the London life he ought to be, generally lacking in confidence and emotional maturity but all kinds of adorable with it. The role is being shared by Samuel Barnett, Leander Deeny, Alex Price and George Rainsford throughout its run, but I feel really quite lucky to have seen Graham performing his own work, his obvious deep connection to the material heightened the emotion of the moment quite considerably and I am sure I am not the only one who left ever so slightly in love with him. There are a few moments when the format doesn’t quite allow for the full breadth of the story to be told and consequently a little bit of dramatic license was required when the necessary receipt did not appear from an audience member, but this added to the charm of the evening, the almost ramshackle way in which this tale was being lovingly stitched together and actually felt more truthful this way, memories rarely come back to us in complete running order and telling one story can trigger the echoes of another, something Graham played extremely well. Scattered throughout the reminiscences are the only interactions that Ben has with the outside world over the telephone with a woman from the Inland Revenue in Wrexham. The role, or more accurately voice, of Lisa was played by Lizzy Watts but it is shared with Michelle Luther and Stephanie Thomas throughout the run, further adding to the possible permutations. Watts did extremely well at the endlessly patient Lisa, guiding Ben through the paperwork and responding amusingly to his increasingly more personal questions. So from entering the theatre with a slightly heavy heart, I left feeling thoroughly exhilarated and really quite moved. This was a truly thrilling night at the theatre, fresh and exciting, heartbreaking and funny, but above all genuinely engaging. Samuel Barnett is bound to be amazing as Ben, but to be honest, if you can get tickets to one of the random nights that James Graham is performing then do it, you will not regret it. Did you see Alex Price has mysteriously disappeared from the schedule?!"
1799,1799,Ought To Be Clowns,24/05/2015,mag9l,The Hudsucker Proxy, Nuffield,"It’s not been the easiest of births for The Hudsucker Proxy – an incident in the dress rehearsal left two actors hospitalised, fortunately both have now been discharged and are recuperating at home, and the decision was made to forge ahead with the show, recasting where necessary. The show is certainly an interesting prospect – a co-production between Nuffield and Liverpool Everyman & Playhouse in association with Complicite, and the first ever theatrical adaptation of a Coen Brothers film too – and its doors are now finally open in Southampton, ahead of a trip to Liverpool and then an international tour in the near future. And you can see it succeeding. The show uncovers realms of theatrical influences in the Coen Brothers’ work but also adds in much of its own, to create a dizzying screwball comedy that is frequently laugh-out-loud funny. It would be churlish to give too much away but there are some inspired moments of staging in Simon Dormandy and Toby Sedgwick’s staging, especially concerning the window of the 44th floor office in which much of the drama is set. The physical work here is explicit too, the company relying on their own bodies as much as Dick Bird’s magnificent art deco-inflected set design to create constantly imaginative sequences. Given the disruption to the schedules, one can perhaps forgive the overall feel of the production not quite flowing as efficiently as it could, the screwball twists need to turn a little tighter to keep the overarching pacing ticking over at a decent lick. But there’s nothing wrong with the performances. Joseph Timms has huge fresh-faced appeal as Norville Barnes, the unassuming mailroom guy suddenly made president of Hudsucker Industries by the manipulative board of directors, the ever-excellent Sinéad Matthews is on fine form as the journalist determined to expose him but uncovering her feelings instead, and Tamzin Griffin brilliantly delineates a series of grotesque cameos with huge relish. Musicality comes from the versatile Rob Castell, a contrasting youthful energy to Norville comes from Tim Lewis as the hopeful lift attendant and the other replacement, Dormandy himself, has much fun as the avaricious embodiment of corporate America. With hula hoops flying around (and literally off the stage at one point), angels intervening and time itself being stopped, there’s a delightful sense of playfulness to The Hudsucker Proxy that should see it go far. "
