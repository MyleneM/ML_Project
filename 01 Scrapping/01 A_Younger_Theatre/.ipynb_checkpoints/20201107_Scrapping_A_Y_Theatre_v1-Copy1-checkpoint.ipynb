       "'The Prince of Egypt has become a much beloved classic, and this adaptation is years in the making. After finding critical acclaim onscreen and nabbing itself an Oscar at the original film’s release in 1998, the biblical tale finally lands on the West End. Composer Stephen Schwartz, of the Wicked fame, has introduced 10 new songs to this musical array, adding more fuel to this already beast of a fire (there is also literal fire at one point in the production). While an incredibly talented and diverse cast take the stage, they do the best with the tools they have been given.The staging is visually spectacular, projections covering the walls of the Dominion transport the audience to a quasi-modern ancient Egypt. The stage itself is left open, with a moving block provided to lift Moses into the heavens; there is plenty space to dance and with choreographer Sean Cheesman’s ambitious routines they do just that. There is even ample opportunity to rid those pesky Egyptian’s into the hells below.Physical theatre is heavily relied upon; dancers are waves, chariots, sand dunes and mighty marble columns. The insisted reliance on movement to create ambience, while beautifully choreographed, becomes part of why this adaptation feels so underwhelming. With such an awe-inspiring set you’d think they could afford more ambitious props than people. While a majestic use of dance, for such an ambitious musical I was left wanting more at an attempt to create environment.Luke Brady’s kindly Moses finds himself a sweet and noble messenger for God while Liam Tamne’s Ramses is given a rather shocking, and in my opinion ill-advised, redemption arc. From screen to stage we see a whole array of characters fleshed out, comedic effect is applied throughout the cast and The Prince of Egypt attempts to find the funny in the Pharaoh. While Ramses is now a slightly pathetic but still disappointing first son, Pharaoh is no longer a larger than life, soon-to-be God, but a stern father disappointed in his lineage.While the stand-out songs still stand out, ‘Through Heaven’s Eyes’ is received by extended and deserved applause (what they do well they do magnificently), the new numbers are lost in the noise. Brady finds himself in the second half: he is not to be underestimated as a strong soloist. Classic songs remain classics and new numbers scratch a deep, but uncovered surface. Nevertheless, the multiple medleys of old and new numbers are carried with strength by both the chorus and the main actors.While newcomers will know no different, I fear fans of the film will be left wanting to return to the animation. While I wish to be able to appreciate the adaptation for what it is- a twist on a classic- much is lacking when compared to its superior form. In this adaption, biblical morals become a biblical bromance as Ramses and Moses seek to find religious resolution.The Prince of Egypt is playing at The Dominion Theatre until the 12th September 2020.

       "'The Prince of Egypt has become a much beloved classic, and this adaptation is years in the making. After finding critical acclaim onscreen and nabbing itself an Oscar at the original film’s release in 1998, the biblical tale finally lands on the West End. Composer Stephen Schwartz, of the Wicked fame, has introduced 10 new songs to this musical array, adding more fuel to this already beast of a fire (there is also literal fire at one point in the production). While an incredibly talented and diverse cast take the stage, they do the best with the tools they have been given.The staging is visually spectacular, projections covering the walls of the Dominion transport the audience to a quasi-modern ancient Egypt. The stage itself is left open, with a moving block provided to lift Moses into the heavens; there is plenty space to dance and with choreographer Sean Cheesman’s ambitious routines they do just that. There is even ample opportunity to rid those pesky Egyptian’s into the hells below.Physical theatre is heavily relied upon; dancers are waves, chariots, sand dunes and mighty marble columns. The insisted reliance on movement to create ambience, while beautifully choreographed, becomes part of why this adaptation feels so underwhelming. With such an awe-inspiring set you’d think they could afford more ambitious props than people. While a majestic use of dance, for such an ambitious musical I was left wanting more at an attempt to create environment.Luke Brady’s kindly Moses finds himself a sweet and noble messenger for God while Liam Tamne’s Ramses is given a rather shocking, and in my opinion ill-advised, redemption arc. From screen to stage we see a whole array of characters fleshed out, comedic effect is applied throughout the cast and The Prince of Egypt attempts to find the funny in the Pharaoh. While Ramses is now a slightly pathetic but still disappointing first son, Pharaoh is no longer a larger than life, soon-to-be God, but a stern father disappointed in his lineage.While the stand-out songs still stand out, ‘Through Heaven’s Eyes’ is received by extended and deserved applause (what they do well they do magnificently), the new numbers are lost in the noise. Brady finds himself in the second half: he is not to be underestimated as a strong soloist. Classic songs remain classics and new numbers scratch a deep, but uncovered surface. Nevertheless, the multiple medleys of old and new numbers are carried with strength by both the chorus and the main actors.While newcomers will know no different, I fear fans of the film will be left wanting to return to the animation. While I wish to be able to appreciate the adaptation for what it is- a twist on a classic- much is lacking when compared to its superior form. In this adaption, biblical morals become a biblical bromance as Ramses and Moses seek to find religious resolution.The Prince of Egypt is playing at The Dominion Theatre until the 12th September 2020.

    "                      'Review':'Mark Haddon’s “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” was published in 2003. It was the winner of more than seventeen literary awards and has now been adapted by Simon Stephens for the production that opened at the Apollo theatre in March 2013 after a successful stint at the Cottesloe with the National Theatre. It received much critical acclaim and won seven Olivier Awards including Best New Play. It has now transferred to the Gielgud Theatre where it re-opened on Monday 7th July 2014.The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time follows the story of 15 year old Christopher Boone who suffers from Aspergers Syndrome, and Autism. After his next door neighbour’s dog, Wellington, is killed with a garden fork, Christopher sets it upon himself to be a detective who must be “very very brave” and find out who the murderer is. As his journey takes off, we see his life at his “special school” where the kids are “stupid, although I’m not supposed to say that” (says Christopher). Despite his illnesses, Christopher is a superb mathematician and has set it upon himself to be the first 15 year old at his school to sit a Maths A-Level exam.  We also learn about his family life, and his career aspirations for the future as we follow his journey from 12:07am on the night of the dog’s murder…Both my parents have read Mark Haddon’s novel, so I had heard much about it, but made a conscious decision not to read it before I saw the play because I knew I would spend more time worrying about it as an adaptation rather than for the play it actually was. I went in completely blind, but from the moment I took my seat, I was hooked. Created by Academy Award nominated designer Bunny Christie, the set initially appeared to be deep set stage set out like a giant cubed grid – all in black and white. Once the play started, it was clear everything was not as simplistic as it originally seemed. I felt like the cube was a representation of the inside of Christopher’s mind and I was trapped in this giant, confused and chaotic state with him for the duration.The floor is a giant chalkboard, and at each cross point of the stage; on the floor, the walls and the ceiling, there was a hidden LED light which provided so much visual spectacle for the show, I was blown away. Lighting designer, Paule Constable has previously won 4 Olivier Awards and a Tony, amongst others, and she represented herself with stunning visuals which carried the entire production. It was so intelligent and original, I just loved it.With such a remarkable set and stunning lighting, the actors could easily have been lost amidst such a spectacle, but they weren’t. Simply put, Graham Butler is nothing short of phenomenal. He was totally convincing as “Christopher Boone”, performing his role with sensitivity and true expertise. It was a master-class in playing a “handicapped” role without being distasteful. Mr Butler was astounding and is the heart, body and soul of this production. His physicality was exceptional and his voice was used in such a remarkable way, much to the acclaim of voice coach Barbara Houseman and dialect coach Jeannette Nelson. His performance was heart-warming, engrossing and sympathetic all at the same time. He was just totally fabulous.As Christopher’s father, “Ed”, Nicolas Tennant was also superb. His shining moments were as the “endearing and sensitive” father as opposed to the “angry and vengeful” man he can sometimes be. I personally felt his emotional journey was as great as Christopher’s and despite all his flaws, I was rooting for him to be happy and to be the father that Christopher needed.From the ensemble, Sam Bond was excellent across multiple roles. He provided some much needed comedic relief towards the end of Act One, and won some of the biggest laughs of the night. Similarly, Vivienne Acheampong shone in her roles, and won the crowd over as a Caribbean “Information Guide” on the London Underground. It would also be unfair not to mention Battenberg the rat as “Toby”. He’s a real star in the making! The ensemble as a whole provided excellent figures for interpretive movements on the stage that reminded me of a kooky drama class exercise, but it wasn’t tacky or laughable – it worked. The interpretation was so cleverly directed by Marianne Elliott, the result was an accomplished and exceptional production, for which she should be recognised.Overall, this play is totally original and unlike anything else I have ever seen. The lighting and set design were the highlights for me because of their originality, but that is in no way a discredit to Graham Butler who was utterly magnificent. I could quote my favourite moments all day, but we would be here…all day. The script is magnificent and the actors provide such heart to the words, you need to see it from them, rather than read it from me.I cannot implore you enough to go and see this remarkable piece of theatre. My audience was utterly captivated throughout the duration; I heard laughter, and gasps of shock and “awwws” many many times, but never any whispers of confusion or talking during some of the long silences on stage. I cried near the end because of how much love there is in this production. It might be a total cliché but it was the heart of this play that brought me, and several others around me, to tears. It was exhausting on my eyes, loud in my ears, and an emotional roller-coaster in my heart, but it was truly spectacular. Trust me when I say that this is a play not to be missed. It is sensational.'}, ignore_index=True)\n",
