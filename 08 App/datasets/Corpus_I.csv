0,﻿﻿THE TIMES,6.1.10 ,Nightingale This,THE LADY OR THE TIGER Revival of musical,Orange Tree,"Benedict Nightingale This dinky little musical has a special meaning for the Orange Tree. The company first presented it in 1975 in a room above the pub next to its present premises and took it into the West End after it was revived in the same attic in 1989. But, sorry, it needs a lot of seasonal goodwill — and the season is fading fast—to welcome the show back into the theatre’s custom-built headquarters. It’s best seen, if at all, while filled with mulled wine and primed to join in a panto-style number that involves whirling your arms “like chariot wheels”. The problem is that Michael Richmond and Jeremy Paul’s plot ventures, in mildly satiric style, into fairytale territory that was covered in thoroughly satiric style by that great under-recognised dramatist, W. S. Gilbert Take a look at his texts for The Palace of Truth or, indeed, for several of the librettos he wrote for Sullivan, and you can imagine the frisson and bite he’d have brought to the story of the “semi- barbaric” but would-be sophisticated king, who sets fatal tasks, such as finding the tail feathers of the near-extinct kogo, to those who come as suitors for his daughter’s hand. Riona O’Connor brings a fine, forthright voice to the pleasant songs Nola York has composed for the virginal and frustrated princess; Howard Samuels is less the “loveable tyrant” the programme claims than a chirpy psychotic, and Andrew C. Wadsworth makes the best of several roles, mainly an obsequious prime minister and the evening’s narrator. But, really, there isn’t too much to narrate. Eke Chukwu’s Hero, who is a charming if slightly stolid “guy with a guitar”, turns up, is promptly grabbed by the terminally randy princess and, before long, menaced by the King, who is looking for an exemplary victim to star in the opening of some grand new arena. That’s where the title comes in. Poor Hero has to choose between two doors, behind one of which is a voracious tiger and behind the other a woman we never actually meet: a pity, as she’s famous for her beauty and for the wit the show somewhat lacks. What will he do? The programme for Sam Walters’ good-natured production asks audiences not to reveal the ending to friends, Japanese tourists, animal right activists, anyone. Sadly, there isn’t much to reveal, but at least there’s a reprise of the song that sent me out of the theatre humming if not feeling, thinking, happy or unhappy: die undeniably tuneful.",51.464281,-0.3016356,0,2,5,2,0,3,1,3,3,1,5,Show_Cat,0.085,0.778,0.136,0.9766,0.09608953971198869,0.4597623464970402,0.01,0.34,0.15,0.24,0.25,"[('satiric', 0.14340406087243043), ('style', 0.14340406087242907), ('princess', 0.14083774787192266), ('eke', 0.12144127677485068), ('stolid', 0.12144127677485053), ('fatal', 0.1214412767748504), ('new', 0.1214412767748504), ('thinking', 0.12144127677485028), ('prime', 0.12144127677485027)]",['Benedict Nightingale This dinky little musical has a special meaning for the Orange Tree'],"[' Sadly, there isn’t much to reveal, but at least there’s a reprise of the song that sent me out of the theatre humming if not feeling, thinking, happy or unhappy: die undeniably tuneful']","['Benedict Nightingale This dinky little musical has a special meaning for the Orange Tree', ' The company first presented it in 1975 in a room above the pub next to its present premises and took it into the West End after it was revived in the same attic in 1989']","[' What will he do?

1,GUARDIAN,7.1.10,Michael Billington ,THE LADY OR THE TIGER Revival of musical,Orange Tree," Sam Walters clearly has a soft spot for this toothless musical. It was first seen at the original Orange Tree pub theatre in 1975, it was revived in 1989 and is now getting its third and, I sincerely hope, final outing. Although Nola York’s tunes are perfectly pleasing, they are tethered to a supposedly adult fairytale that falls awkwardly between two stools - and makes Salad Days look like a model of biting astringency. The basic problem lies in the book by the late Michael Richmond and Jeremy Paul. Set in some mythical kingdom, it features a barbaric tyrant who practises compulsory euthanasia, harbours incestuous longings for his princess daughter and delights in public carnage. To celebrate the opening of a new arena, he demands a hapless victim be confronted by a choice between two doors. Behind one lies a seductive enchantress, behind the other a tiger. Since the princess’s new boyfriend is the victim, and she knows the secret of the doors, she has to choose between sacrificing her lover to another woman or allowing him to be eaten alive. The moral dilemma, which it takes more than two hours to reach, is a no-brainer. The stoiy is thin, and the songs are simply a means of padding out the situation. Admittedly, some are good: the title tune is catchy, the princess has a vampish torch song and, at one point, there is even a panto-style song in which the audience are invited to imitate flapping birds or wriggling fish. York, who once sang with the Chantelles, has an instinct for melody, and the cast, under Walters’s direction and Keith Strachan’s musical supervision, perform gamely. Andrew C Wadsworth lends the king’s factotum the right air of amused detachment and Riona O’Connor’s princess has an upfront ebullience. But, although the musical clearly aspires to the topsy-turveydom of Gilbert and Sullivan, it lacks their satirical zest. I spent the evening pondering the melancholy state of the British musical. Andrew Lloyd Webber effortlessly dominates the scene. But who else is there? Howard Goodall tapped into the British choral tradition in The Hired Man but has never capitalised on that success. Stiles and Drewe wrote popular children’s piece Honk!, but have yet to achieve an adult breakthrough. Whether because of economics, lack of encouragement or failure of ambition, the British musical seems a languishing, lacklustre affair. Its besetting vice is a jovial tweeness all too accurately embodied by the specimen currently on view in Richmond.",51.464281,-0.3016356,0,1,2,1,0,3,0,0,1,2,3,Theatre_Cat,0.06,0.828,0.111,0.9646,0.03786467156032374,0.3869988706945228,0.09,0.36,0.11,0.32,0.13,"[('musical', 0.18205417189782666), ('adult', 0.15908610859966996), ('clearly', 0.12137496001248851), ('problem', 0.12099506851242516), ('new', 0.12099506851242509), ('flapping', 0.12099506851242507), ('michael', 0.12099506851242499), ('paul', 0.12099506851242492), ('goodall', 0.1209950685124249), ('lacklustre', 0.12099506851242489)]",[' Sam Walters clearly has a soft spot for this toothless musical'],[' Its besetting vice is a jovial tweeness all too accurately embodied by the specimen currently on view in Richmond'],"[' Sam Walters clearly has a soft spot for this toothless musical', ' It was first seen at the original Orange Tree pub theatre in 1975, it was revived in 1989 and is now getting its third and, I sincerely hope, final outing']","[' Whether because of economics, lack of encouragement or failure of ambition, the British musical seems a languishing, lacklustre affair', ' Its besetting vice is a jovial tweeness all too accurately embodied by the specimen currently on view in Richmond']","[' Sam Walters clearly has a soft spot for this toothless musical', ' It was first seen at the original Orange Tree pub theatre in 1975, it was revived in 1989 and is now getting its third and, I sincerely hope, final outing', ' Although Nola York’s tunes are perfectly pleasing, they are tethered to a supposedly adult fairytale that falls awkwardly between two stools - and makes Salad Days look like a model of biting astringency']","[' Stiles and Drewe wrote popular children’s piece Honk!, but have yet to achieve an adult breakthrough', ' Whether because of economics, lack of encouragement or failure of ambition, the British musical seems a languishing, lacklustre affair', ' Its besetting vice is a jovial tweeness all too accurately embodied by the specimen currently on view in Richmond']",21,12,20,43,40,77,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4.73,5.0,4.32,5.55,4.7,5.48,Michael,male,"['sam', 'walter', 'clearly', 'soft', 'spot', 'toothless', 'musical', 'first', 'seen', 'original', 'orange', 'tree', 'pub', 'theatre', '1975', 'revived', '1989', 'getting', 'third', 'and', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'final', 'outing', 'although', 'nola', 'york’s', 'tune', 'perfectly', 'pleasing', 'tethered', 'supposedly', 'adult', 'fairytale', 'fall', 'awkwardly', 'two', 'stool', 'make', 'salad', 'day', 'look', 'like', 'model', 'biting', 'astringency', 'basic', 'problem', 'lie', 'book', 'late', 'michael', 'richmond', 'jeremy', 'paul', 'set', 'mythical', 'kingdom', 'feature', 'barbaric', 'tyrant', 'practises', 'compulsory', 'euthanasia', 'harbour', 'incestuous', 'longing', 'princess', 'daughter', 'delight', 'public', 'carnage', 'celebrate', 'opening', 'new', 'arena', 'demand', 'hapless', 'victim', 'confronted', 'choice', 'two', 'door', 'behind', 'one', 'lie', 'seductive', 'enchantress', 'behind', 'tiger', 'since', 'princess’s', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'victim', 'know', 'secret', 'door', 'choose', 'sacrificing', 'lover', 'another', 'woman', 'allowing', 'eaten', 'alive', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'take', 'two', 'hour', 'reach', 'nobrainer', 'stoiy', 'thin', 'song', 'simply', 'mean', 'padding', 'situation', 'admittedly', 'good', 'title', 'tune', 'catchy', 'princess', 'vampish', 'torch', 'song', 'and', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'pantostyle', 'song', 'audience', 'invited', 'imitate', 'flapping', 'bird', 'wriggling', 'fish', 'york', 'sang', 'chantelles', 'instinct', 'melody', 'cast', 'walters’s', 'direction', 'keith', 'strachan’s', 'musical', 'supervision', 'perform', 'gamely', 'andrew', 'c', 'wadsworth', 'lends', 'king’s', 'factotum', 'right', 'air', 'amused', 'detachment', 'riona', 'o’connor’s', 'princess', 'upfront', 'ebullience', 'but', 'although', 'musical', 'clearly', 'aspires', 'topsyturveydom', 'gilbert', 'sullivan', 'lack', 'satirical', 'zest', 'spent', 'evening', 'pondering', 'melancholy', 'state', 'british', 'musical', 'andrew', 'lloyd', 'webber', 'effortlessly', 'dominates', 'scene', 'else', 'there', 'howard', 'goodall', 'tapped', 'british', 'choral', 'tradition', 'hired', 'man', 'never', 'capitalised', 'success', 'stile', 'drewe', 'wrote', 'popular', 'children’s', 'piece', 'honk', 'yet', 'achieve', 'adult', 'breakthrough', 'whether', 'economics', 'lack', 'encouragement', 'failure', 'ambition', 'british', 'musical', 'seems', 'languishing', 'lacklustre', 'affair', 'besetting', 'vice', 'jovial', 'tweeness', 'accurately', 'embodied', 'specimen', 'currently', 'view', 'richmond']",cluster5,"(4, '0.008*""play"" + 0.007*""production"" + 0.004*""one"" + 0.004*""comedy"" + 0.004*""like"" + 0.003*""stage"" + 0.003*""—"" + 0.003*""shakespeare"" + 0.003*""make"" + 0.003*""actor""')"
2,DAILY TELEGRAPH,7.1.10,Charles Spencer ,THE LADY OR THE TIGER Revival of musical,Orange Tree," Unbelievably, The Lady or the Tiger is one of the Orange Tree’s biggest hits. When the musical first opened in 1975 it created huge queues at the box office, returned for an equally successful Christmas run, and later transferred to the West End. So it was every expectation of a great night out that I braved the ice and headed for Richmond for this revival. God I wish I hadn’t bothered. There’s a horrible tweeness about it, and a complete inability to decide whether it is aimed at adults or children. It comes as absolutely no surprise to learn that its creators, Michael Richmond and Nola York, wrote scripts and songs for Listen with Mother. It’s infantile to the point of fatuity, though there is also a curious lubricity about the lyrics which sits oddly with Sam Walters’s completely sexless production of a show ostensibly dealing with love and desire. The action is set in “a semi-barbaric” country presided over by a “loveable’? tyrant whose idea of fun is compulsory euthanasia for those over 65 and snuff-fests in which citizens are put to violent death for the edification and entertainment of the rest of the populace. His latest wheeze is to make some sap choose between two doors in his spanking new arena. One will conceal a tiger which will maul the participant the death. The other will hide a beautiful lady, whom the subject will be allowed to marry. What larks! A poor wandering minstrel is selected for the task, which is bad news as the king’s daughter has’ fallen in love with him, and she isn’t going to be the woman behind the doors. G&S or Shaw might have made something sharply satirical out of this, but this tame script lacks claws. Just occasionally the lyrics aspire to wit, as in a duet between the eponymous lady and tiger in which female and feline conclude “Tonight without any fuss/he’ll be inside one of us.” But the show’s assumption that tyrants are really rather amusing coves, and the disgraceful cop-out of an ending quickly exhaust patience, while the dread moment when the audience is bullied into singing a Listen-with-Mother ditty about tiie wheels of the chariot going round and round, complete with accompanying hand gestures, is a crueller torture than anything the king can devise. At that moment death by tiger seemed infinitely preferable to sitting through this lamentable production. With a cast of only four and a band of two, the show feels underpowered and underpopulated, while the music is derivative, pop-lite pap. Howard Samuels makes an infantile, irritating king, and there isn’t the faintest flicker of a spark between Riona O’Connor’s pert Princess and Eke Chukwu’s bland minstrel. s Only that most reliable of musical troupers Andrew C Wadsworth survives with his dignity more ors less intact as all-purpose factotum and narrator, but even he can’t save this blush-making, cringeinducing disaster of a show.

3,FINANCIAL TIMES,8.1.10,Sarah Hemming ,THE LADY OR THE TIGER Revival of musical,Orange Tree," Party political leaders in search of eye-catching policies to spice up their manifestos for this year’s UK election campaign could tty heading down to the Orange Tree for a few tips. Here the king in The Lady or the Tiger takes a pragmatic approach to education problems (“no education”), strikes over wages (“no wages”) and an ageing populace. The show spells out his tyrannical tactics in a jaunty little ditty, which is typical of this good-natured but overly whimsical musical by Michael Richmond and Jeremy Paul. It has a special place in Orange Tree history, having played at the theatre’s original tiny venue in 1975 to packed houses and queues around the block before shifting to the West End and being revived in 1989. Maybe tastes have changed, for though it is laced with chirpy songs (music by Nola York) and performed here with gusto and charm, it still doesn’t quite persuade that it merits this revival. The story - a spin on the classic fairy tale, based on Frank Stockton’s original short story - is too slight, which given the pantomime tone of the show need not matter, except that it is not witty or ingenious enough to hold out for two hours. Still, if you are prepared to put your party hat back on and enter into the spirit of the occasion, there are plenty of droll details in Sam Walters’ cheerful production. Howard Samuels brings vigour, unpredictability and a certain twinkle to the volatile monarch (at one point he weeps on the shoulder of one bemused spectator). Riona O’Connor is splendidly raunchy as his daughter, who wants to escape her demure confinement as princess and roll in the grass with a handsome stranger. Eke Chukwu, meanwhile, is suitably baffled as the stranger in question, who subsequently finds himself on the wrong end of the king’s temper and facing trial-bydoor: cast into a large arena, he must choose between two doors, one of which conceals a lady, the other a tiger. There is also sterling work from Greg Last and Tom Sellwood, who, as the two-man band, deliver the music with wry aplomb. Between them, they all keep the ball in the air, but it’s hard work.",51.464281,-0.3016356,1,1,5,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,Show_Cat,0.052,0.818,0.13,0.9844,0.02697751322751323,0.4825661375661375,0.15,0.37,0.2,0.2,0.1,"[('work', 0.1354778026264658), ('end', 0.13547780262646558), ('spectator', 0.13547780262646553), ('education', 0.1354778026264655), ('little', 0.1354778026264655), ('band', 0.13547780262646544), ('party', 0.1205127432070384), ('tale', 0.1205127432070383), ('fairy', 0.12051274320703825)]",[' Party political leaders in search of eye-catching policies to spice up their manifestos for this year’s UK election campaign could tty heading down to the Orange Tree for a few tips'],"[' Between them, they all keep the ball in the air, but it’s hard work']","[' Party political leaders in search of eye-catching policies to spice up their manifestos for this year’s UK election campaign could tty heading down to the Orange Tree for a few tips', ' Here the king in The Lady or the Tiger takes a pragmatic approach to education problems (“no education”), strikes over wages (“no wages”) and an ageing populace']","[' There is also sterling work from Greg Last and Tom Sellwood, who, as the two-man band, deliver the music with wry aplomb', ' Between them, they all keep the ball in the air, but it’s hard work']","[' Party political leaders in search of eye-catching policies to spice up their manifestos for this year’s UK election campaign could tty heading down to the Orange Tree for a few tips', ' Here the king in The Lady or the Tiger takes a pragmatic approach to education problems (“no education”), strikes over wages (“no wages”) and an ageing populace', ' The show spells out his tyrannical tactics in a jaunty little ditty, which is typical of this good-natured but overly whimsical musical by Michael Richmond and Jeremy Paul']","[' Eke Chukwu, meanwhile, is suitably baffled as the stranger in question, who subsequently finds himself on the wrong end of the king’s temper and facing trial-bydoor: cast into a large arena, he must choose between two doors, one of which conceals a lady, the other a tiger', ' There is also sterling work from Greg Last and Tom Sellwood, who, as the two-man band, deliver the music with wry aplomb', ' Between them, they all keep the ball in the air, but it’s hard work']",13,32,15,60,38,89,86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.87,3.86,4.91,4.25,4.99,4.57,Sarah,female,"['party', 'political', 'leader', 'search', 'eyecatching', 'policy', 'spice', 'manifesto', 'year’s', 'uk', 'election', 'campaign', 'could', 'tty', 'heading', 'orange', 'tree', 'tip', 'king', 'lady', 'tiger', 'take', 'pragmatic', 'approach', 'education', 'problem', '“no', 'education”', 'strike', 'wage', '“no', 'wages”', 'ageing', 'populace', 'show', 'spell', 'tyrannical', 'tactic', 'jaunty', 'little', 'ditty', 'typical', 'goodnatured', 'overly', 'whimsical', 'musical', 'michael', 'richmond', 'jeremy', 'paul', 'special', 'place', 'orange', 'tree', 'history', 'played', 'theatre’s', 'original', 'tiny', 'venue', '1975', 'packed', 'house', 'queue', 'around', 'block', 'shifting', 'west', 'end', 'revived', '1989', 'maybe', 'taste', 'changed', 'though', 'laced', 'chirpy', 'song', 'music', 'nola', 'york', 'performed', 'gusto', 'charm', 'still', 'doesn’t', 'quite', 'persuade', 'merit', 'revival', 'story', 'spin', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'based', 'frank', 'stockton’s', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'slight', 'given', 'pantomime', 'tone', 'show', 'need', 'matter', 'except', 'witty', 'ingenious', 'enough', 'hold', 'two', 'hour', 'still', 'prepared', 'put', 'party', 'hat', 'back', 'enter', 'spirit', 'occasion', 'plenty', 'droll', 'detail', 'sam', 'walters’', 'cheerful', 'production', 'howard', 'samuel', 'brings', 'vigour', 'unpredictability', 'certain', 'twinkle', 'volatile', 'monarch', 'at', 'one', 'point', 'weeps', 'shoulder', 'one', 'bemused', 'spectator', 'riona', 'o’connor', 'splendidly', 'raunchy', 'daughter', 'want', 'escape', 'demure', 'confinement', 'princess', 'roll', 'grass', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'eke', 'chukwu', 'meanwhile', 'suitably', 'baffled', 'stranger', 'question', 'subsequently', 'find', 'wrong', 'end', 'king’s', 'temper', 'facing', 'trialbydoor', 'cast', 'large', 'arena', 'must', 'choose', 'two', 'door', 'one', 'conceals', 'lady', 'tiger', 'also', 'sterling', 'work', 'greg', 'last', 'tom', 'sellwood', 'who', 'twoman', 'band', 'deliver', 'music', 'wry', 'aplomb', 'them', 'keep', 'ball', 'air', 'it’s', 'hard', 'work']",cluster5,"(4, '0.008*""play"" + 0.007*""production"" + 0.004*""one"" + 0.004*""comedy"" + 0.004*""like"" + 0.003*""stage"" + 0.003*""—"" + 0.003*""shakespeare"" + 0.003*""make"" + 0.003*""actor""')"
4,JEWISH CHRONICLE,8.1.10,John Nathan ,THE LADY OR THE TIGER Revival of musical,Orange Tree," Michael Richmond’s and Nola York’s quirky little musical made its debut at the Orange Tree in 1975 and, judging by this revival, overreached and overachieved when it transferred to the Fortune Theatre in the West End. Perhaps it became a victim of its own success. The show built up quite a following when it first appeared. Queues went around the block when the block was the pub in whose upstairs room founding Orange Tree artistic director Sam Walters set up shop in 1971. These days the venue has its own building over the road. The run at the Fortune ended after just five weeks — too short to be considered anything other than a failure, but in the long catalogue of West End crashes, far from embarrassing. Much worse shows have lasted longer. Much better shows have closed more quickly. But anyone coming to The Lady or the Tiger afresh is bound to wonder what all the fuss was about. The pleasingly silly premise is drawn from a story by the 19th-century American humorist Frank Stockton. The action takes place in what Andrew C Wadsworth's amiable, fez-wearing factotum calls a ""semi-barbaric kingdom” — a country run by Howard Samuels’s ironically short Highness. In the programme this king is described as a lovable tyrant, though in truth he makes Caligula look like Harold Macmillan. Laws include compulsory bingo in which losers are executed, orgies are encouraged, and — government take note — the Ducie Supremo, as he likes to be known, has hit upon a novel way to control both population and pension costs — his subjects are put to death at the age of 65. It is a policy that would have a drastic effect on the Orange Tree’s box office. Apart from National Theatre matinees, this theatre probably attracts the oldest demographic of any venue. A colleague once told me he saw a show here in which, whatever direction the cast performed — the auditorium is a cosy circle — they were faced by snoozing patrons with their chins resting on their cashmere-covered chests. That was not the case on this night — although there was one elderly chap sitting opposite me who valiantly fought the urge to drop off by viewing the entire two-and-a-quarter-hour show through just one open eye. This is no particular indictment of the musical or Waters's peppy production. There are longeurs but mostly they are entertainingly filled by musicians Greg Last and Tom Sellwood, who impress with an array of instruments including a double-bass that is heartily slapped jive-style and a tuba whose delicious tone hits you like a deeptissue massage. One number even prompts a sing-along with the audience. Don't worry — it is all done in the potty, fun-loving spirit of the evening, with everyone singing a childish little ditty beloved by the king about how chariot wheels go round and round and which has similarly insightful observations about fish in ponds and the wings of birds. By now you could be forgiven for thinking that plot is not the point of an evening in which the late Michael Richmond’s lyrics provide rude wit — for example, a life can apparently be measured ""from sperm to worm”. There is also some very good singing delivered by Riona O Connor as the king's 25-year-old daughter, ""daddy’s little girl” who yearns for some grown up hanky panky. But you would be wrong about the plot. For the evening builds to a diverting little dilemma. As with Stockton’s story, the stage version of The Lady or the Tiger features a minstrel who is punished for falling for (and in bed with) the sex-starved princess. So he has to take part in the king’s harebrained form of justice which involves choosing between two doors. Behind one awaits a hungry tiger, behind the other, the most beautiful woman in the land —not the Princess. The minstrel’s guilt will be determined by which door he chooses. But the real dilemma is the Princess's. Does she save her beau by having him choose the unseen mysterious lady, or does she show him the tiger door and save herself a life of jealousy? What Would You Do? —performed directly at the audience — is the show’s catchiest tune. It would be wrong to tell you the end. But still, a little reworking of Richmond’s and Jeremy Paul’s book — maybe starting with the dilemma and playing the rest of the story in flashback — would have given this show some much-needed tension. Quite how in 1975 the producers thought that this musical could make it in the West End is an utter mystery. But you can see why Walters looks back with fondness on the thing. It has charm, and thanks to Nola York’s melodies, some better than average songwriting. And in the Orange Tree’s snug auditorium, it delivers a warming evening in this brutally cold January.",51.464281,-0.3016356,0,2,4,3,0,4,1,0,2,1,4,Show_Cat,0.082,0.789,0.129,0.9932,0.05097222222222221,0.4964141414141414,0.07,0.38,0.12,0.22,0.21,"[('little', 0.26510715908817956), ('tiger',
