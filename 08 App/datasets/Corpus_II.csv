5,OBSERVER,10.1.10,Susannah Clapp ,THE LADY OR THE TIGER Revival of musical,Orange Tree," This is the season in which theatres revisit their histories. In the crumbling glory of Wilton’s Music Hall, east London, Fiona Shaw is reprising her wild version of The Waste Land, talking about death in the City, with the aid of Music Hall voices. Hackney Empire has burst into its traditional life with rousing panto. Meanwhile, the Orange Tree is producing The Lady or the Tiger, which had its premiere at the theatre in 1975 and was revived there in 1989. Now it’s back again; I wish it wasn’t. Based on a whimsical 1882 story by Frank Stockton, the show has words by Michael Richmond and Jeremy Paul and music by Nola York, who once sang with the Chantelles and was the first woman to write a complete score for a West End musical. It has a few good mots, a dash of sauce, but hardly any point It features one despotic ruler who follows his subjects’ every wiggle “from sperm to worm”, one reluctantly virgin daughter (“Think of your position”; “I am, I wish it was horizontal”), one drippy suitor and one multipurpose character who flips from role to role by changing his hat. Riona O’Connor has a suitably 70s Lulu-like shout of a voice but does too much gurgling to be really convincing as a grown-up: she sings better than she swings. As the naughty king - ooh what a scamp that tyrant is - Howard Samuels dispenses oeillades, pecks on the cheeks and pats on the knees to the ladies in the front row. Sam Walters’s production is almost eerily pleasant.

6,TIME OUT LONDON,21.1.10,Lucy Powell ,THE LADY OR THE TIGER Revival of musical,Orange Tree," This pint-sized, panto-inflected musical from Michael Richmond, Jeremy Paul and Nola York was a decided smash for the newly minted Orange Tree in 1975, returning in 1986, when it transferred to the West End. But this warm-hearted revival from Sam Walters proves one too many. Based on an 1882 story by Frank Stockton, an oh-so-lovable dictator devises a novel way to try his criminals. In a vast arena, the accused, who is also the lust object for an extraordinarily frustrated Princess, must choose between two doors. Behind one lies a blushing bride; behind the other, a ferocious, four-legged feline. Death, then, or the maiden. The programme begs us not to divulge the denouement, but in the event there isn’t one, merely a reflection of the musical’s own, crippling internal confusion. Neither the tightening fist of despotism nor the potentially radical revisionism of love are worked through with any drive or direction at all. With a wonderfully throaty, tuneful turn from Riona O’Connor as the panting Princess, and a charmingly blithe King from Howard Samuels, it’s winsomely ridiculous, and seasonally diverting enough.

7,INDEPENDENT,7.1.10,ZoE Anderson ,VAREKAI Return of show,Royal Albert Hall," Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Cirque du Soleil has become the biggest brand in world circus. “Brand” is the word, because there’s something very corporate about this Canadian company’s approach to circus. The performers are spectacular: Varekai includes some astonishing feats, from intricate balancing acts to Russian swings. The framing show is blandly predictable. Creators Guy Laliberty and Dominic Champagne give Varekai a vague narrative about Icarus falling from the sky, meeting and eventually marrying a contortionist bride. This isn’t exactly a story. There’s no fear in Icarus’s fall, however elegantly Mark Halasi dives and swings in his net trapeze. None of these characters will ever get truly scared, or risky. It’s all vague uplift. Cirque du Soleil’s trademark magical creatures waft about, expressing non-specific wonder and amazement. Eiko Ishioka’s costumes and Nathalie Gagnd’s make-up designs are instantly recognisable as Cirque du Soleil style. There are lizard spines, frilly ruffs, all in shiny fabrics and contrasting colours. The make-up is laid on thick, with lurid colours. The performers are turned into types, with little space for individuality. The clowns are predictable, too. Steven Bishop and Mooky Cornish keep popping up as incompetent ushers, an incompetent magic act, incompetent singers. Other clowns babble at the wonders of the sky, or mime elaborate routines to sound effects. Even the circus acts can be muted by the prevailing waffle. Bombastic rock opera singing, vague gestures and heavy costuming take the edge off the slippery surface act. Varekai takes off only when it focuses on the basics of its circus routines, the wonders of balance and control. Dergin Tokmak writhes and pounces across the stage on crutches, loping his way through twisting balances. Octavio Alegria juggles hats, throwing some in boomerang circles as he flips the others from hand to head. He even juggles with his mouth, spitting out ping-pong balls until he seems to be gargling them. In the “Icarian Games”, one performer lies with legs in the air. His partner starts out perched on his feet, then flips over and over, like a human Catherine wheel. Georgian dancers whirl on their knees, stomping and leaping. Irina Naumenko ties herself in impossible knots while balancing on canes. Best of all is the finale, with acrobats leaping from big swings. The extra momentum sends them high into the air, flipping and turning before landing, rock solid, in the catchers’ hands. The jumps and throws get bigger and wilder, men crossing in mid-air, landing in pyramid balances or diving down billowing nets to the ground.",51.5009088,-0.177366,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,4,2,1,4,Character_Cat,0.062,0.872,0.066,0.5574,0.009566993464052294,0.4910457516339869,0.13,0.39,0.03,0.17,0.28,"[('act', 0.19131194044412342), ('balances', 0.17459188874250758), ('vague', 0.1513415774039472), ('varekai', 0.1473276004470702), ('rock', 0.14430159099192572), ('circus', 0.139835899146489), ('incompetent', 0.13511401892959024), ('magic', 0.1340279073527332), ('air', 0.1221072644783858), ('men', 0.1107049527299793)]","[' Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Cirque du Soleil has become the biggest brand in world circus']","[' The jumps and throws get bigger and wilder, men crossing in mid-air, landing in pyramid balances or diving down billowing nets to the ground']","[' Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Cirque du Soleil has become the biggest brand in world circus', ' “Brand” is the word, because there’s something very corporate about this Canadian company’s approach to circus']","[' The extra momentum sends them high into the air, flipping and turning before landing, rock solid, in the catchers’ hands', ' The jumps and throws get bigger and wilder, men crossing in mid-air, landing in pyramid balances or diving down billowing nets to the ground']","[' Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Cirque du Soleil has become the biggest brand in world circus', ' “Brand” is the word, because there’s something very corporate about this Canadian company’s approach to circus', ' The performers are spectacular: Varekai includes some astonishing feats, from intricate balancing acts to Russian swings']","[' Best of all is the finale, with acrobats leaping from big swings', ' The extra momentum sends them high into the air, flipping and turning before landing, rock solid, in the catchers’ hands', ' The jumps and throws get bigger and wilder, men crossing in mid-air, landing in pyramid balances or diving down billowing nets to the ground']",31,18,25,35,46,52,59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.24,4.88,5.58,4.95,5.9,4.84,ZoE,unknown,"['celebrating', '25th', 'anniversary', 'year', 'cirque', 'du', 'soleil', 'become', 'biggest', 'brand', 'world', 'circus', '“brand”', 'word', 'there’s', 'something', 'corporate', 'canadian', 'company’s', 'approach', 'circus', 'performer', 'spectacular', 'varekai', 'includes', 'astonishing', 'feat', 'intricate', 'balancing', 'act', 'russian', 'swing', 'framing', 'show', 'blandly', 'predictable', 'creator', 'guy', 'laliberty', 'dominic', 'champagne', 'give', 'varekai', 'vague', 'narrative', 'icarus', 'falling', 'sky', 'meeting', 'eventually', 'marrying', 'contortionist', 'bride', 'isn’t', 'exactly', 'story', 'there’s', 'fear', 'icarus’s', 'fall', 'however', 'elegantly', 'mark', 'halasi', 'dive', 'swing', 'net', 'trapeze', 'none', 'character', 'ever', 'get', 'truly', 'scared', 'risky', 'it’s', 'vague', 'uplift', 'cirque', 'du', 'soleil’s', 'trademark', 'magical', 'creature', 'waft', 'about', 'expressing', 'nonspecific', 'wonder', 'amazement', 'eiko', 'ishioka’s', 'costume', 'nathalie', 'gagnd’s', 'makeup', 'design', 'instantly', 'recognisable', 'cirque', 'du', 'soleil', 'style', 'lizard', 'spine', 'frilly', 'ruff', 'shiny', 'fabric', 'contrasting', 'colour', 'makeup', 'laid', 'thick', 'lurid', 'colour', 'performer', 'turned', 'type', 'little', 'space', 'individuality', 'clown', 'predictable', 'too', 'steven', 'bishop', 'mooky', 'cornish', 'keep', 'popping', 'incompetent', 'usher', 'incompetent', 'magic', 'act', 'incompetent', 'singer', 'clown', 'babble', 'wonder', 'sky', 'mime', 'elaborate', 'routine', 'sound', 'effect', 'even', 'circus', 'act', 'muted', 'prevailing', 'waffle', 'bombastic', 'rock', 'opera', 'singing', 'vague', 'gesture', 'heavy', 'costuming', 'take', 'edge', 'slippery', 'surface', 'act', 'varekai', 'take', 'focus', 'basic', 'circus', 'routine', 'wonder', 'balance', 'control', 'dergin', 'tokmak', 'writhes', 'pounce', 'across', 'stage', 'crutch', 'loping', 'way', 'twisting', 'balance', 'octavio', 'alegria', 'juggle', 'hat', 'throwing', 'boomerang', 'circle', 'flip', 'others', 'hand', 'head', 'even', 'juggle', 'mouth', 'spitting', 'pingpong', 'ball', 'seems', 'gargling', 'them', '“icarian', 'games”', 'one', 'performer', 'lie', 'leg', 'air', 'partner', 'start', 'perched', 'foot', 'flip', 'over', 'like', 'human', 'catherine', 'wheel', 'georgian', 'dancer', 'whirl', 'knee', 'stomping', 'leaping', 'irina', 'naumenko', 'tie', 'impossible', 'knot', 'balancing', 'cane', 'best', 'finale', 'acrobat', 'leaping', 'big', 'swing', 'extra', 'momentum', 'sends', 'high', 'air', 'flipping', 'turning', 'landing', 'rock', 'solid', 'catchers’', 'hand', 'jump', 'throw', 'get', 'bigger', 'wilder', 'men', 'crossing', 'midair', 'landing', 'pyramid', 'balance', 'diving', 'billowing', 'net', 'ground']",,
8,DAILY TELEGRAPH,7.1.10,Charles Spencer ,VAREKAI Return of show,Royal Albert Hall," Thanks to a muddle over tickets, I took my seat a few minutes late for Varekai, this year’s Cirque du Soleil show, with murder in my heart and steam coming out of my ears. The hideously unfunny clown performing the opening routine did absolutely nothing to make me feel better. And in truth there is a lot to dislike about Cirque du Soleil, the global circus brand. This year, the souvenir programmes are virtually devoid of information and cost a ridiculous £12. If you want the red-carpet treatment, a VIP package will cost you £180, while regular top-price seats are £75. If you are prepared to sit way up in the gods, prices do start at a more manageable £20.1 was placed here myself initially, hence the rage, since you feel several miles away from die action. Overpriced, over-slick and over here it may be, but the fact remains that, at its best, Cirque du Soleil offers the most spectacular entertainment available anywhere in the world. And while its touring shows can’t compete with its resident Las Vegas productions, which include die beautiful, waterbased ‘O’ and the blissful Beatles show Love, there are still many moments when you can’t quite believe the evidence of your own eyes. Varekai, back in the Smoke after an earlier outing in 2008, is one of its best travelling productions. As usual the story-line is as exiguous as it is impenetrable, this time Dominic Champagne Stephane Roy Eiko Ishioka Nol van Genuchten Francois Bergeron Michael Montanaro Bill Shannon Violaine Corradi involving a winged, Icarus-like figure who tumbles to earth from the heavens and finds himself in a forest at the summit of a volcano, a place populated by fantastic creatures, impersonated by the ensemble, that look like a cross between scary insects and exotic fruit. But it’s the acts that matter and they are sensational. The aerial sequence involving two British performers, Andrew and Kevin Atherton, who, suspended on straps, soar round the vast Albert Hall arena like a pair of dark angels, even impressed Mrs Spencer, a former dancer, with its balletic line and grace. The triple trapeze routine featuring four glamorous women also has a heart-catching grace about it, while there is something creepily erotic as well as otherworldly about Irina Naumenko, the litheness of whose body as she performs handbalances on canes suggests that she has bones made of rubber. As she neatly tucks her feet beneath her chin you seem to be looking at a creature from another planet. As Mr Spock might observe, it’s gymnastics, Jim, but not as we know it Other treats include a genuinely spectacular juggler, who propels a succession of ping pong balls from his mouth and catches them again in the same orifice and a superb troupe of Cossack dancers, whizzing around the stage on their knees. Best of all is the thrilling grand finale in which acrobats launch themselves from swingboats, somersault many yards through the air and somehow land safely on the shoulders of their colleagues.

9,EVENING STANDARD,7.1.10,Henry Hitchings ,VAREKAI Return of show,Royal Albert Hall," Apparently Varekai is the Romany word for “wherever”, and this characteristically elaborate spectacle by the Canadian company Cirque du Soleil, written and directed by Dominic Champagne, plays with traditional imagery of wandering, rootlessness and flight. The show in fact begins limply, with some charmless clowning and a squeaky-voiced sprite thanking the corporate backers. It relapses a couple of times into mediocrity, notably when yet another clown turns Jacques Brel’s imploring “Ne me quitte pas” into a piece of spotlit slapstick. However, there is a huge amount to admire: beautifully costumed by Eiko Ishioka, the production features thrilling trapeze work, moments of balletic poise, a man on crutches moving more athletically than anyone on Britain’s Got Talent, and a juggler who treats Panama hats as if they are boomerangs. There may be a story of sorts -loosely connected to the myth of Icarus - but the emphasis is on acrobatic moves and slick choreography. The cast’s physical feats are so accomplished that one can lose sight of the risks they involve. Some sections are overlong, and the soundtrack, reminiscent of Claude Challe’s Buddha Bar compilations, is cloying. But the visual feast is rich. Fans will argue about the highlights; for me the standouts are brothers Andrew and Kevin Atherton, swooping dramatically from the roof on lithe elastic straps. At its best Varekai is an exhilarating experience. It has dazzle, imagination, gravity-defying stunts, even a smattering of eroticism. What it needs, perhaps, is more soul.",51.5009088,-0.177366,1,1,4,2,0,2,1,1,0,0,4,Show_Cat,0.047,0.829,0.124,0.9643,0.2427655677655678,0.5208137100994245,0.04,0.48,0.04,0.11,0.33,"[('elaborate', 0.14432179155516478), ('panama', 0.1443217915551647), ('beautifully', 0.14432179155516422), ('bar', 0.14432179155516403), ('elastic', 0.14432179155516356), ('moves', 0.1443217915551635), ('company', 0.14432179155516348), ('loosely', 0.14432179155516348), ('begins', 0.14432179155516286), ('champagne', 0.14432179155516223)]","[' Apparently Varekai is the Romany word for “wherever”, and this characteristically elaborate spectacle by the Canadian company Cirque du Soleil, written and directed by Dominic Champagne, plays with traditional imagery of wandering, rootlessness and flight']","[' What it needs, perhaps, is more soul']","[' Apparently Varekai is the Romany word for “wherever”, and this characteristically elaborate spectacle by the Canadian company Cirque du Soleil, written and directed by Dominic Champagne, plays with traditional imagery of wandering, rootlessness and flight', ' The show in fact begins limply, with some charmless clowning and a squeaky-voiced sprite thanking the corporate backers']","[' It has dazzle, imagination, gravity-defying stunts, even a smattering of eroticism', ' What it needs, perhaps, is more soul']","[' Apparently Varekai is the Romany word for “wherever”, and this characteristically elaborate spectacle by the Canadian company Cirque du Soleil, written and directed by Dominic Champagne, plays with traditional imagery of wandering, rootlessness and flight', ' The show in fact begins limply, with some charmless clowning and a squeaky-voiced sprite thanking the corporate backers', ' It relapses a couple of times into mediocrity, notably when yet another clown turns Jacques Brel’s imploring “Ne me quitte pas” into a piece of spotlit slapstick']","[' At its best Varekai is an exhilarating experience', ' It has dazzle, imagination, gravity-defying stunts, even a smattering of eroticism', ' What it needs, perhaps, is more soul']",13,36,8,55,20,83,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.31,4.29,6.09,5.67,5.72,5.54,Henry,male,"['apparently', 'varekai', 'romany', 'word', '“wherever”', 'characteristically', 'elaborate', 'spectacle', 'canadian', 'company', 'cirque', 'du', 'soleil', 'written', 'directed', 'dominic', 'champagne', 'play', 'traditional', 'imagery', 'wandering', 'rootlessness', 'flight', 'show', 'fact', 'begin', 'limply', 'charmless', 'clowning', 'squeakyvoiced', 'sprite', 'thanking', 'corporate', 'backer', 'relapse', 'couple', 'time', 'mediocrity', 'notably', 'yet', 'another', 'clown', 'turn', 'jacques', 'brel’s', 'imploring', '“ne', 'quitte', 'pas”', 'piece', 'spotlit', 'slapstick', 'however', 'huge', 'amount', 'admire', 'beautifully', 'costumed', 'eiko', 'ishioka', 'production', 'feature', 'thrilling', 'trapeze', 'work', 'moment', 'balletic', 'poise', 'man', 'crutch', 'moving', 'athletically', 'anyone', 'britain’s', 'got', 'talent', 'juggler', 'treat', 'panama', 'hat', 'boomerang', 'may', 'story', 'sort', 'loosely', 'connected', 'myth', 'icarus', 'emphasis', 'acrobatic', 'move', 'slick', 'choreography', 'cast’s', 'physical', 'feat', 'accomplished', 'one', 'lose', 'sight', 'risk', 'involve', 'section', 'overlong', 'soundtrack', 'reminiscent', 'claude', 'challe’s', 'buddha', 'bar', 'compilation', 'cloying', 'visual', 'feast', 'rich', 'fan', 'argue', 'highlight', 'standouts', 'brother', 'andrew', 'kevin', 'atherton', 'swooping', 'dramatically', 'roof', 'lithe', 'elastic', 'strap', 'best', 'varekai', 'exhilarating', 'experience', 'dazzle', 'imagination', 'gravitydefying', 'stunt', 'even', 'smattering', 'eroticism', 'need', 'perhaps', 'soul']",,
